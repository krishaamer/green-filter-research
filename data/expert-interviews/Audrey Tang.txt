... for young people to participate, not just young people but people under 18 don't have anywhere else to participate anyway (laughs) from the old political institutions, so they flock, uh, to the platform. And so on the platform, you see some of the most impact-making petitions from the young people as part of their civic competence work to be all ESG-related. Um, and so there was one from Wanxuan who, uh, who was, like, 16, 17 years old, and it's about banning plastic straw from bubble tea takeouts, which is a big deal because we all believe in bubble tea.

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:30,659[00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:30,659] - [speaker_1]

It's, uh, (laughs) it's like one true religion, uh, (laughs) here. Uh, so look, no matter your spirituality, if you believe in bubble tea. But an- anyway, uh, so the point, uh, to, to change the, the plastic straw that was always associated with bubble tea was a big deal. Uh, and then, uh, but she got a lot of support, uh, from, uh, the 70-year-olds. So the 17 and the 70-year-olds are the natural allies, um, intergenerational members because almost by definition, they have more time on their hands. And, and-

00:01:00,839 --> 00:01:01,519[00:01:00,839 --> 00:01:01,519] - [speaker_1]
(laughs)

00:01:01,499 --> 00:01:07,559[00:01:01,499 --> 00:01:07,559] - [speaker_0]
(laughs) And, and, and also, they care more about the long term. They don't care about the next quarter, right?

00:01:07,539 --> 00:01:07,899[00:01:07,539 --> 00:01:07,899] - [speaker_1]
(laughs)

00:01:07,879 --> 00:02:33,759[00:01:07,879 --> 00:02:33,759] - [speaker_0]
And so, and so that's why they were kind of the new political voices that sprung from this digital democracy and this, like, digital confidence, city confidence. Right? And so they were successful in effecting that change around ESG lines. And the beauty is that the manufacturers of such, uh, straws and so on, got a lot of material support, like impact investing support, um, to invent, like, paper-based straws that does not break or does not, you know, dissolve in water and things like that, and glue-based, there's just many designs like that. And so we see this, uh, like, conflict between the ESG-minded young people and very old people, and the people who have to worry about next quarter not as fire, uh, on the ground to be put out, uh, as in other societies to harmonize or Qǐngé lan， uh, those, uh, conversations, uh, but rather as energy sources that you can harness and create more sustainable solutions. So I do think that this dual transition really works because then it makes the, uh, concern of the young people into a planetary fashion because without such topics, it's always within one jurisdiction, and that still carries a zero-sum mentality. But for things that are ESG-minded, especially around climate and s-, uh, water and planetary system like forests and so on, like, it... those things know no borders. And so once you start the petition based on these things, you have to think in positive-sum ways. So I hope that answered your question.
