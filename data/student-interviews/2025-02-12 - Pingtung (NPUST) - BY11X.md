| **Interviewee:** 因為...呃...好像有一些材質如果不好用的話，可能會有塑化劑或什麼的。然後他這邊有幫我列出來，所以代表說這個產品他沒有。然後如果他用來煮食物的話，應該不會有什麼就是危害人體的東西。                                                                                                                        | **Interviewee:** Because... uh... it seems some materials, if they are not good quality [implying safety], might contain plasticizers or something. And it listed them for me here, so it means this product doesn't have them. And if it's used to cook food, it probably won't have anything harmful to the human body. |

| **Interviewee:** 他寫代號，應該是就是這間公司的代號，然後底下應該就是他列出來的股票的圖表。                                                                                                                                                          | **Interviewee:** It writes code, it should be the code for this company, and below should be the stock charts it listed.                                                                                                                        |

(Looks at chart)... I probably wouldn't buy, because its volatility is a bit too high.                                                                                                         |
