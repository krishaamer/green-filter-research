| **Interviewee:** 他在介紹這一間公司。對，他介紹這間公司它的生產...                                                                                                                                                                      | **Interviewee:** It's introducing this company. Yes, it introduces this company's production...                                                                                                                                                |
| **Interviewer:** 那你覺得這裡介紹裡面的重點是什麼？                                                                                                                                                                                | **Interviewer:** Then what do you think is the main point inside this introduction?                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Interviewee:** 重點應該是跟環境有關的，因為他很多寫永續、環境問題、永續性評級、ESG 評級。對。應該就是主要在講這間公司...等一下，因為聽起來有點大聲，你可以再講一次嗎？                                                                                                                            | **Interviewee:** The main point should be related to the environment, because it writes a lot about sustainability, environmental issues, sustainability rating, ESG rating. Yes. It should mainly be talking about this company... wait, because it sounds a bit loud, can you say it again? |
| **Interviewer:** 好。                                                                                                                                                                                                          | **Interviewer:** Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Interviewee:** 我怕剛剛沒有錄音到。好。我覺得他這個描述感覺比較多著重在這間公司它在環境上的影響。                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewee:** I was afraid it didn't record just now. Okay. I think this description seems to focus more on this company's impact on the environment.                                                                                        |
| **Interviewer:** 好。那你覺得對你來說最重要的點是什麼？                                                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewer:** Okay. Then what do you think is the most important point for you?                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯...最重要...我應該會先看它有沒有負面的，就是對環境有沒有負面的影響。有的話就不會考慮啊。如果就是不確定的話，那我就會以這個產品的功能為主。                                                                                                                            | **Interviewee:** Um... most important... I would probably first see if it has negatives, like if it has a negative impact on the environment. If it does, I won't consider it. If it's just uncertain, then I'll focus on the product's functionality. |
| **Interviewer:** 那你覺得這裡內容裡面有什麼對你來說是新的嗎？你之前不知道的？                                                                                                                                                             | **Interviewer:** Then in the content here, is there anything new for you? That you didn't know before?                                                                                                                                         |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯...新的...我覺得應該一樣，是什麼材料、永續性、環境問題、歷史，然後還有就是他這些...呃...還有勞工問題評級，這些分數還有描述是之前不會知道的事情。                                                                                                                            | **Interviewee:** Um... new... I think it should be the same, what materials, sustainability, environmental issues, history, and also these... uh... also labor issue ratings, these scores and descriptions are things I wouldn't have known before. |
| **Interviewer:** 嗯。那有什麼讓你驚訝的嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                         | **Interviewer:** Um. Was there anything that surprised you?                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| **Interviewee:** 我覺得會考慮耶，就是會考慮。因為像他就友特別講說 All Good 他有使用天然的成分，對，但原本的牌子沒有特別寫。                                                                                                                             | **Interviewee:** I think I would consider, yes, would consider. Because like it specifically mentioned that All Good uses natural ingredients, yes, but the original brand didn't specifically write that.                                             |
