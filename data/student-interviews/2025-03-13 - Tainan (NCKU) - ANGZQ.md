| **Interviewee:** 因為碳排放比較低。                                                                                                                           | **Interviewee:** Because the carbon emissions are lower.                                                                                                                      |

Or do you still want to buy the original one?                                                                                |
| **Interviewee:** 我覺得它如果顯示在頁面旁邊，我會覺得可以換一個品牌。                                                                                       | **Interviewee:** I think if it's displayed beside the page, I would feel like I could switch to another brand.                                                                  |

| **Interviewee:** 投資 (註: TXT 誤聽為 過期) 產品的公司？我覺得這裡好像有點不太明顯。                                                                        | **Interviewee:** Invest in (Note: TXT misheard as "Expired") the product's company? I feel this part seems a bit unclear.                                                     |
| **Me:** 這個跟什麼有關係？                                                                                                                                  | **Me:** What is this related to?                                                                                                                                              |

| **Interviewee:** 嗯...我覺得重點...我覺得重點可能是...還是最重要的，是要多去有主動的一些行動，像是說你可以去直接跟公司反映啊，或者是政策上面的支持，這樣子。          | **Interviewee:** Hmm... I think the point... I think the point might be... still the most important thing is to take more proactive actions, like, say, you can directly give feedback to the company, or support relevant policies, like that. |
