| **Me:** 好，我再問一次，這個是我的論文的一部分的一個App，希望妳幫幫我測試。我會錄音妳的聲音，但是妳的回覆都是匿名的，可以嗎？                                   | **Me:** Okay, let me ask again. This is an app that's part of my thesis. I hope you can help me test it. I will record your voice, but your responses will be anonymous. Is that okay? |
| **Interviewee:** 可以，可以。                                                                                                                               | **Interviewee:** Yes, yes.                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Me:** 好，謝謝。那可以開始了。好。呃，妳之前有用過Momo嗎？                                                                                                | **Me:** Okay, thank you. We can start then. Okay. Uh, have you used Momo before?                                                                                               |
| **Interviewee:** 有，可是用蝦皮比較多。                                                                                                                     | **Interviewee:** Yes, but I use Shopee more often.                                                                                                                            |
| **Me:** 好。那妳平常買什麼？                                                                                                                                | **Me:** Okay. What do you usually buy?                                                                                                                                        |
| **Interviewee:** 平常嗎？衣服跟化妝品，還有動漫的娃娃。                                                                                                     | **Interviewee:** Usually? Clothes and cosmetics, and also anime dolls.                                                                                                        |
| **Me:** 嗯。那妳可以幫我找一個妳有興趣的產品嗎？                                                                                                            | **Me:** Hmm. Can you help me find a product you're interested in?                                                                                                             |
| **Interviewee:** (Searches) ...有興趣的...產品...面膜。                                                                                                     | **Interviewee:** (Searches) ...Interested in... product... facial mask.                                                                                                       |
| **Me:** 面膜？這個？好。這樣。這個品牌妳有之前買過嗎？                                                                                                      | **Me:** Facial mask? This one? Okay. Like this. Have you bought this brand before?                                                                                             |
| **Interviewee:** 哦，有，有買過。                                                                                                                           | **Interviewee:** Oh, yes, I've bought it before.                                                                                                                              |
| **Me:** 哇哇，好酷喔。買東西基本上，買東西也是一個投資...喔，這個是可以幫忙分析的。                                                                           | **Me:** Wow, wow, so cool. Buying things basically, buying things is also an investment... Oh, this can help analyze.                                                        |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯，哇，酷。                                                                                                                               | **Interviewee:** Hmm, wow, cool.                                                                                                                                              |
| **Me:** 那妳覺得這個內容裡面有什麼對妳來說有用、用途嗎？有用，就是妳覺得有趣的資料，還是妳覺得不錯的材料？                                                    | **Me:** What do you think in this content is useful for you, or serves a purpose? Useful, meaning interesting information, or materials you think are good?                |
| **Interviewee:** 可持續性跟這個歷史問題。平常在逛的時候只會看到就是品牌國家跟那個使用材料，很少看到有這個「材料可持續性」跟「歷史問題」，所以買的時候就會覺得說，就是，哦，買完了可能就，就只是用完了也就只是垃圾，但是我沒有想到說，就是，哦，我沒有想到說就是可能面膜它裡面會有一些不明的植物萃取物跟化學保存劑。應該說是知道，可是不知道說就是它可能，嗯，會有存在風險之類的。 | **Interviewee:** Sustainability and this history issue. Usually when browsing, I only see the brand's country and the materials used. I rarely see this "Material Sustainability" and "History Issues". So when buying, I would think, just, oh, after buying it, maybe it's just, after using it up, it's just trash. But I didn't think that, like, oh, I didn't think that maybe the facial mask could contain some unknown plant extracts and chemical preservatives. I should say I knew, but I didn't know that it might, hmm, pose potential risks, things like that. |
| **Me:** 那妳覺得這個，妳剛知道這個會影響妳的，妳的想法嗎？想法嗎？就是因為妳之前 (註: TXT 用 最近) 有買過這個產品，那妳剛知道好像它裡面可能有什麼化學的...妳對妳關於那個這個產品的那個品牌，妳的想法會改嗎？ | **Me:** So you think this, knowing this just now, will it affect your, your thoughts? Your thoughts? Because you have bought this product before (Note: TXT used "recently"), and you just found out it might contain some chemicals... Regarding this product's brand, will your thoughts change? |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯，會有一點點，會有一點點。可能會去找可能更方便的吧，就是不需要用到面膜，可能只要，嗯，要怎麼說...就是有，有看到就是不需要敷面膜，就是很像就是塗那個...塗，塗那種蘆薈的那種面膜，應該可能之後會買這種。 | **Interviewee:** Hmm, a little bit, a little bit. Maybe I'll look for something more convenient, like something that doesn't require using a sheet mask, maybe just, hmm, how should I say... like, I've seen ones where you don't need to apply a sheet mask, it's like applying... applying that kind of aloe mask, maybe I'll buy that kind later. |
| **Me:** 嗯嗯嗯。好，那下面有一個部分可以按，妳覺得這個，這個是什麼意思？                                                                                    | **Me:** Mm-hmm mm-hmm. Okay, there's a section below you can press. What do you think this, this means?                                                                        |
| **Interviewee:** 積蓄 (註: TXT 誤聽為 金序) 嗎？嗯？假如說我不買這個東西啊，我可以存到多少錢嗎？                                                              | **Interviewee:** Savings (Note: TXT misheard as "Gold Order")? Hmm? Suppose if I don't buy this item, can I save some amount of money?                                     |
| **Me:** 好。那妳要先，呃，思考。                                                                                                                            | **Me:** Okay. Then you need to first, uh, think.                                                                                                                            |
| **Interviewee:** 在思考...妳要吃什麼？我沒有錢吃。 ...妳要給我錢，好嗎？                                                                                     | **Interviewee:** Thinking... What do you want to eat? I have no money to eat. ...You should give me money, okay?                                                               |
| **Interviewee:** 哦...哦！所以積蓄是那個碳排放量 (註: TXT 誤聽為 彈放量)，減少碳排放量？不會是錢？喔？然後說我不買那個面膜我可以...我可以省多少錢？喔，好貴。 | **Interviewee:** Oh... Oh! So savings means the carbon emissions (Note: TXT misheard as "bullet release amount"), reducing carbon emissions? Not money? Oh? And it says if I don't buy that mask I can... I can save how much money? Oh, so expensive. |
| **Me:** 所以中文來說，可能這個詞 (註: TXT 誤聽為 車) 不是最適合的。就是剛剛那個詞 (註: TXT 誤聽為 車)，因為妳剛剛是想...                                             | **Me:** So in Chinese, maybe this word (Note: TXT misheard as "car") isn't the most suitable. Just that word (Note: TXT misheard as "car") earlier, because you were thinking... |
| **Interviewee:** 賺錢？ (註: TXT 誤聽為 罐牛腱/罐牛肉)                                                                                                       | **Interviewee:** Making money? (Note: TXT misheard as "Canned beef tendon/Canned beef")                                                                                        |
| **Me:** 對。                                                                                                                                                | **Me:** Yes.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Interviewee:** 對對對，以為是不買這個東西，或者是可能，可能就是你買這個東西可以省多少錢，或是你不買這個東西可能會省多少錢。這個積蓄的話，我覺得...要怎麼看 (註: TXT 誤聽為 乾)？ | **Interviewee:** Right, right, right. I thought it was about not buying this thing, or maybe, maybe buying this thing could save how much money, or not buying this thing might save how much money. This "Savings", I feel... how should I look at it (Note: TXT misheard as "dry")? |
| **Me:** 好。那第三個部分，投資？                                                                                                                            | **Me:** Okay. Then the third section, Investment?                                                                                                                             |
| **Interviewee:** 投資嗎？投資喔？感覺很像是我要投資這一家的品牌？哪裡啊？投資這是...投資代號？美國、美國、韓國。感覺就是，對啊，就是投資這個品牌。                      | **Interviewee:** Investment? Investment, huh? Feels like I'm supposed to invest in this company's brand? Where? Investment this is... investment code? USA, USA, Korea. Feels like, yeah, investing in this brand. |
| **Me:** 那妳會嗎？                                                                                                                                          | **Me:** Would you?                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Interviewee:** 會。                                                                                                                                       | **Interviewee:** Yes.                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Me:** 好，那妳可以幫我回第一個部分嗎？第一個，買東西。然後下面下面下面...對，有兩個按鈕。如果妳不想要按也可以。                                               | **Me:** Okay, can you help me go back to the first section? The first one, buying things. Then below, below, below... Right, there are two buttons. If you don't want to press them, that's okay too. |
| **Interviewee:** 欸，等我看一下。哇哇哇，這個有點跑掉了。嗯...哇喔。我想一下...「對關心環保 (註: TXT 誤聽為 光環保) 的消費者來說，選擇可持續性的品牌可能會更好。以下是可替代的品牌，並附上簡單的比較表」。哦...這個，這個...那個，它可以再隔一個空位嗎？對，有點看不太懂。 | **Interviewee:** Hey, let me take a look. Wow wow wow, this one is a bit off. Hmm... Wow oh. Let me think... "For consumers concerned about environmental protection (Note: TXT misheard as "only environmental protection"), choosing sustainable brands might be better. Below are alternative brands with a simple comparison table attached." Oh... This, this... that, can it have another space? Right, it's a bit hard to understand. |
| **Me:** 好。好。那妳覺得...妳有另外一個按鈕 (註: TXT 誤聽為 案子)，妳想要問 (註: TXT 誤聽為 玩) AI嗎？                                                           | **Me:** Okay. Okay. So do you think... you have another button (Note: TXT misheard as "case"), do you want to ask (Note: TXT misheard as "play") the AI?             |
| **Interviewee:** AI嗎？隨便都可以。嗯...我想想看喔...「產品會浪費掉多少的碳排放量」？(註: TXT 誤聽為 網品櫃/癱瘓量) ...按到了。                                  | **Interviewee:** AI? Anything is fine. Hmm... Let me think... "How much carbon emission will the product waste?" (Note: TXT misheard as "Net product counter/paralysis amount") ...Pressed it. |
| **Me:** 欸，等一下，按到了。                                                                                                                                | **Me:** Hey, wait a minute, you pressed it.                                                                                                                                   |
| **Interviewee:** 我本來是要按說「會浪費掉多少的碳排放量」...                                                                                                   | **Interviewee:** I originally wanted to press "How much carbon emission will be wasted"...                                                                                  |
| **Me:** 哇，好清楚喔。                                                                                                                                      | **Me:** Wow, so clear.                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Me:** 好。那要說什麼？妳覺得最...重點是什麼？                                                                                                               | **Me:** Okay. What should I say? What do you think is the most... main point?                                                                                                 |
| **Interviewee:** 重點是什麼？蠻多的捏。就是光是從生產過程就已經開始產生碳排放，然後包裝本來就是也會產生，運輸過程也不用說就是本來就會產生的，只是我沒有想到說就是，最後的使用跟處理，使用過程中的水電消耗以及產品的包裝最終處理回收或掩埋，也會影響到碳排放。 | **Interviewee:** What's the main point? There's quite a lot. Just from the production process, carbon emissions already start being generated. Then packaging itself also generates them. The transportation process goes without saying, it inherently generates them. It's just that I didn't think about, like, the final use and disposal, the water and electricity consumption during use, and the final disposal of the product's packaging – recycling or landfill – would also affect carbon emissions. |
| **Me:** 嗯。好。那這樣就可以了。妳幫我拍照這個畫面 (註: TXT 誤聽為 玩意)，還有那個剛剛那個Momo...Momo，對。好，Momo，等一下...這個部分就可以了。好的。             | **Me:** Hmm. Okay. That's fine then. Help me take a photo of this screen (Note: TXT misheard as "thingy"), and also that Momo from just now... Momo, right. Okay, Momo, wait a moment... this part is fine. Okay. |
| **Interviewee:** 這上面有...                                                                                                                                | **Interviewee:** On top here there's...                                                                                                                                       |
