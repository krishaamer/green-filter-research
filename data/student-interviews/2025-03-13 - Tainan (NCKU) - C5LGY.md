| **Me:** 好，那我介紹一下，我是成功大學創意設計所 (註: JSON 誤聽為 轉一次說想)，然後這個是我的論文的一部分，一個環保的App。那你等一下會幫我測試 (註: JSON 誤聽為 介紹) 這個軟體嗎？ OK，好。那第一個問題是你平常會網路上買東西嗎？ (註: JSON 誤聽為 買到錢) | **Me:** Okay, let me introduce myself. I'm from the Institute of Creative Design at National Cheng Kung University (Note: JSON misheard as "turn once say think"), and this is part of my thesis, an environmental protection App. Will you help me test (Note: JSON misheard as "introduce") this software later? OK, good. So the first question is, do you usually buy things online? (Note: JSON misheard as "buy money") |
| **Interviewee:** 會。                                                                                                                       | **Interviewee:** Yes.                                                                                                                               |
| **Me:** 那你通常使用什麼平台？                                                                                                              | **Me:** What platforms do you usually use?                                                                                                          |
| **Interviewee:** 呃，旋轉或蝦皮。                                                                                                           | **Interviewee:** Uh, Carousell or Shopee.                                                                                                           |

| **Interviewee:** 有。                                                                                                                       | **Interviewee:** Yes.                                                                                                                               |
| **Me:** 那你當場 (註: 應為 通常) 會買什麼？                                                                                                  | **Me:** What do you usually (Note: "on the spot" likely misspoken/misheard, context suggests "usually") buy?                                        |
| **Interviewee:** Momo的話，通常會買一些3C用品或家電比較多。                                                                                 | **Interviewee:** On Momo, I usually buy more 3C products or home appliances.                                                                        |
| **Me:** 那其他的品牌呢？ (註: TXT 用 平颱)                                                                                                  | **Me:** What about other brands? (Note: TXT used "platforms")                                                                                       |
| **Interviewee:** 其他就是不一樣的，就是衣服或者之類的。                                                                                     | **Interviewee:** Others are different, like clothes or things like that.                                                                            |
| **Me:** 買這樣沒關。(註: 應為 日用品？) 是不是衣服或者日用品？好。那Momo上沒有衣服嗎？                                                       | **Me:** Buying like this doesn't matter. (Note: Likely meant "Daily necessities?") Are they clothes or daily necessities? Okay. Doesn't Momo have clothes? |
| **Interviewee:** 就是通常大家會覺得Momo上面的家電比較便宜，而且Momo的宅配選項就是比較多的感覺。                                              | **Interviewee:** It's just that people usually think home appliances on Momo are cheaper, and Momo's home delivery options feel more numerous.           |
| **Me:** 好，跟其他的比。那目前你有什麼想要買嗎？ (註: JSON/TXT 誤聽為 賣)                                                                     | **Me:** Okay, compared to others. Is there anything you want to buy right now? (Note: JSON/TXT misheard as "sell")                                     |
| **Interviewee:** 最近的話，嗯，應該是耳機吧。                                                                                               | **Interviewee:** Recently, um, probably headphones.                                                                                                 |
| **Me:** 好。那你，呃，可以幫我找一下你想要買的嗎？喔，我...注意一下...欸，找不到。你會打品牌嗎？因為我不知道他的那個在哪裡。                | **Me:** Okay. Uh, can you help me find what you want to buy? Oh, I... pay attention... Hey, can't find it. Would you type the brand? Because I don't know where it is. |
| **Interviewee:** (Searches)                                                                                                               | **Interviewee:** (Searches)                                                                                                                       |
| **Me:** 你要查什麼？                                                                                                                        | **Me:** What are you searching for?                                                                                                                 |
| **Interviewee:** 就是耳機。                                                                                                                 | **Interviewee:** Just headphones.                                                                                                                   |
| **Me:** 耳機，yeah。Mhm。那你想找什麼品牌嗎？                                                                                               | **Me:** Headphones, yeah. Mhm. Are you looking for a specific brand?                                                                                |
| **Interviewee:** 還是...我最近是看這個，Sony的。                                                                                            | **Interviewee:** Or... recently I've been looking at this one, Sony.                                                                                |
| **Me:** Sony的？那為什麼Sony？Sony的耳機？就是耳罩式的耳機？                                                                                  | **Me:** Sony? Why Sony? Sony headphones? The over-ear type?                                                                                         |
| **Interviewee:** 對。                                                                                                                       | **Interviewee:** Right.                                                                                                                             |
| **Me:** 好。那你為什麼要選 (註: JSON 誤聽為 幹嘛) 這個呢？這個品牌？                                                                        | **Me:** Okay. Why did you choose (Note: JSON misheard as "what for") this one? This brand?                                                          |
| **Interviewee:** 因為就是耳機的話其實很多選擇，可是我之前試過朋友的Sony的耳罩式，我覺得還蠻不錯的。就是它的那個戴起來... (註: JSON 誤聽為 代償人) 因為很多的耳機 (註: JSON 誤聽為 雞) 戴久了都會痛啊，但是這些...還沒有買 (註: JSON 誤聽為 賣) 過這個品牌。 | **Interviewee:** Because for headphones, there are actually many choices, but I tried a friend's Sony over-ear ones before, and I thought they were quite good. Just the way they feel when worn... (Note: JSON misheard "wearing comfort" as "compensation person") Because many headphones (Note: JSON misheard "headphones" as "chicken") hurt after wearing them for a long time, but these... I haven't bought (Note: JSON misheard as "sell") this brand before. |
| **Me:** 對。好。那，呃，你這個...這個網頁上，重要的地方在哪裡？                                                                              | **Me:** Right. Okay. Uh, on this... this webpage, where are the important parts?                                                                    |
| **Interviewee:** 最重要的地方？                                                                                                             | **Interviewee:** The most important parts?                                                                                                          |
| **Me:** 對。                                                                                                                                | **Me:** Yes.                                                                                                                                        |
| **Interviewee:** 就是如果是論一個商品的話，最重要的就是圖片跟價格嘛，然後還有品名這樣子，基本上就已經很夠了。                                | **Interviewee:** If we're talking about a product, the most important things are the picture and the price, right? And also the product name like that, basically that's enough. |
| **Me:** 好。那你覺得這裡還有什麼其他的新的嗎？你之前沒有看過嗎？這一塊？                                                                    | **Me:** Okay. Do you think there's anything else new here? Haven't you seen this part before? This section?                                         |
| **Interviewee:** 這塊...                                                                                                                    | **Interviewee:** This section...                                                                                                                    |
| **Me:** 好。那你覺得這一塊是什麼？                                                                                                          | **Me:** Okay. What do you think this section is?                                                                                                    |
| **Interviewee:** 這一塊，它是類似給你建議的嗎？或是...就是會給你一些資訊讓你參考。好。                                                    | **Interviewee:** This section, is it something like giving you suggestions? Or... it just gives you some information for reference. Okay.                 |
| **Me:** 然後就是它下面還有這種環保指數...                                                                                                   | **Me:** And then below it, there's this environmental index...                                                                                      |
| **Interviewee:** 應該會比較偏，就是會幫你看這個東西的個人環保，有沒有幫助。                                                                | **Interviewee:** It probably leans more towards, like, helping you see the personal environmental impact of this item, whether it's helpful.           |
| **Me:** 好。那買東西的時候呢，你會考慮它的環保嗎？                                                                                          | **Me:** Okay. When buying things, do you consider their environmental impact?                                                                       |
| **Interviewee:** 其實不太會。                                                                                                               | **Interviewee:** Actually, not really.                                                                                                              |
| **Me:** 好。那這個內容的重點在哪裡？                                                                                                        | **Me:** Okay. What is the main point of this content?                                                                                               |
| **Interviewee:** 就是它會給你參考它這個品牌的，然後這個東西的資訊，讓你了解。好。                                                            | **Interviewee:** It gives you information about this brand for reference, and information about this item, letting you understand. Okay.                |
| **Me:** 那我看完這個了，你可以找一些可能更好的替代品，不一定要馬上買，可以比較。好。那你幫我看到那個第二個部分，「儲蓄」，你覺得這個是什麼？ | **Me:** Now that I've read this, you can find some potentially better alternatives, you don't have to buy immediately, you can compare. Okay. Can you help me look at the second part, "Savings"? What do you think this is? |
| **Interviewee:** 儲蓄？嗯...儲蓄喔？他可能...看一下喔，就是他會，就是可能有一些品牌的小品...小品牌，碳排放會比較少嘛，如果是...就是比起大公司的。 | **Interviewee:** Savings? Um... Savings, huh? He might... let me see, it means he will, like, maybe some brands' small items... small brands, their carbon emissions might be lower, right? If it's... compared to big companies. |
| **Me:** 那再...現在其他的品牌你有買過還是看過嗎？                                                                                          | **Me:** Then again... have you bought or seen these other brands before?                                                                             |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯...沒有。                                                                                                                | **Interviewee:** Um... no.                                                                                                                          |
| **Me:** 好。那你覺得為什麼他會推薦這些品牌呢？                                                                                              | **Me:** Okay. Why do you think it recommends these brands?                                                                                          |
| **Interviewee:** 因為他的...他的解釋就是說這些要嘛就是，一開始的原料就比較環保，有些是可以用比較久，然後用比較久的話，它平均下來每天的...就是每天除下來的排放量 (註: TXT 誤聽為 配方量) 比較少。 | **Interviewee:** Because its... its explanation is that these are either, the raw materials are more environmentally friendly from the start, or some can be used longer, and if used longer, its average daily... the daily divided emissions (Note: TXT misheard as "formula amount") are lower. |
| **Me:** 好。那看到這些其他的品牌，你會考慮其他的嗎？                                                                                        | **Me:** Okay. Seeing these other brands, would you consider others?                                                                                 |
| **Interviewee:** 會。因為其實我對原料這種東西比較還好，可是如果我，如果知道這個東西，就是我有另外一個品牌比較耐用，可以用比較久，我可能就會想要參考一下。 | **Interviewee:** Yes. Because actually, I'm relatively indifferent to raw materials, but if I know this item, like, if I have another brand that's more durable and can be used longer, I might want to check it out for reference. |
| **Me:** 好。那因為這裡的氣壓不多啊 (註: JSON 誤聽，應為 資料不多啊)，你還是想要看什麼其他的嗎？你說什麼意思？就是這些品牌，其他的品牌，這裡有他的名詞而已，沒有很多。有什麼你比較想知道嗎？ | **Me:** Okay. Since the air pressure here isn't much (Note: JSON misheard, should be "data isn't much"), do you still want to see anything else? What do you mean? Like these brands, other brands, there are only their names here, not much else. Is there anything you particularly want to know? |
| **Interviewee:** 應該是這一個，就是耐用設計。                                                                                                | **Interviewee:** Probably this one, the durable design.                                                                                             |
| **Me:** 好，為什麼這個呢？                                                                                                                  | **Me:** Okay, why this one?                                                                                                                         |
| **Interviewee:** 因為如果我自己買東西的話，我會比較注重，我希望它可以永久很久 (註: 應為 用很久)...因為我買東西會憂鬱很久 (註: 應為 猶豫很久)，所以我會想說只要我這個東西我可以使用的很久的話就可以明確的麻煩 (註: 應為 買)。 OK。 | **Interviewee:** Because if I buy things myself, I pay more attention, I hope it can last forever for a long time (Note: Should be "be used for a long time")... Because I get depressed for a long time when buying things (Note: Should be "hesitate for a long time"), so I'd think as long as I can use this thing for a long time, then I can clearly trouble (Note: Should be "buy"). OK. |
| **Me:** 那你想要看的什麼圖片嗎？還是什麼其他的評論？還是...？                                                                                 | **Me:** Do you want to see any pictures? Or any other reviews? Or...?                                                                               |
| **Interviewee:** 目前沒...目前沒有。                                                                                                        | **Interviewee:** Not currently... currently no.                                                                                                     |
| **Me:** 好。那如果，如果我可以...因為現在什麼都沒有，那如果有什麼其他的氣調 (註: JSON 誤聽，應為 資料)，你讓...你要看什麼 (註: JSON 誤聽 場嗎)？它的評論還是照片還是價格還是...？ | **Me:** Okay. What if, what if I could... Because there's nothing now, but if there was some other air conditioning (Note: JSON misheard, should be "data"), you let... what do you want to see (Note: JSON misheard "place")? Its reviews or photos or price or...? |
| **Interviewee:** 如果是這邊要再加一點東西的話，我希望我可以看到價格跟，就是可能跟這個牌子的比較。因為就是我看到這些，可是我可能不太確定那我原本的是多少，或是我不是這邊推薦的，他可能不一定是一定一樣的東西啊。 | **Interviewee:** If something were to be added here, I hope I could see the price and, like, maybe a comparison with this brand. Because I see these, but I might not be sure how much my original one was, or maybe it's not the one recommended here, it might not necessarily be the exact same thing. |
| **Me:** 嗯。對。然後我也想要看說，就是比價這樣子。嗯。還是另外一個想法是，你也可以...那個通常人會使用這個產品多久？ 對。                           | **Me:** Mhm. Right. And I also want to see, like, price comparison. Mhm. Or another idea is, you could also... how long do people typically use this product? Right. |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯。這個我覺得平常大家會使用多久感覺就比較難，就是比較難就是短時間研究出來吧，因為他假設這個產品剛出，他們也要一段時間才會知道說這個東西可以用多久。 | **Interviewee:** Um. This one, I think how long everyone usually uses it feels harder, it's harder to research in a short time, right? Because assuming this product just came out, they also need some time to know how long this thing can be used. |
| **Me:** 好。來可以嗎？你幫我看到你的第三個部分，你覺得這個是什麼？                                                                          | **Me:** Okay. Come on, can you? Help me look at your third part, what do you think this is?                                                          |
| **Interviewee:** 哦，是原本公司的股票嗎？嗯。哦，所以我到時候開的話還可以看到它這個公司的最近的市場發展？                                      | **Interviewee:** Oh, is it the original company's stock? Um. Oh, so if I open it then, I can still see this company's recent market development?           |
| **Me:** 對。那你，你趁現有要投資過嗎？ (註: JSON 誤聽 你趁現有要透直播嗎)                                                                     | **Me:** Right. Have you, have you taken the opportunity to invest before? (Note: JSON misheard "Have you taken the opportunity to live stream now?")   |
| **Interviewee:** 有，那種就是模擬投資啊。實際上的沒有。                                                                                      | **Interviewee:** Yes, the kind that's simulated investing. Not actual investing.                                                                    |
| **Me:** 好。那你現在買 (註: JSON/TXT 誤聽為 賣) 東西跟投資 (註: JSON 誤聽為 透抽) 有什麼關係嗎？還是從完全不一樣的？                       | **Me:** Okay. Does buying (Note: JSON/TXT misheard as "selling") things now have any relation to investing (Note: JSON misheard as "cuttlefish")? Or are they completely different? |
| **Interviewee:** 就是，雖然說實際在投資的時候，你不會覺得說一般人買東西對這個，這個的波動有沒有那麼的明顯，就是我買不買其實對現在的股票其實不會差太多。但是假設每個人都，就是他可能這間，這間公司可能最近有什麼比較，比如說新品上市，或是出現什麼，就是比如說，呃，影響品牌的信譽的東西，那可能他的股票就會跌。我覺得那種比較重要。就是一般的消費的話可能比較還好。 | **Interviewee:** Well, although when actually investing, you wouldn't feel that ordinary people buying things has such an obvious effect on the fluctuations of this, this stock. Like, whether I buy or not doesn't really make much difference to the current stock price. But suppose everyone, like, maybe this, this company recently had something major, like a new product launch, or something happened, like, uh, something affecting the brand's reputation, then maybe its stock price will fall. I think that kind of thing is more important. Regular consumption might be less significant. |
| **Me:** 可是品牌的信譽會影響人要不要消費。嗯。那如果你很喜歡這個，這個品牌，你會比較考慮買這個，這個股票嗎？                                   | **Me:** But brand reputation affects whether people want to consume. Um. So if you really like this, this brand, would you be more likely to consider buying this, this stock? |
| **Interviewee:** 其實如果，如果我喜歡這個品牌是因為它的產品的話，可能會。因為就是假設這個產品真的好用的話，就會讓可能這個東西就會比較暢銷。可是我可能主要還是會比較care說這個品牌的發展性如何，因為像Sony已經上市很久了。然後我可能就是，就算我很喜歡，也是要看時間才可以去買，不一定說我很希望 (註: JSON 誤聽) 我就可以買。 | **Interviewee:** Actually, if, if I like this brand because of its products, maybe. Because if this product is really good, it might make this thing sell better. But I might still mainly care more about the brand's development potential, because like Sony has been listed for a long time. And I might just, even if I like it a lot, I still need to consider the timing to buy, it's not necessarily that just because I really want (Note: JSON misheard "like" as "hope") it, I can buy it. |
| **Me:** 嗯。對啦。那它，它這裡跟你講的那個啊 (註: 應為 內容)，重點在哪裡？                                                                     | **Me:** Um. Right. So, what it, what it tells you here (Note: "ah" likely filler, meant "content"), where is the main point?                             |
| **Interviewee:** 他會先跟你說就是最近他的近期的股票趨勢，那我就可以看出來它最近就是雖然前陣子有點跌 (註: JSON 誤聽)，但是最近有在慢慢的上升。然後呢再來就是他會說他的，就是這些這個品牌對對環保的領域做了什麼事情，然後什麼事情沒有做，這樣子。 | **Interviewee:** It first tells you its recent stock trend. Then I can see that recently, although it dipped (Note: JSON misheard "dipped" as "a bit") a while ago, it has been slowly rising recently. And then next, it will talk about its, like what this brand has done in the field of environmental protection, and what it hasn't done, like that. |
| **Me:** 好。那，呃，可以幫我回那個第一個部分那個嗎？                                                                                          | **Me:** Okay. Uh, can you help me go back to that first part?                                                                                       |
| **Interviewee:** 對。                                                                                                                       | **Interviewee:** Right.                                                                                                                             |
| **Me:** 那最下面有兩個按鈕，你想要按哪個嗎？                                                                                                | **Me:** At the very bottom, there are two buttons. Which one do you want to press?                                                                  |
| **Interviewee:** 呃，這個。因為產地我應該會知道。                                                                                            | **Interviewee:** Uh, this one. Because I probably know the place of origin.                                                                         |
| **Me:** 好。那為什麼你要這個呢？                                                                                                            | **Me:** Okay. Why do you want this one?                                                                                                             |
| **Interviewee:** 因為就是買東西的話，你一定要比較說會不會有比這個更好的商品。因為產地的話其實你自己如果這是一個大牌子或什麼的，你其實可以猜到說他產地是哪一天 (註: 應為 哪裡)。嗯。對。所以我可能會比較想要知道說其他品牌在這方面做得怎麼樣。 | **Interviewee:** Because when buying things, you definitely need to compare if there are better products than this one. Because for the place of origin, if it's a big brand or something, you can actually guess where its place of origin is (Note: "which day" misspoken/misheard, meant "where"). Um. Right. So I might be more interested in knowing how other brands are doing in this aspect. |
| **Me:** 好。那這個，剛剛打...它給你講的內容裡面有什麼重要的嗎？                                                                                | **Me:** Okay. This one, just typed... is there anything important in the content it gave you?                                                        |
| **Interviewee:** 我看一下喔。就是他會，他因為他這裡的那個，他這裡舉例的就跟...就會牌子就會比較大，然後我就可以看說這三個，這三個關於環保的，關於環保或是人權管理的部分做了什麼事情。然後這些品牌會比較像是，一般人會參考的。因為剛剛那些就是說碳排放量很低的，可能平常我們要買的時候我們不會想到，但是我們想到這些，然後我們可以之間 (註: 應為 直接) 比較的話其實還不錯。而且他最後也會幫我們統整說誰跟誰在評分上面比較好，然後就是會變成更好的選擇。 | **Interviewee:** Let me see. It will, because here, the examples it gives are like... the brands will be bigger, and then I can see these three, what these three have done regarding environmental protection, or human rights management. And these brands are more like what ordinary people would refer to. Because those ones just now that said low carbon emissions, maybe we wouldn't think of them when we usually buy, but we think of these, and if we can compare between (Note: "between" likely misspoken, meant "directly") them, it's actually quite good. And finally, it also helps us summarize who compares better with whom in terms of rating, and then it becomes a better choice. |
| **Me:** 那你有什麼其他的問題你想要問他嗎？也可以做其他測試。                                                                                | **Me:** Do you have any other questions you want to ask it? You can also do other tests.                                                            |
| **Interviewee:** 那個這題大車 (註: JSON 誤聽，應為 替代產品)                                                                                 | **Interviewee:** That question, big car (Note: JSON misheard, likely meant "alternative products" based on button function)                           |
| **Me:** 好。你可以幫我講出來嗎？要去上面。                                                                                                  | **Me:** Okay. Can you say it out loud for me? Need to go up.                                                                                        |
| **Interviewee:** 就是檢查一個產品的可課 (註: 應為 可持續性)...就是不管是買自己買東西或是買家用品，就是一個東西，可持續性。就是，我覺得就是之前會有人說你的消費決定你的生活，就是你要像是比如說像我可能不喜歡就是之前會有一些那種剝削的，使用剝削的棉花的品牌，我可能就不會消費。就是我覺得說聯合抵制或是什麼，這件事情是對公司會有壓力的。那假設我在環保這部分上，然後大家也許注意到這件事情去相對的比較少買，對品牌，對品牌也是硬傷 (註: 應為 影響)。然後品牌就會想，就是知道這件事情，然後來改善這個狀況。 | **Interviewee:** Just checking a product's class class (Note: Should be "sustainability")... It's like whether buying things for myself or buying household goods, just one thing, sustainability. It's like, I feel like someone said before, "Your consumption determines your world." It's like you need to, for example, like maybe I don't like brands that previously used exploitative, exploited cotton, I might not consume them. It's just, I feel that boycotting together or something, this matter puts pressure on the company. So suppose in the environmental aspect, and maybe everyone notices this matter and relatively buys less, for the brand, for the brand it's also a hard injury (Note: Should be "impact").
