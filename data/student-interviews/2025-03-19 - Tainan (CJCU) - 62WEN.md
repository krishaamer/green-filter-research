| **Interviewee:** 呃...我覺得可能制定購物清單，就是...我有時候會看一看，然後就很想要，但是其實也不是那麼想要，就是腦波太弱了，看到廣告很吸引人就想要買。那制定購物清單就可以讓我三思而後行。                                                                                                                      | **Interviewee:** Uh... I think maybe making a shopping list, because... sometimes I look around, and then I really want something, but actually I don't want it that much, just my brain waves are too weak, I see an attractive ad and want to buy. So making a shopping list can make me think twice before acting. |

| **Interviewee:** (Looks) 推薦投資他嗎？可是他不是不好嗎？所以我應該不會想投資他。                                                                                                                                                         | **Interviewee:** (Looks) Recommend investing in it? But isn't it bad? So I probably wouldn't want to invest in it.                                                                                                                               |
| **Interviewer:** 所以你覺得賣東西跟投資有什麼關係嗎？還是是完全不一樣的？                                                                                                                                                               | **Interviewer:** So do you think selling things and investing have any relationship? Or are they completely different?                                                                                                                           |
| **Interviewee:** 會有關係。就是...應該說投資會...就是等於是給那間公司更多的支持，不是嗎？對我來說解釋是這樣子。                                                                                                                                | **Interviewee:** There would be a relationship. Just... should say investing would... just means giving that company more support, doesn't it? To me, the explanation is like that.                                                                |
| **Interviewer:** 所以如果今天那個公司，它是不優的，那它當然就不要去投資它了。                                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewer:** So if today that company, it's not good, then of course one shouldn't invest in it.                                                                                                                                           |
| **Interviewee:** 所以如果它的商品很好，你比較會想要投資嗎？                                                                                                                                                                            | **Interviewee:** So if its products are very good, you'd be more inclined to invest?                                                                                                                                                            |
