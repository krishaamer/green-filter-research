| **Interviewee:** 推薦投資他嗎？可是他不是不好嗎？所以我應該不會想投資他。                                                                                                                                                                 | **Interviewee:** Recommend investing in it? But isn't it bad? So I probably wouldn't want to invest in it.                                                                                                                                      |
| **Interviewer:** 所以你覺得賣東西跟投資有什麼關係嗎？還是是完全不一樣的？                                                                                                                                                               | **Interviewer:** So do you think selling things and investing have any relationship? Or are they completely different?                                                                                                                           |
| **Interviewee:** 會有關係。就是...應該說投資會...就是等於是給那間公司更多的支持，不是嗎？對我來說解釋是這樣子。                                                                                                                                | **Interviewee:** There would be a relationship. Just... should say investing would... just means giving that company more support, doesn't it? To me, the explanation is like that.                                                                |
| **Interviewer:** 所以如果今天那個公司，它是...                                                                                                                                                                                     | **Interviewer:** So if today that company, it is...                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Interviewee:** 不優的，那它當然就不要去投資它了。                                                                                                                                                                                | **Interviewee:** ...not good, then of course one shouldn't invest in it.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Interviewer:** 所以如果它的商品很好，你比較會想要投資嗎？                                                                                                                                                                            | **Interviewer:** So if its products are very good, you'd be more inclined to invest?                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Interviewee:** 對對對。哦...就是支持他們。對，支持他們。對對對。                                                                                                                                                                       | **Interviewee:** Yes yes yes.
