| **Interviewee:** 嗯，什麼都可以。                                                                                                                                                                                                | **Interviewee:** Um, anything is fine.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Interviewer:** 就是網頁上，呃，有很多，不是有很多資料嗎？你覺得哪裡是比較重要？                                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewer:** Like on the webpage, uh, there's a lot, isn't there a lot of information? Where do you think is more important?                                                                                                                |
| **Interviewee:** 就是這個本身產品的畫面，跟價格有寫清楚。                                                                                                                                                                           | **Interviewee:** Just the image of the product itself, and that the price is clearly written.                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Interviewer:** 價格，還有價格。那評論呢？                                                                                                                                                                                        | **Interviewer:** Price, and price. What about reviews?                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Interviewee:** 評論的話，我覺得...我覺得 momo 的評論我會比較...可能我沒有很常用 momo，所以我沒有很知道，就是它的評論好像都會想要可以往下滑就找到。                                                                                                                                 | **Interviewee:** For reviews, I think... I think momo's reviews I would more... maybe because I don't use momo very often, so I don't really know, it seems like its reviews, you'd want to be able to just scroll down and find them.               |
| **Interviewer:** 嗯。那是不太會看評論？                                                                                                                                                                                            | **Interviewer:** Um. So you don't really look at reviews much?                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Interviewee:** 評論的話嗎？會看會看，會希望有實體的圖片，就是別人購買後，就是買家購買後的那個實體的，實體的樣品這樣。                                                                                                                                           | **Interviewee:** Reviews? I do look, I do look. I hope there are real photos, like after someone else buys it, the buyer's actual, actual sample photos like that.                                                                           |
| **Interviewer:** 那評論的話，你是比較相信那個 momo 上的評論，還是在其他的平台上的評論？                                                                                                                                                          | **Interviewer:** For reviews, do you trust the reviews on momo more, or reviews on other platforms?                                                                                                                                              |
| **Interviewee:** 比起蝦皮那些嘛，我覺得會比較相信 momo。                                                                                                                                                                             | **Interviewee:** Compared to Shopee and those, I think I trust momo more.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Interviewer:** 哦，為什麼呢？                                                                                                                                                                                                | **Interviewer:** Oh, why is that?                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Interviewee:** 因為...呃...蝦皮感覺有很...比較方便，就是買家的...呃...賣家的身份確認上好像比 momo 的還容易一些，所以比較容易買到就是比較...呃...不符合圖片的一些商品的感覺。好好。                                                                                                                       | **Interviewee:** Because... uh... Shopee feels very... convenient, meaning the buyer's... uh... the seller's identity verification seems easier than momo's, so it's easier to buy things that are more... uh... don't match the pictures. Okay okay. |
| **Interviewer:** 你可以幫我...去上面？好。剛剛那個右邊有一個黃色的地方？黃色的部分。這個。好。你覺得這個是什麼？                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewer:** Can you help me... go up? Okay. Just now on the right side, there was a yellow area? The yellow part. This one. Okay. What do you think this is?                                                                                |
| **Interviewee:** 這個是...呃...就是關於產品的一些資料，跟品牌的資料跟內容嘛。                                                                                                                                                            | **Interviewee:** This is... uh... just some information about the product, and the brand's information and content.                                                                                                                             |
| **Interviewer:** 那你覺得他講的，呃，有什麼重要的嗎？                                                                                                                                                                               | **Interviewer:** Do you think what it says, uh, is important in any way?                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Interviewee:** 你說這有什麼重要的嗎？嗯...了解一個產品本身的品牌能夠讓我們更知道這個產品本身對我們的效果是不是好的，然後是不是我們想要買到的材質，跟品牌本身給的信用也會比較有保障的感覺，會比較願意下單。                                                                                                            | **Interviewee:** You mean is this important? Um... Understanding the brand of a product itself allows us to know better if the product itself will be effective for us, and if it's the material we want to buy. And the credit given by the brand itself also feels more guaranteed, making one more willing to place an order. |
| **Interviewer:** 嗯。那你會覺得這個內容是關於這個產品嗎？                                                                                                                                                                             | **Interviewer:** Um. Do you feel this content is about this product?                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Interviewee:** 對對。                                                                                                                                                                                                        | **Interviewee:** Yes, yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Interviewer:** 那跟這個產品有關係嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                            | **Interviewer:** Is it related to this product?                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Interviewee:** 跟這個產品有關係嗎？有。因為他有講到蠻多關於產品本身的，就是製造的...呃...國家，然後還有用的材料。我覺得是會想要...呃...買家買東西之前會想要先知道是哪裡出產的。                                                                                                                             | **Interviewee:** Related to this product? Yes. Because it mentioned quite a bit about the product itself, like the manufacturing... uh... country, and also the materials used. I think buyers would want to know where it's produced before buying. |
| **Interviewer:** 好，OK。那你可以幫我看第二個部分嗎？                                                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewer:** Okay, OK. Can you look at the second section for me?                                                                                                                                                                          |

Um.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Interviewer:** 有看到嗎？第...這個嗎？呃，上面一點。你看，你有發現有...有三個部分嗎？                                                                                                                                                           | **Interviewer:** Did you see it? The... this one? Uh, a bit higher. Look, did you notice there are... three sections?                                                                                                                           |
| **Interviewee:** 有。                                                                                                                                                                                                          | **Interviewee:** Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Interviewer:** 好。這個是什麼？                                                                                                                                                                                                | **Interviewer:** Okay. What is this?                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Interviewee:** 哦...問你幹嘛來著？就是...呃...就是這個東西本身，產品對於環境的影響，就是有沒有環保的效果嘛。                                                                                                                                       | **Interviewee:** Oh... what was I asking you? It's... uh... just this thing itself, the product's impact on the environment, like whether it has environmental effects.                                                                           |
| **Interviewer:** 嗯。哦。那這些其他的品牌你有看過嗎？                                                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewer:** Um. Oh. Have you seen these other brands before?                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Interviewee:** 你說...嗯...好像有聽過這個。哦，但沒有很熟。                                                                                                                                                                           | **Interviewee:** You mean... um... I think I've heard of this one. Oh, but not familiar.                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Interviewer:** 那是你覺得它是做安全帽的嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                      | **Interviewer:** Do you think it makes helmets?                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Interviewee:** 感覺不只會有安全帽，感覺會跟很多其他我沒有想像得到，但好像不會只是安全帽的品牌，聽起來也不像。                                                                                                                                      | **Interviewee:** Feels like it's not just helmets, feels like it's related to many other things I wouldn't have imagined, but it seems like it wouldn't just be a helmet brand, doesn't sound like it either.                                          |
| **Interviewer:** 那你是覺得是真的還是假的呢？                                                                                                                                                                                      | **Interviewer:** Do you think it's real or fake?                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Interviewee:** 你說這邊的品牌資訊嗎？我會相信是真的。                                                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewee:** You mean the brand information here? I would believe it's real.                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Interviewer:** 好。那第三個部分呢？那我還是問你，為什麼你覺得是真的？                                                                                                                                                                    | **Interviewer:** Okay. What about the third section? Then let me ask again, why do you think it's real?                                                                                                                                        |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯...因為覺得他寫得算蠻清楚的，然後也不只提供一個品牌，是提供了不同品牌來做比較，然後也有解釋到原因，所以我會覺得是真的，會相信看看。                                                                                                                            | **Interviewee:** Um... because I feel it's written quite clearly, and it doesn't just provide one brand, it provides different brands for comparison, and also explains the reasons, so I would feel it's real, I would believe it and take a look. |
| **Interviewer:** 好，OK。那第三個部分是什麼？                                                                                                                                                                                     | **Interviewer:** Okay, OK. What is the third section?                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Interviewee:** 第三個部分是投資。                                                                                                                                                                                                | **Interviewee:** The third section is investment.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Interviewer:** 投資，好。那你之前有投資過嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                    | **Interviewer:** Investment, okay. Have you invested before?                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Interviewee:** 沒有。                                                                                                                                                                                                        | **Interviewee:** No.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Interviewer:** 那你覺得如果你喜歡一個產品，那你想要投資那個公司嗎？                                                                                                                                                                    | **Interviewer:** Do you think if you like a product, would you want to invest in that company?                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Interviewee:** 你說喜歡這個產品的話，會想要投資這個公司嗎？目前的話會沒有想。嗯...如果年紀可能再一兩年可能會想到。                                                                                                                                  | **Interviewee:** You mean if I like this product, would I want to invest in this company? Right now, I wouldn't think so. Um... if maybe in another year or two, I might think about it.                                                         |
| **Interviewer:** 那我的意思是，賣東西跟投資有什麼關係嗎？還是是完全不一樣的？                                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewer:** What I mean is, is there any relationship between selling things and investing? Or are they completely different?                                                                                                                |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯...我覺得是完全不一樣的。                                                                                                                                                                                       | **Interviewee:** Um... I think they are completely different.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Interviewer:** OK。好。那你幫我回那個第一個部分喔。                                                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewer:** OK.
