| **Interviewee:** 是告訴你說這個...可能它的材質不好，那你可能不清楚，但這裡寫得很清楚。                                                                        | **Interviewee:** It tells you that this... maybe its material is not good, and you might not know clearly, but it's written very clearly here.                                         |
| **Me:** 嗯。那你看到這個的之後 (註: JSON 誤聽為 的車好)，還是想要買這個產品嗎？                                                                              | **Me:** Hmm. After seeing this (Note: JSON misheard as "this car good"), do you still want to buy this product?                                                                        |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯...他有說到環保的部分嗎？就是說這個是聚酯纖維？                                                                                             | **Interviewee:** Hmm... Did it mention the environmental protection part? Like saying this is polyester fiber?                                                                          |
| **Me:** 他說什麼聚酯纖維好像不是環保的材質。好。這裡有說。                                                                                                  | **Me:** What polyester fiber it says seems not to be an environmentally friendly material. Okay. It says here.                                                                        |
| **Interviewee:** 就是有提醒你說這個東西聚酯纖維還有什麼？這個是化學汙染？好，那我覺得我會再慎重考慮一下。就是因為我買東西本來就不是我看到然後馬上會買，我會想很久。好。那這個給我一個，多一個參考的。 | **Interviewee:** It reminds you that this thing, polyester fiber, and what else? This is chemical pollution? Okay, then I think I will reconsider carefully. Because when I buy things, I don't just buy immediately upon seeing them, I think for a long time. Okay. Then this gives me one, one more reference. |
| **Me:** 啊，上面還有兩個按鈕。                                                                                                                              | **Me:** Ah, there are two more buttons above.                                                                                                                                         |
| **Interviewee:** （點擊按鈕）這個是什麼？                                                                                                                     | **Interviewee:** (Clicks button) What is this?                                                                                                                                        |

| **Interviewee:** 就說如果你不買這個嘛？是這樣的意思？就是說這個東西所會製造的碳排放量。這些會製造地球的...                                                     | **Interviewee:** Meaning if you don't buy this? Is that the meaning? Meaning the carbon emissions this thing will produce. These will produce the Earth's...                             |
| **Me:** 對，這是它的數值嗎？嗯。                                                                                                                            | **Me:** Right, is this its numerical value? Hmm.                                                                                                                                      |
| **Interviewee:** 那這些其他的品牌你有買過 (註: JSON 誤聽為 賣光) 嗎？還是有聽聽過說嘛？                                                                       | **Interviewee:** Then these other brands, have you bought (Note: JSON misheard as "sold out") them? Or have you heard of them?                                                          |
| **Me:** 呃...聽說過。呃...這是什麼？嗯...我以為我英文不好。這個是什麼？Patagonia？                                                                           | **Me:** Uh... heard of them. Uh... What's this? Hmm... I thought my English was bad. What's this? Patagonia?                                                                        |
| **Interviewee:** Patagonia是什麼？我好像沒有，沒有注意那個。                                                                                                  | **Interviewee:** What is Patagonia? I don't seem to have, haven't noticed that one.                                                                                                     |

| **Me:** 好。那最後一個部分呢？這是什麼？                                                                                                                    | **Me:** Okay. What about the last section? What is this?                                                                                                                              |
| **Interviewee:** 最終你買過其他產品的公司？就是說這個？這個是指什麼？我這個有點不懂。                                                                        | **Interviewee:** Finally, the company whose other products you've bought? Meaning this? What does this refer to? I don't quite understand this one.                                     |
| **Me:** 好啊，沒問題。嗯。所以下面還有兩個按鈕，你想要按一個互相聊也可以。                                                                                    | **Me:** Okay, no problem. Hmm. So below there are still two buttons, do you want to press one to chat with each other, that's also okay.                                             |
| **Interviewee:** 我試試看看。                                                                                                                                 | **Interviewee:** Let me try and see.                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Me:** (Participant clicks button) 還有什麼？                                                                                                              | **Me:** (Participant clicks button) What else?                                                                                                                                        |
| **Interviewee:** 「持續」...哦，它給你其他替代的品牌。然後告訴你說這些品牌是比較有，有對環保有幫助的啊。那這個是一個AI幫手，也可以自己問問題。                  | **Interviewee:** "Sustainable"... Oh, it gives you other alternative brands. Then tells you these brands are more, have, are helpful to environmental protection. Ah. Then this is an AI assistant, you can also ask questions yourself. |
| **Me:** 嗯。那有什麼問題想要問嗎？                                                                                                                          | **Me:** Hmm. Do you have any questions you want to ask?                                                                                                                               |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯...沒有。                                                                                                                                  | **Interviewee:** Hmm... No.                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Me:** 想？也可以自己打字 (註: JSON 誤聽為 搭車)。                                                                                                         | **Me:** Think? You can also type yourself (Note: JSON misheard as "take car").                                                                                                        |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯。但我，我想問就是那個品牌...就是它跳出來的那幾個，它推薦的。但是會不會就是，就是變成只固定那幾個品牌？就是畢竟我覺得在做環保的品牌線現在有越來越多，但是還是比較是少數啊。那這樣子會不會就是每次我只要搜尋 (註: TXT 誤聽為 取) 什麼，然後跳出來的都是一樣的，一樣的？會有這個問題喔。 | **Interviewee:** Hmm. But I, I want to ask about that brand... like those few that popped up, the ones it recommended. But will it, will it become fixed to only those few brands? Because after all, I feel that the line of environmentally friendly brands is increasing now, but it's still relatively a minority. Ah. Then in that case, will it be that every time I just search (Note: TXT misheard as "take") for something, the ones that pop up are all the same, the same? There might be this issue. |
| **Me:** 好。                                                                                                                                                | **Me:** Okay.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Me:** 好。那這樣就可以了。手機，你可以使用你的手機掃描這個QR。那下面有一個問卷。那這個測試代碼要就是這些，所以如果你測試一個產品就可以了。但是你因為你測試三個產品，可以寫三個。好。好。謝謝。 | **Me:** Okay. That's fine then. Phone, you can use your phone to scan this QR. Then below there's a questionnaire. And this test code is just these, so if you tested one product, that's fine. But since you tested three products, you can write three. Okay. Okay. Thank you. |
| **Me:** 呃，那你可（以）幫我簽名 (註: JSON 誤聽為 其實) 那個卡片上？寫這個號碼？                                                                              | **Me:** Uh, then can you help me sign (Note: JSON misheard as "actually") that card?
