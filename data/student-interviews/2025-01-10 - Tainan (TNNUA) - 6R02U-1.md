| **Me:** 我先介紹 (註: JSON 誤聽為 牽車身) 一下，所以基本上這個是 (註: JSON 誤聽為 誰利率) 我的論文的一部分，環保軟體。那我們等下 (註: JSON 誤聽為 在下) 會測試這個 (註: TXT 誤聽為 是是) App。我可以錄你的聲音嗎？ | **Me:** Let me introduce (Note: JSON misheard as "pull car body") first. So basically this is (Note: JSON misheard as "whose interest rate") part of my thesis, an environmental protection software.

Then uh, this just happens, on this webpage, there is, there is, there is... do you think there's any important information? Important? Important? You think it's OK? This is very important? Know it?

| **Interviewee:** 可能，你說這個東西為什麼很重要嗎？                                                                                                          | **Interviewee:** Maybe, are you asking why this thing is very important?                                                                                                              |
| **Me:** 不是，我是說那個剛剛不是有很多資料嗎？所以就要寫很多資料。然後首先你會看什麼？可能不知道價格還是看顏色還是看什麼？                                        | **Me:** No, I mean, wasn't there a lot of information just now? So you need to write a lot of information. Then what would you look at first? Maybe you don't know the price, or look at the color, or look at what? |
| **Interviewee:** 可能看...可能看好不好看。                                                                                                                   | **Interviewee:** Maybe look... maybe look if it looks good.                                                                                                                           |

| **Me:** 好。那剛剛旁邊有，可能換色的部分，那個換色的部分裡面，可以幫我看一下到底你想什麼？                                                                     | **Me:** Okay. Then beside it just now, maybe the color-changing part, inside that color-changing part, can you help me see what exactly you're thinking?                      |
| **Interviewee:** （查看插件）好像都不知道這個品牌。對，他是說這個什麼，CTSTAR是屬於消費品牌，中型企業，然後沒有，沒有看過很大的環保整理。然後這個產品是用塑膠做的，對環境會有影響。CEO不詳。 | **Interviewee:** (Looking at plugin) Seems like I don't know this brand at all. Right, it says this what, CTSTAR belongs to consumer brands, a medium-sized enterprise, and then no, haven't seen major environmental consolidation. Then this product is made of plastic, will have an impact on the environment. CEO unknown. |
