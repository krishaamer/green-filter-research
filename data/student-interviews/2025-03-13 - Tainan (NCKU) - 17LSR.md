| **Interviewee:** 第三個我想看喔...它的功能介紹這些。                                                                                                          | **Interviewee:** The third, let me see... its feature descriptions, these things.                                                                                       |
| **Me:** 好。那價格呢？然後還是評論？還是其他的？喔，第一個重要的是價格啊。對的。那評論呢？                                                                    | **Me:** Okay. What about the price? Then reviews? Or others? Oh, the first important thing is the price. Right. What about reviews?                         |
| **Interviewee:** 評論喔？對，評論也是很重要的。OK。喔對，抱歉。那應該要改成第一個是...對我來說第一個重要的是價格，嗯，然後第二個是圖片，第三個我就會看評論了。 | **Interviewee:** Reviews? Oh yes, reviews are also very important. OK. Oh right, sorry. Then it should be changed to the first... for me, the first important thing is price, hmm, then the second is pictures, and the third I would look at reviews. |
| **Me:** 好啊。那剛剛那個旁邊右邊有一個黃色 (註: TXT 誤聽為 換色) 的部分，妳覺得這個是什麼？                                                                 | **Me:** Okay. Just now, on the right side, there was a yellow (Note: TXT misheard as "color changing") section, what do you think that is?                  |
| **Interviewee:** 這個是聊天視窗嗎？這是什麼？喔，這是你做的喔？它是可以幫妳分析喔...ESG相關的東西？                                                        | **Interviewee:** Is this a chat window? What is this? Oh, you made this? It can help analyze... ESG-related things?                                        |
| **Me:** 那妳覺得這裡的重點在哪裡？                                                                                                                          | **Me:** What do you think is the main point here?                                                                                                                     |
| **Interviewee:** 這裡的重點是...這邊的重點是它會分析，呃，這個產品的環保...類似環保指數嗎？就是他們對於環保的部分有貢獻，或者是它是傷害環境的，這樣子。                 | **Interviewee:** The main point here is... the point here is that it analyzes, uh, the environmental protection of this product... like an environmental index? Meaning whether they contribute to environmental protection, or if it harms the environment, like that. |
| **Me:** 好。那妳會擔心這個嗎？                                                                                                                              | **Me:** Okay. Would you worry about this?                                                                                                                             |
| **Interviewee:** 有，我會，我會，我會在乎這個。                                                                                                               | **Interviewee:** Yes, I would, I would, I would care about this.                                                                                                      |
| **Me:** 那這個內容的裡面，最重要的部分在哪裡？                                                                                                              | **Me:** Within this content, what is the most important part?                                                                                                         |
| **Interviewee:** 應該是這個吧...「雖然Dior (註: TXT 誤聽為 dial) 有使用可持續材料的承諾，但ESG評分仍偏低」這樣。                                                | **Interviewee:** Probably this one... "Although Dior (Note: TXT misheard as dial) has committed to using sustainable materials, its ESG rating remains low," like that. |
| **Me:** 為什麼這個重要？                                                                                                                                    | **Me:** Why is this important?                                                                                                                                        |
| **Interviewee:** 因為就是，嗯，就是有它好的部分嘛，跟不太好的結果，這樣子。嗯。                                                                               | **Interviewee:** Because, well, hmm, it has its good parts, right, and the not-so-good results, like that. Hmm.                                                 |
| **Me:** 好。那妳可以幫我開那個第二個部分嗎？第二個部分，妳覺得這個是什麼？                                                                                  | **Me:** Okay. Can you open the second section for me? The second section, what do you think this is?                                                                |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯...這個是，喔，它會告訴我，呃，如果我不買的話，就可以類似保護環境多少的那種感覺，或者是會有怎麼樣的影響，這樣。                               | **Interviewee:** Hmm... This is, oh, it tells me, uh, if I don't buy it, it's like a feeling of protecting the environment to some extent, or what kind of impact it would have, like that. |
| **Me:** 那下面這些是什麼？                                                                                                                                  | **Me:** What are these below?                                                                                                                                         |
| **Interviewee:** 那一些比起這個牌子，然後對於環保更重要...更有致力於環保的品牌。嗯。                                                                        | **Interviewee:** Those are brands that, compared to this one, are more important for environmental protection... more committed to environmental protection. Hmm. |
| **Me:** 那這些其他的品牌妳有買過嗎？                                                                                                                        | **Me:** Have you bought these other brands before?                                                                                                                    |
| **Interviewee:** 有，我有買過Aveda (註: TXT 誤聽為 avenda)。                                                                                                   | **Interviewee:** Yes, I have bought Aveda (Note: TXT misheard as avenda).                                                                                             |
| **Me:** OK。妳覺得怎麼樣？                                                                                                                                  | **Me:** OK. What do you think of it?                                                                                                                                  |
| **Interviewee:** 我覺得還不錯啊，我覺得它的東西是好的。                                                                                                     | **Interviewee:** I think it's quite good, I think their products are good.                                                                                            |
| **Me:** 好。那看到這個會影響妳的想法嗎？妳會考慮買其他的品牌嗎？                                                                                              | **Me:** Okay. Does seeing this influence your thoughts? Would you consider buying other brands?                                                                       |
| **Interviewee:** 會，我會考慮買其他的品牌。但，呃...我覺得還是要有...他們要有，怎麼講，相同的性質嗎？這樣子。我覺得，因為我覺得化妝品的可替代性不一定有那麼大。如果我很在乎這個產品，因為像，其實像Dior的唇膏，它其實是高價位的嘛。我今天在選擇買高價位的東西的時候，可能代表 (註: TXT 誤聽為 代錶) 著它背後有我想要的東西，例如說：一、我想要拿著，呃，因為類似我想要拿著名牌的東西之類的；然後二、就是這個東西它足夠那麼好，讓我願意花那麼多的價格。所以其實像其他的品牌的話，除非它有達到我這兩個需求跟想法，不然我可能不會輕易地做替代。 | **Interviewee:** Yes, I would consider buying other brands. But, uh... I feel there still needs to be... they need to have, how should I put it, similar characteristics? Like that. I feel, because I think the substitutability of cosmetics isn't necessarily that high. If I really care about this product, because like, actually like Dior lipstick, it's high-priced, right? When I choose to buy high-priced items today, it might represent (Note: TXT misheard) that behind it, there's something I want, for example: one, I want to hold, uh, because it's like I want to hold designer items, things like that; and two, this item is good enough that I'm willing to pay such a high price. So actually, for other brands, unless they meet these two needs and thoughts of mine, otherwise I probably wouldn't easily substitute. |
| **Me:** 好。然後妳幫我開第三個部分。好，妳覺得這個是什麼？                                                                                                  | **Me:** Okay. Then help me open the third section. Okay, what do you think this is?                                                                                  |
| **Interviewee:** 這個...「你可以購買過去」喔？這是代號？這是什麼意思啊？可以追蹤你購買的產品的公司？這都是這個品牌的，是嗎？都是這個品牌的。對。那為什麼代號不一樣？喔，產地不一樣是嗎？ | **Interviewee:** This... "You can buy past" huh? Is this a code? What does this mean? Can track the company of the products you bought? Are these all from this brand? All from this brand. Right. Then why are the codes different? Oh, is the place of origin different? |
| **Me:** 兩個不同的國家。對，兩個不同。可以投資這個品牌。嗯，對。那妳之前有投資過嗎？                                                                        | **Me:** Two different countries. Yes, two different ones. You can invest in this brand. Hmm, yes. Have you invested before?                                             |
| **Interviewee:** 我之前沒有投資過這兩個品牌。                                                                                                               | **Interviewee:** I haven't invested in these two brands before.                                                                                                       |
| **Me:** 有接觸 (註: TXT 誤聽為 金屬) 投資嗎？妳說股票那種嗎？對。妳說妳有做過投資這件事嗎？                                                                   | **Me:** Have you had contact with (Note: TXT misheard as "metal") investing? You mean stocks? Yes. You mean have you done investing before?                 |
| **Interviewee:** 有，有。但我沒有投資過這個品牌。對。                                                                                                       | **Interviewee:** Yes, yes. But I haven't invested in this brand. Right.                                                                                             |
| **Me:** 那妳有投資過是台灣的公司還是國外？                                                                                                                  | **Me:** Have you invested in Taiwanese companies or foreign ones?                                                                                                   |
| **Interviewee:** 我投資過台灣跟國外的都有。OK。嗯。                                                                                                         | **Interviewee:** I've invested in both Taiwanese and foreign ones. OK. Hmm.                                                                                         |
| **Me:** 那妳覺得買 (註: TXT 誤聽為 賣) 東西跟投資這個公司有什麼（關係）？還是在完全不一樣的世界？                                                           | **Me:** So, do you think buying (Note: TXT misheard as "selling") things and investing in this company have any (relationship)? Or are they in completely different worlds? |
| **Interviewee:** 買東西跟投資這個東西，我覺得是有（關係）。我覺得有可能性質不太一樣，但是我覺得買東西也是在增加嗎？增加這個...這個公司的那些資金啊那些的東西。就是妳其實是在...妳做這件事情對於公司是有好的效益。 | **Interviewee:** Buying things and investing in this thing, I think there is (a relationship). I think the nature might be slightly different, but I feel buying things is also increasing, right? Increasing this... this company's funds and those things. It means you actually are... doing this action has a good benefit for the company. |
| **Me:** 那如果妳非常喜歡一個公司的產品，妳會比較考慮買這個公司的股票嗎？                                                                                      | **Me:** So if you really like a company's product, would you be more inclined to consider buying that company's stock?                                              |
| **Interviewee:** 我覺得我會，我覺得我會。                                                                                                                   | **Interviewee:** I think I would, I think I would.                                                                                                                    |

The first section.                                                                                      |
| **Me:** 那最下面有兩個按鈕，妳想要按一個嗎？                                                                                                                | **Me:** At the very bottom, there are two buttons. Do you want to press one?                                                                                          |
| **Interviewee:** 好，我按這個好了。                                                                                                                           | **Interviewee:** Okay, I'll press this one.                                                                                                                           |
| **Me:** 妳剛剛按什麼？                                                                                                                                      | **Me:** What did you just press?                                                                                                                                      |
| **Interviewee:** 我按了「尋找替代產品」。                                                                                                                     | **Interviewee:** I pressed "Find Alternative Products".                                                                                                               |
| **Me:** 那為什麼按這個？                                                                                                                                    | **Me:** Why press this one?                                                                                                                                           |
| **Interviewee:** 因為我已經看到這個產品不太好的部分，我確實會想要去看看有沒有其他可以替代的產品。                                                              | **Interviewee:** Because I've already seen the not-so-good parts of this product, I would indeed want to see if there are other products that can substitute it.      |
| **Me:** 好 (註: TXT 誤聽為 蛤)。那，呃，它有跟妳說什麼？                                                                                                        | **Me:** Okay (Note: TXT misheard as "Huh"). Then, uh, what did it tell you?                                                                                            |
| **Interviewee:** 他說，喔，就他講出Dior它這個品牌對於環境汙染的問題，然後除此之外有三家公司嗎？有三家公司，它其實是對環境比較友善的，這樣子。然後他就在分析說這幾家公司的ESG評分，還有一些跟環境有關的項目。 | **Interviewee:** It said, oh, it pointed out the environmental pollution issues of this Dior brand, and besides that, are there three companies? There are three companies that are actually more environmentally friendly, like that. Then it analyzed the ESG ratings of these companies, and some environment-related items. |
| **Me:** 那妳覺得它跟妳說的是有用的嗎？                                                                                                                      | **Me:** Do you think what it told you is useful?                                                                                                                    |
| **Interviewee:** 這個是...當然是有用的，我覺得這是有用的，確實這是真的。                                                                                    | **Interviewee:** This is... of course it's useful, I think this is useful, indeed this is true.                                                                      |
| **Me:** 對，我剛剛有想到這個問題。                                                                                                                          | **Me:** Yes, I just thought of this question.                                                                                                                         |
| **Interviewee:** 會，我會。而且其實它雖然告訴我這些資訊是有用的，但是它這些東西，因為我看不見它的數據，所以我覺得這是有點類似主觀的想法嗎？這樣子。例如說，他直接跟我說喔這是低 (註: TXT 誤聽為 d)、這是高、這是中，然後有待改善、哪裡不好什麼之類的，但他沒有給我看到那個數據。 | **Interviewee:** Yes, I would. And actually, although the information it tells me is useful, but these things, because I can't see its data, so I feel it's a bit like a subjective thought? Like that. For example, it directly tells me oh this is low (Note: TXT misheard as d), this is high, this is medium, then needs improvement, where it's not good, things like that, but it didn't show me the data. |
| **Me:** 好。那妳有什麼問題想問它嗎？也可以自己打字，還是可以按按鈕都可以。問它什麼都可以問。妳要去上面...上面。                                                 | **Me:** Okay. Do you have any questions you want to ask it? You can also type yourself, or you can press the buttons. You can ask it anything. You need to go up... up. |
| **Me:** 妳剛剛問什麼？                                                                                                                                      | **Me:** What did you just ask?                                                                                                                                        |
| **Interviewee:** 我剛剛問它「我怎麼可以更環保？」                                                                                                             | **Interviewee:** I just asked it, "How can I be more environmentally friendly?"                                                                                       |
| **Me:** 那這個內容裡面有什麼妳之前 (註: TXT 用 最近) 不知道的嗎？                                                                                           | **Me:** Is there anything in this content that you didn't know before (Note: TXT used "recently")?                                                                     |
| **Interviewee:** 我之前 (註: TXT 用 最近) 不知道...「考慮購買就」...沒有，其實這些東西我都知道。                                                               | **Interviewee:** Before (Note: TXT used "recently") I didn't know... "Consider buying then"... No, actually, I know all these things.                                |
| **Me:** OK。那妳可以介紹一下它跟妳說什麼嗎？好。妳自己覺得重點在哪裡？妳覺得哪裡重要？                                                                       | **Me:** OK. Can you explain what it told you? Okay. What do you think the main point is? Where do you think is important?                                        |
| **Interviewee:** 呃，我覺得重要的有那個吧，「減少購物頻率」，還有「修理而非丟棄」，還有「支持本地產品」，這三個。                                                   | **Interviewee:** Uh, I think the important ones are that, "Reduce shopping frequency," also "Repair instead of discarding," and "Support local products," these three. |
| **Me:** 好的。那妳有其他的問題想問嗎？嗯，也可以再次打字 (註: TXT 誤聽為 答次) 問。                                                                        | **Me:** Okay. Do you have other questions you want to ask? Hmm, you can also type (Note: TXT misheard as "answer times") again to ask.                        |
| **Me:** 這個妳問什麼？                                                                                                                                      | **Me:** What did you ask about this?                                                                                                                                  |
| **Interviewee:** 「欸，我買的產品裡有沒有對我身體有害的化學物質？」                                                                                           | **Interviewee:** "Hey, are there any chemical substances harmful to my body in the products I buy?"                                                                 |
| **Interviewee:** 喔，然後它跟我說可以告訴它具體的產品或品牌，所以我（下次）是要打字嗎？                                                                       | **Interviewee:** Oh, then it told me I can tell it the specific product or brand, so do I need to type (next time)?                                                  |
| **Me:** 對。好。（看到 interviewee 在打字）妳要寫什麼？ 沒關係。                                                                                             | **Me:** Yes. Okay. (Sees interviewee typing) What are you writing? It's okay.                                                                                       |
| **Me:** 那如果不需要打字，可以跟它用聲音對話比較好嗎？                                                                                                      | **Me:** So if typing isn't needed, would it be better to have a voice conversation with it?                                                                           |
| **Interviewee:** 可以用聲音？好...我覺得目前沒有這個設定。 ... 會比較方便一點。                                                                               | **Interviewee:** Use voice? Okay... I think currently there isn't this setting. ... It would be a bit more convenient.                                          |
| **Me:** 好。妳也可以用英文跟它講喔。好，如果比較方便。                                                                                                      | **Me:** Okay. You can also speak to it in English. Okay, if it's more convenient.                                                                                  |
| **Interviewee:** （嘗試打英文）好像不太好...喔。嗯...（Me: 妳在找什麼？）我在找那個...那個品牌的英文是什麼...沒關係，那我換一個好了。                         | **Interviewee:** (Tries typing in English) Seems not quite right... Oh. Hmm... (Me: What are you looking for?) I'm looking for the... the English name of that brand... Never mind, I'll switch to another one. |
| **Me:** 那這個（回答）的裡面有什麼妳不知道的嗎？                                                                                                            | **Me:** Is there anything in this (answer) that you didn't know?                                                                                                     |
| **Interviewee:** 像其實我不知道口紅裡面會有鉛，然後我也沒有知道鄰苯二甲酸酯這種比較學名一點的化學物質。                                                         | **Interviewee:** Like, actually I didn't know there could be lead in lipstick, and I also didn't know about phthalates, this kind of more scientific chemical substance. |
| **Me:** 好。那妳剛剛提到這個，妳有什麼感覺嗎？會影響妳的想法還是什麼？                                                                                        | **Me:** Okay. You mentioned this just now, do you have any feelings about it? Does it influence your thoughts or anything?                                        |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯，我會意識到好像不要那麼常化妝。對。                                                                                                      | **Interviewee:** Hmm, I'll realize maybe I shouldn't wear makeup so often. Yes.                                                                                     |

Can you help me go back to the Momo page?                                                                                                         |
| **Me:** 呃，最 (註: TXT 誤聽為 桌子) 上面有一個代碼，綠色的那個，妳可以幫我講出來嗎？                                                                       | **Me:** Uh, at the very (Note: TXT misheard as "table") top, there's a code, the green one, can you say it out loud for me?                                       |
| **Interviewee:** 這個代碼是17LSR。(註: Participant read E7L)                                                                                                  | **Interviewee:** This code is 17LSR.

Okay, okay.                                                                                                 |
