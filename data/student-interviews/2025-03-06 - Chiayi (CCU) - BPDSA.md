| **Interviewee:** 喔...它是有環保爭議的品牌喔？不知道這件事耶。                                                                                                                                                                         | **Interviewee:** Oh... it's a brand with environmental controversies? I didn't know about this.                                                                                                                                                |

Huh? For you? Or is there anything you didn't know before?                                                                                                               |
| **Interviewee:** 之前不知道的是，我之前不知道他居然是有環保爭議的品牌。然後這邊的話，可能會看一下這邊。對我重要的話...這個。                                                                                                                                     | **Interviewee:** What I didn't know before is, I didn't know it was actually a brand with environmental controversies. Then here, I might look at this part. If it's important to me... this one.                                                   |

| **Interviewee:** 就是可能...對不起...可能對於...就是我要買這個東西，然後我之後可能要做一些回收啊等等的，然後它也對環境有一些不太好的影響，就會影響我繼續購買這個品牌的東西。                                                                                                                            | **Interviewee:** Just maybe... sorry... maybe for... like I want to buy this thing, and then later I might need to do some recycling, etc., and it also has some not-so-good impacts on the environment, that would affect whether I continue to buy things from this brand. |
| **Interviewer:** 嗯。好。那你...你看可以幫我看第二個部分一下？                                                                                                                                                                       | **Interviewer:** Um. Okay. Can you... look, can you help me look at the second section?                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Interviewee:** 好。                                                                                                                                                                                                          | **Interviewee:** Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Interviewer:** 你覺得這個是什麼？                                                                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewer:** What do you think this is?                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Interviewee:** 這個...這邊是...等一下...什麼？好...這邊應該是他的化學成分嗎？品牌名稱。好。然後檢判...這個部分，他的潛力嗎？因為現在很多企業都在注重永續，然後他們沒有繼續在做一些環保產品的話，可能會對環境造成汙染，然後消費者也可能會去抵制他們的產品。                                                                                                  | **Interviewee:** This... this part is... wait... what? Okay... this part should be its chemical ingredients? Brand name. Okay. Then review... this section, its potential? Because many companies now focus on sustainability, and if they don't continue to make some environmentally friendly products, it might pollute the environment, and consumers might also boycott their products. |
| **Interviewer:** 嗯。那你自己你會考慮這些其他的品牌嗎？                                                                                                                                                                            | **Interviewer:** Um. Would you personally consider these other brands?                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Interviewee:** 其他的品牌？如果我在這邊這個測驗中看到這些，我可能會回去想要查一下，可能會考慮這些品牌。                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewee:** Other brands? If I saw these here in this test, I might go back and want to look them up, might consider these brands.                                                                                                         |
| **Interviewer:** 那你之前有看過這些品牌嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                      | **Interviewer:** Have you seen these brands before?                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Interviewee:** 沒有耶。                                                                                                                                                                                                      | **Interviewee:** No.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Interviewer:** 那如果你...嗯...有什麼問題嗎？想要問什麼嗎？關於這些品牌？                                                                                                                                                             | **Interviewer:** Then if you... um... do you have any questions? Want to ask anything? About these brands?                                                                                                                                      |
| **Interviewee:** 這些品牌...嗯...我也想要看他們...嗯...因為我現在知道他們這些已經對環境有減少一些汙染，那之後可能就會想要繼續看他們的口紅的品牌，品牌的色號出的符不符合標準，然後再來我可以看一下他的外觀是否符合我的期待，可以帶出門的期待。嗯。然後它的價格。                                                                                                   | **Interviewee:** These brands... um... I'd also want to see them... um... because I now know these have already reduced some pollution to the environment, so later I might want to continue looking at their lipstick brands, whether the shades released meet standards, and then I can look at its appearance to see if it meets my expectations, expectations for carrying it out. Um. And its price. |

| **Interviewer:** 你之前有投資過嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewer:** Have you invested before?                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Interviewee:** 沒有，我沒有投資過耶。                                                                                                                                                                                            | **Interviewee:** No, I haven't invested.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Interviewer:** 那你覺得如果你有買過這個品牌，你會想要投資這個公司嗎？如果你覺得這個品牌是好品牌？                                                                                                                                                  | **Interviewer:** Then do you think if you had bought from this brand, would you want to invest in this company? If you feel this brand is a good brand?                                                                                          |
| **Interviewee:** 是好品牌...我如果是好品牌，我才會願意投資他們。但是依我剛剛看，他們對於...呃...環保議題已經有些問題了，而且如果大眾知道這些東西的話，可能會考慮購買其他品牌選擇，就是減少選擇他們的品牌。所以我覺我可能不太會投資他們。                                                                                                        | **Interviewee:** Is it a good brand... If it's a good brand, only then would I be willing to invest in them. But based on what I just saw, they already have some issues with... uh... environmental topics, and if the public knows about these things, they might consider buying other brands, meaning reducing the choice of their brand. So I think I probably wouldn't invest in them much. |
| **Interviewer:** 嗯。那投資不是為了賺錢嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                        | **Interviewer:** Um. Isn't investment for making money?                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Interviewee:** 投資不是為了賺錢嗎？可是...呃...如果我剛剛看那樣的話，他們再持續做同樣的事情的話，股價就會下跌，我這樣也不會賺錢啊。                                                                                                                             | **Interviewee:** Isn't investment for making money? But... uh... if based on what I just saw, if they continue doing the same things, the stock price will fall, and I won't make money that way either.                                            |
| **Interviewer:** 嗯。好。那第一個部分，最...最下面...呃，第一個部分...呃，抱歉。最下面有按鈕，你想要按一個嗎？                                                                                                                                     | **Interviewer:** Um. Okay. Then the first section, the very... bottom... uh, the first section... uh, sorry. At the very bottom there are buttons, do you want to press one?                                                                      |

What does it say?                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Interviewee:** 呃...好。他說以下是 Maybelline 跟其他更具有可持續性的化妝品品牌的比較表。然後他給出的除了 Maybelline，還有資生堂，他有減少包裝物、動物試驗，然後對於可持續發展計畫有積極的推行。他們也沒有動物實驗，然後包裝廢棄物也較低，有更多可持續的選擇。然後露華濃，減少包裝物試驗，也沒有動物的試驗，然後積極推行可持續發展計劃，沒有動物試驗，然後同樣跟資生堂一樣，沒有...包裝廢棄物也更低...有更多可持續選擇。然後這個...Ilia？應該也是。 | **Interviewee:** Uh... okay. It says below is a comparison table of Maybelline and other more sustainable cosmetics brands. Then besides Maybelline, it gives Shiseido, which has reduced packaging waste, animal testing, and actively promotes sustainable development plans. They also don't have animal testing, and packaging waste is lower, with more sustainable options. Then Revlon, reduced packaging waste testing, also no animal testing, and actively promotes sustainable development plans, no animal testing, and similarly to Shiseido, no... packaging waste is also lower... more sustainable options. Then this... Ilia? Probably also. |
| **Interviewer:** 你覺得這裡有什麼對你來說重要的資料嗎？                                                                                                                                                                            | **Interviewer:** Do you think there's any important information here for you?                                                                                                                                                                  |

Like, you can choose, if you feel something is important, in which part?                                                                                                                                  |
| **Interviewee:** 我蠻看重這個耶，動物實驗的。因為我覺得我蠻喜歡小動物的，所以我對於一些...而且我看過一些就是用動物測試實驗的，我覺得都不太好。所以我蠻看重這個。我覺得有動物的實驗我都盡量不太會買他們。                                                                                                             | **Interviewee:** I care quite a bit about this one, animal testing. Because I feel I quite like small animals, so for some... and I've seen some that use animals for testing experiments, I feel they are not very good. So I care a lot about this. I feel if there's animal testing, I try my best not to buy from them. |

| **Interviewee:** 我問我買的產品裡有沒有對我身體有害化學物質。嗯。然後他說，要了解你購買的產品中是否含有化學物質，可以查看產品的成分標籤或是產品的數位產品護照，這通常會提供詳細的成分跟 ESG 數據。                                                                                                                       | **Interviewee:** I asked if the product I bought contains any harmful chemical substances for my body. Um. Then it said, to understand if the product you purchased contains chemical substances, you can check the product's ingredient label or the product's digital product passport, which usually provides detailed ingredients and ESG data. |
| **Interviewer:** 嗯。那還有待會問你的問題嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                      | **Interviewer:** Um.

| **Interviewee:** 還要問別的問題嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewee:** Need to ask other questions?                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Interviewer:** 不是，他剛剛不是問一個問題嗎？我可以幫你查看數位產品護照？                                                                                                                                                               | **Interviewer:** No, didn't it just ask a question? I can help you check the digital product passport?                                                                                                                                          |

| **Interviewer:** 那這個...這個都是假的，它跟這個產品沒有關係。但是基本上這個想法是，如果...如果一個產品，那個產品可以有一個護照...這個基本上是假的。它...什麼樣的產品...你知道這個嗎？你知道有一些產品有護照嗎？                                                                                                                 | **Interviewer:** Then this... this is all fake, it's not related to this product.

Do you know some products have passports? |
| **Interviewee:** 有，我知道這個東西。                                                                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewee:** Yes, I know about this thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| **Interviewee:** 產地、成分，然後我也想看剛剛那個有沒有動物試驗。嗯...還有什麼...我想一下喔。有些有永續標章，我覺得有沒有永續標章可以標出來。嗯，大概就這樣。                                                                                                                           | **Interviewee:** Origin, ingredients, then I also want to see that one just now about animal testing. Um... what else... let me think. Some have sustainability labels, I think whether it has a sustainability label could be marked. Um, probably just that. |
| **Interviewer:** 好。那這樣就可以了。那你可以幫我回那個原本的地方？它最上面有一個代碼。這個綠色的代碼。你可以幫我講出來嗎？                                                                                                                                        | **Interviewer:** Okay. Then that's fine. Can you help me go back to the original place? At the very top, there's a code. This green code. Can you say it out loud for me?                                                                          |
| **Interviewee:** 綠...就是這個？這個代碼？喔...B-P-D-S-A。                                                                                                                                                                       | **Interviewee:** Green... just this one? This code? Oh... B-P-D-S-A.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Interviewer:** 好。那你可以幫我寫在卡片上？那你覺得最重要的部分是什麼？你可以幫我拍照一張？                                                                                                                                                      | **Interviewer:** Okay. Can you help me write it on the card? Then what do you think is the most important part? Can you take one photo for me?                                                                                                 |
| **Interviewee:** 最重要？嗯。                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **Interviewee:** Most important? Um.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Interviewer:** 可以用你的手機拍照。                                                                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewer:** You can use your phone to take the photo.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Interviewee:** 這邊？為什麼？這邊？欸...就是我剛剛，我覺得這麼...我對於這個我蠻驚訝的，因為我一直都不知道 Maybelline 是這種品牌，就嚇到我。                                                                                                                            | **Interviewee:** Here? Why? Here? Eh... just now, I felt this... I was quite surprised by this, because I never knew Maybelline was this kind of brand, it shocked me.                                                                          |
| **Interviewer:** 你講出來一下。                                                                                                                                                                                                  | **Interviewer:** Say it out loud briefly.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Interviewee:** 呃...Maybelline 過去受環保爭議，包括包裝廢棄物跟動物試驗問題。然後這件事讓我蠻驚訝的，因為我一直以為 Maybelline 沒有做出這種事情，所以我之前都會買他們商品。但是可能看過這個之後，我就會對要買他們商品這件事再考慮一下。                                                                                                | **Interviewee:** Uh... Maybelline has faced environmental controversies in the past, including packaging waste and animal testing issues. Then this matter surprised me quite a bit, because I always thought Maybelline didn't do this kind of thing, so I used to buy their products. But maybe after seeing this, I will reconsider buying their products. |
| **Interviewer:** 好，謝謝。                                                                                                                                                                                                    | **Interviewer:** Okay, thank you.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
