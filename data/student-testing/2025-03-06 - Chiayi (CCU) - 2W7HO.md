| **Interviewer:** 啊。那你電磁爐的話，你有找到你想要的這種的嗎？                                                                                                                                                                            | **Interviewer:** Ah. For induction cookers, did you find the type you were looking for?                                                                                                                                                          |

| **Interviewer:** 你跟電磁爐的品牌熟嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                            | **Interviewer:** Are you familiar with induction cooker brands?                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Interviewee:** 你說這個嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                                  | **Interviewee:** You mean this one?                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Interviewer:** 就是你之前有買過嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewer:** Like, have you bought it before?                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Interviewee:** 沒有沒有，但就是想買買看。                                                                                                                                                                                        | **Interviewee:** No, no, but I just wanted to buy and try it.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Interviewer:** 那為什麼選剛才選這個呢？                                                                                                                                                                                          | **Interviewer:** Then why did you choose this one just now?                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Interviewee:** 因為他有講到，像如果是買電磁爐的話，我就會看他會不會挑鍋子啊，或者是有沒有特別其他的需求之類的。畢竟是買電器。                                                                                                                                           | **Interviewee:** Because it mentioned, like if I'm buying an induction cooker, I'll check if it's compatible with all pots, or if there are any other special requirements. After all, it's an electrical appliance.                                 |
| **Interviewer:** 那你還是會考慮其他的嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                          | **Interviewer:** Would you still consider others?                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Interviewee:** 還有一個應該是價錢，就是它的價錢是可以接受的，不會太貴。                                                                                                                                                                   | **Interviewee:** Another factor would be the price; its price is acceptable, not too expensive.                                                                                                                                                |
| **Interviewer:** 那其他的重要點是什麼？你覺得這個網頁上最重要的點是什麼？                                                                                                                                                                    | **Interviewer:** What are other important points? What do you think is the most important point on this webpage?                                                                                                                                 |
| **Interviewee:** 這個網頁上最重要的點？嗯...喔，照片，照片。就是它會不會吸引我點進去看。                                                                                                                                                            | **Interviewee:** The most important point on this webpage? Um... Oh, the photos, the photos. Like, whether they attract me to click and look.                                                                                                    |
| **Interviewer:** 好。那還有什麼嗎？重要的？                                                                                                                                                                                        | **Interviewer:** Okay. Is there anything else? That's important?                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Interviewee:** 如果是看網頁的話，我應該會蠻重視就是它容不容易使用。就是我可以很清楚，比如說我現在要找這個東西，我知道它哪裡，比如說它會幫我分類好，這邊就是電器用品，那我就可點進去，然後查之類的。就比較方便我使用。                                                                                                                             | **Interviewee:** If I'm looking at the webpage, I'd probably place importance on how easy it is to use. Like, I can clearly see, for example, if I want to find this item now, I know where it is. For instance, it helps categorize things well, here are the electrical appliances, then I can click in and search, etc. It's more convenient for me to use. |
| **Interviewer:** 那你會看它的評論嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewer:** Do you look at its reviews?                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Interviewee:** 評論還是會小小看一下，但評論我可能會比較偏向去網路上直接看人家...                                                                                                                                                                | **Interviewee:** I'll still briefly look at the reviews, but for reviews, I might be more inclined to go online and directly see what people say...                                                                                             |
| **Interviewer:** 你可以幫我講大聲一點好不好？                                                                                                                                                                                      | **Interviewer:** Could you speak a bit louder, please?                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Interviewee:** 就是如果是評論的話，我應該會比較偏向，比如說我直接再開一個網頁去找人家說有沒有用過這個。                                                                                                                                               | **Interviewee:** Like, if it's about reviews, I'd probably lean towards, for example, opening another webpage directly to find if people say they've used this.                                                                                |
| **Interviewer:** 為什麼呢？                                                                                                                                                                                                    | **Interviewer:** Why is that?                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Interviewee:** 因為有可能他們買這個東西不是在這個平台買的。然後這樣我可以看到比較全面的評論。                                                                                                                                                         | **Interviewee:** Because it's possible they bought this item on a different platform. And this way, I can see more comprehensive reviews.                                                                                                       |
| **Interviewer:** 好。那剛剛那個右邊有一個黃色的部分，你覺得這個是什麼？                                                                                                                                                                       | **Interviewer:** Okay. Just now, there was a yellow section on the right side, what do you think that is?                                                                                                                                       |

| **Interviewee:** 介紹公司、這個產品的... 這個我可能就不太會看，因為我也看不懂。                                                                                                                                                                | **Interviewee:** Introducing the company, this product's... I probably wouldn't look closely at this, because I don't understand it anyway.                                                                                                         |
| **Interviewer:** 哦，看不懂。嗯，OK。那，呃，你幫我看一下，你覺得它裡面有什麼重要的嗎？對你來說？                                                                                                                                                     | **Interviewer:** Oh, don't understand. Um, OK. Then, uh, take a look for me, do you think there's anything important inside it? For you?                                                                                                      |
| **Interviewee:** 重要的可能是...像這個。                                                                                                                                                                                           | **Interviewee:** What might be important is... like this.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Interviewer:** 這個是什麼？                                                                                                                                                                                                  | **Interviewer:** What is this?                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| **Interviewer:** OK。為什麼這個很重要？                                                                                                                                                                                            | **Interviewer:** OK.

| **Interviewee:** 感覺現在的人很重視這方面。就是包含什麼塑化劑啊，或是一些...之前不是有個什麼...什麼懸浮粒子什麼東東？我搞不清楚。反正就是環境方面的。                                                                                                                                    | **Interviewee:** Feels like people nowadays care a lot about this aspect. Including things like plasticizers, or some... wasn't there something before... some suspended particles or something? I'm not clear. Anyway, it's related to the environment. |
| **Interviewer:** OK。那，你覺得這個內容的重點是什麼？                                                                                                                                                                                | **Interviewer:** OK. So, what do you think is the main point of this content?                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Interviewee:** 重點是...這個產品對環境的影響。雖然有受到批評，但他們有...還是已經有在進步了。                                                                                                                                                           | **Interviewee:** The main point is... the environmental impact of this product. Although it has received criticism, they have... they have already been improving.                                                                                 |
| **Interviewer:** 嗯。那下面還有其他的嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                          | **Interviewer:** Um. Are there others below?                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Interviewee:** 下面的就是在講材料，然後產地吧。我覺得產地有些人可能也會看，就是有可能，不是會有人會覺得中國製造的就是品質比較不好之類的。                                                                                                                                    | **Interviewee:** Below it talks about materials, and origin, I guess. I think some people might look at the origin, because it's possible, aren't there people who feel that 'Made in China' means lower quality, etc.                             |
| **Interviewer:** 嗯。那，你覺得其他這個會影響你的想法嗎？                                                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewer:** Um. So, do you think these other things would influence your thoughts?                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Interviewee:** 我可能會看東西。就是如果像我剛剛，因為我剛剛沒有看到這個，如果是電器的話，我可能就會再思考一下，因為有點危險的感覺。                                                                                                                                         | **Interviewee:** I might look at the item itself. Like just now, because I didn't see this earlier, if it's an electrical appliance, I might reconsider, because it feels a bit risky.                                                          |
| **Interviewer:** 哦，好。那上面還有其他的部分，幫我...幫忙按一下，有看得到嗎？                                                                                                                                                               | **Interviewer:** Oh, okay. Then there are other sections above, help me... click them please, can you see them?                                                                                                                                  |

| **Interviewee:** 這也是在講環境的嗎？現在好像很多人都在注重這個碳排放，就包含氣候變遷啊那些的。                                                                                                                                                           | **Interviewee:** Is this also talking about the environment? It seems like many people are focusing on carbon emissions now, including climate change and those things.                                                                            |
| **Interviewer:** 哦。那下面的在說什麼？不是，剛剛那個黃色的...你覺得這些東西是什麼？                                                                                                                                                                | **Interviewer:** Oh. What does the part below say? No, the yellow one from earlier... what do you think these things are?                                                                                                                       |
| **Interviewee:** 這個嗎？不是不是，那個剛剛下面這邊。哦，這些是什麼？這些綠科技？哦哦...然後第三層應該是在告訴我們這個產品，它就是有關碳排放的東西，然後可能怕我們看不懂，所以旁邊很有解釋之類的。                                                                                                                 | **Interviewee:** This one? No no, the one below just now. Oh, what are these? These green technologies? Oh oh... And the third layer is probably telling us about this product, things related to carbon emissions, and maybe because they're afraid we won't understand, there are explanations on the side. |

| **Interviewer:** 那你覺得它的內容怎麼樣呢？                                                                                                                                                                                          | **Interviewer:** What do you think of its content?                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Interviewee:** 我覺得蠻不錯的。因為通常在買股票的時候，還是會看一下公司，當然公司的發展啦。然後它這裡又有圖表，然後又蠻好，就是蠻明顯可以看得出來的。然後又有公司的介紹。然後這邊還有自然方面，因為可能自然方面，就是以後在買股票，自然方面可能也會蠻注重，就有一些比較重視環保的產業可能也會慢慢的股價會上升之類的。                                                                                              | **Interviewee:** I think it's quite good. Because usually when buying stocks, you still look at the company, of course, the company's development. And here it has charts, and they are quite good, quite clear and easy to see. And there's a company introduction. Then there's the nature aspect here, because maybe the nature aspect, like when buying stocks in the future, the nature aspect might also be quite important, some industries that value environmental protection more might see their stock prices rise slowly, etc. |
| **Interviewer:** 那你有現在在考慮買什麼股票嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                    | **Interviewer:** Are you currently considering buying any stocks?                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Interviewee:** 沒有啊，因為我還沒上課，我不知道，不敢亂買。                                                                                                                                                                             | **Interviewee:** No, because I haven't taken the class yet, I don't know, I don't dare to buy randomly.                                                                                                                                         |
| **Interviewer:** 那如果這個軟體讓你買股票，你會使用嗎？                                                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewer:** If this software allowed you to buy stocks, would you use it?                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Interviewee:** 我應該不會為了買股票特別購入這個東西。但是如果它是，譬如說，我是這個網站的會員，買了會員可以有這個的話，那我會買會員，因為我買東西的同時還可以順便看這個。                                                                                                                               | **Interviewee:** I probably wouldn't specifically get this thing just to buy stocks. But if it was, for example, if I was a member of this website, and buying a membership gave access to this, then I would buy the membership, because while shopping, I could also look at this conveniently. |
| **Interviewer:** 好。那你可以幫我回那個第一個表嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                | **Interviewer:** Okay.

Then at the very bottom there are buttons... did it register the click?                                                                                                                                                |
| **Interviewee:** 這個嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                                      | **Interviewee:** This one?                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Interviewer:** 啊，你看看...你...啊，有兩個按鈕，你覺得哪一個比較有興趣？                                                                                                                                                                  | **Interviewer:** Ah, take a look... you... ah, there are two buttons, which one are you more interested in?                                                                                                                                     |
| **Interviewee:** (Clicks button)                                                                                                                                                                                               | **Interviewee:** (Clicks button)                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Interviewer:** 啊，你剛剛...你幫我講出來，你剛剛按什麼按鈕？                                                                                                                                                                            | **Interviewer:** Ah, you just... tell me, what button did you just press?                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Interviewee:** 我剛剛是按替代產品。                                                                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewee:** I just pressed "Alternative Products".                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Interviewer:** 好。那為什麼你選這個按鈕呢？                                                                                                                                                                                      | **Interviewer:** Okay. Why did you choose this button?                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Interviewee:** 因為可能這個產品我剛點進來的時候，我覺得他還可以有更好的地方。比如說我考慮的點可能會是，假設我剛剛是因為他的價格進來的的話，結果我發現我進來之後發現他使用的可能方法比較複雜啊，或者是像剛剛那個產地的問題。所以我就會想要看一下有沒有跟他差不多，然後可以替代他的。                                                                                                                 | **Interviewee:** Because maybe when I first clicked on this product, I felt there could be better aspects. For example, the points I consider might be, suppose I came in because of its price, but then after entering, I found that its usage might be more complicated, or like the origin issue just mentioned. So I would want to see if there's something similar to it that can replace it. |
| **Interviewer:** 好。那你可以幫我按那個...嗯...對。那，嗯，你有什麼問題你想要問他嗎？就是看到這個...呃...你有什麼問題你想要問嗎？                                                                                                                                  | **Interviewer:** Okay. Can you press that... um... right. So, um, do you have any questions you want to ask it? Seeing this... uh... do you have any questions you want to ask?                                                                    |
| **Interviewee:** 我應該會想要問他，就是請他直接給我可以替代的產品。就他跟我講，他是跟我講品牌的，但品牌裡面的電磁鍋可能還是有很多種。我會跟他講我的需求，然後請他能不能幫我找到。                                                                                                                             | **Interviewee:** I would probably want to ask it, like, ask it to directly give me alternative products. Like it told me, it told me brands, but within the brands, there might still be many types of induction cookers. I would tell it my needs, and ask if it can help me find one. |
| **Interviewer:** 好。那你可幫我打字嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                            | **Interviewer:** Okay. Can you type that for me?                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Interviewee:** (Types) 完成。好。                                                                                                                                                                                             | **Interviewee:** (Types) Done. Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Interviewer:** 那你覺得這個內容有什麼重要的嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                    | **Interviewer:** Do you think this content is important in any way?                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯...就是因為像剛剛上面這邊，他...我重視的點可能是有沒有不挑鍋，但他沒有寫到，所以我又特別問他。然後他這邊也直接跟我講說他有不挑鍋的設計，然後包含他的優點。然後我可能就想要問他他有什麼缺點之類的，就讓我的那個挑選的時候方便，更全面一點。                                                                                                                | **Interviewee:** Um... because like above just now, it... the point I cared about was maybe whether it's compatible with all pots, but it didn't mention that, so I specifically asked it. And then here it directly told me it has a design compatible with all pots, including its advantages. Then I might want to ask it about its disadvantages, etc., just to make my selection process more convenient and comprehensive. |
| **Interviewer:** 好。那你可幫我使用你的手機拍照這個部分？然後還有你知道這裡的裡面最重要的地方在哪裡？                                                                                                                                                     | **Interviewer:** Okay. Can you use your phone to take a photo of this part? And also, do you know where the most important part is within this?                                                                                                |
| **Interviewee:** 你是說哪方面？                                                                                                                                                                                                | **Interviewee:** In what aspect do you mean?                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Interviewer:** 就是全部的裡面，剛剛那個 momo 上，還是這裡？對你來說最重要的地方在哪裡？                                                                                                                                                           | **Interviewer:** Like within everything, on the momo page earlier, or here? For you, where is the most important part?                                                                                                                          |
| **Interviewee:** 我覺得這個功能應該對我來說會是目前最重要的。                                                                                                                                                                           | **Interviewee:** I think this function [the chatbot/alternative finder] would probably be the most important for me right now.                                                                                                                       |
