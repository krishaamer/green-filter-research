| **Interviewee:** 他說短期的，短期的股價比較跌，然後也因為勞工問題，然後遭受批評。                                                                                                                                                            | **Interviewee:** It says short-term, the short-term stock price has fallen, and also due to labor issues, it has received criticism.                                                                                                             |
| **Interviewer:** 還有什麼嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                                  | **Interviewer:** Anything else?                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Interviewee:** 如果這個品牌持續努力的話，他的評價會提高，然後會有助於整體的品牌形象。                                                                                                                                                           | **Interviewee:** If this brand continues to work hard, its evaluation will improve, and it will help the overall brand image.                                                                                                                |
| **Interviewer:** 那這些三個...考慮這些三個部分，你覺得哪一個比較你有興趣的？                                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewer:** Then these three... considering these three sections, which one are you more interested in?                                                                                                                                     |
| **Interviewee:** 呃...有興趣的？請問是會影響到我買這個商品的哪一部分會比較影響到我買商品的原因嗎？                                                                                                                                                 | **Interviewee:** Uh... interested in? Do you mean which part would affect my purchase of this product, which part would influence my reason for buying the product more?                                                                         |
| **Interviewer:** 對對對。                                                                                                                                                                                                      | **Interviewer:** Yes, yes, yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Interviewee:** 呃...可能是第一個吧。因為投資可能跟這個...這個公司的未來的股價可能跟我買這個商品沒有太大的關聯，所以我可能會看第一個買東西。因為它有很明確的指出這個商品它不太環保，然後就跟...就是可能我以後再看其他的商品之後會比較考慮到環保的部分。因為平常買東西不太會考慮環保的部分。但是如果其他的品牌沒有那麼好看，可能還是會考慮一下，會平衡一下。對，因為現在應該還沒有聽過。                                                                                             | **Interviewee:** Uh... maybe the first one. Because investment might be related to this... this company's future stock price might not have much connection to me buying this product, so I might look at the first one about buying things. Because it very clearly pointed out that this product is not very environmentally friendly, and then... just maybe when I look at other products in the future, I will consider the environmental aspect more. Because normally when buying things, I don't really consider the environmental part. But if other brands don't look as good, I might still consider it, balance it out. Yes, because I probably haven't heard of them yet. |
