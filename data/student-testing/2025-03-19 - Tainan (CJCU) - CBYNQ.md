| **Interviewee:** 他寫代號，應該是就是這間公司的代號，然後底下應該就是他列出來的股票的圖表。                                                                                                                                                          | **Interviewee:** It writes code, it should be the code for this company, and below should be the stock charts it listed.                                                                                                                        |

| **Interviewee:** 我想一下...我看一下...(Looks at chart)...我可能不會買，因為它的波動有點太大了。                                                                                                                                            | **Interviewee:** Let me think... let me see... (Looks at chart)... I probably wouldn't buy, because its volatility is a bit too high.                                                                                                         |

Philips I've heard of, but Impression also seems familiar, but this one... no.                                                                                                                                            |

| **Interviewee:** 嗯...這個品牌，我記得飛利浦的品牌我記得還不錯，但是它好像用在其他電器商品。對。然後印象...我忘記是哪一個商品。                                                                                                                               | **Interviewee:** Um... this brand, I remember the Philips brand, I remember it's quite good, but it seems to be used in other electrical appliances.
