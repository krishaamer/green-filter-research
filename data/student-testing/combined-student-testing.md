| **Me:** 好，我再問一次，這個是我的論文的一部分的一個App，希望妳幫幫我測試。我會錄音妳的聲音，但是妳的回覆都是匿名的，可以嗎？                                   | **Me:** Okay, let me ask again. This is an app that's part of my thesis. I hope you can help me test it. I will record your voice, but your responses will be anonymous. Is that okay? |
| **Interviewee:** 可以，可以。                                                                                                                               | **Interviewee:** Yes, yes.                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Me:** 好，謝謝。那可以開始了。好。呃，妳之前有用過Momo嗎？                                                                                                | **Me:** Okay, thank you. We can start then. Okay. Uh, have you used Momo before?                                                                                               |
| **Interviewee:** 有，可是用蝦皮比較多。                                                                                                                     | **Interviewee:** Yes, but I use Shopee more often.                                                                                                                            |
| **Me:** 好。那妳平常買什麼？                                                                                                                                | **Me:** Okay. What do you usually buy?                                                                                                                                        |
| **Interviewee:** 平常嗎？衣服跟化妝品，還有動漫的娃娃。                                                                                                     | **Interviewee:** Usually? Clothes and cosmetics, and also anime dolls.                                                                                                        |
| **Me:** 嗯。那妳可以幫我找一個妳有興趣的產品嗎？                                                                                                            | **Me:** Hmm. Can you help me find a product you're interested in?                                                                                                             |
| **Interviewee:** (Searches) ...有興趣的...產品...面膜。                                                                                                     | **Interviewee:** (Searches) ...Interested in... product... facial mask.                                                                                                       |
| **Me:** 面膜？這個？好。這樣。這個品牌妳有之前買過嗎？                                                                                                      | **Me:** Facial mask? This one? Okay. Like this. Have you bought this brand before?                                                                                             |
| **Interviewee:** 哦，有，有買過。                                                                                                                           | **Interviewee:** Oh, yes, I've bought it before.                                                                                                                              |
| **Me:** 哇哇，好酷喔。買東西基本上，買東西也是一個投資...喔，這個是可以幫忙分析的。                                                                           | **Me:** Wow, wow, so cool. Buying things basically, buying things is also an investment... Oh, this can help analyze.                                                        |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯，哇，酷。                                                                                                                               | **Interviewee:** Hmm, wow, cool.                                                                                                                                              |
| **Me:** 那妳覺得這個內容裡面有什麼對妳來說有用、用途嗎？有用，就是妳覺得有趣的資料，還是妳覺得不錯的材料？                                                    | **Me:** What do you think in this content is useful for you, or serves a purpose? Useful, meaning interesting information, or materials you think are good?                |
| **Interviewee:** 可持續性跟這個歷史問題。平常在逛的時候只會看到就是品牌國家跟那個使用材料，很少看到有這個「材料可持續性」跟「歷史問題」，所以買的時候就會覺得說，就是，哦，買完了可能就，就只是用完了也就只是垃圾，但是我沒有想到說，就是，哦，我沒有想到說就是可能面膜它裡面會有一些不明的植物萃取物跟化學保存劑。應該說是知道，可是不知道說就是它可能，嗯，會有存在風險之類的。 | **Interviewee:** Sustainability and this history issue. Usually when browsing, I only see the brand's country and the materials used. I rarely see this "Material Sustainability" and "History Issues". So when buying, I would think, just, oh, after buying it, maybe it's just, after using it up, it's just trash. But I didn't think that, like, oh, I didn't think that maybe the facial mask could contain some unknown plant extracts and chemical preservatives. I should say I knew, but I didn't know that it might, hmm, pose potential risks, things like that. |
| **Me:** 那妳覺得這個，妳剛知道這個會影響妳的，妳的想法嗎？想法嗎？就是因為妳之前 (註: TXT 用 最近) 有買過這個產品，那妳剛知道好像它裡面可能有什麼化學的...妳對妳關於那個這個產品的那個品牌，妳的想法會改嗎？ | **Me:** So you think this, knowing this just now, will it affect your, your thoughts? Your thoughts? Because you have bought this product before (Note: TXT used "recently"), and you just found out it might contain some chemicals... Regarding this product's brand, will your thoughts change? |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯，會有一點點，會有一點點。可能會去找可能更方便的吧，就是不需要用到面膜，可能只要，嗯，要怎麼說...就是有，有看到就是不需要敷面膜，就是很像就是塗那個...塗，塗那種蘆薈的那種面膜，應該可能之後會買這種。 | **Interviewee:** Hmm, a little bit, a little bit. Maybe I'll look for something more convenient, like something that doesn't require using a sheet mask, maybe just, hmm, how should I say... like, I've seen ones where you don't need to apply a sheet mask, it's like applying... applying that kind of aloe mask, maybe I'll buy that kind later. |
| **Me:** 嗯嗯嗯。好，那下面有一個部分可以按，妳覺得這個，這個是什麼意思？                                                                                    | **Me:** Mm-hmm mm-hmm. Okay, there's a section below you can press. What do you think this, this means?                                                                        |
| **Interviewee:** 積蓄 (註: TXT 誤聽為 金序) 嗎？嗯？假如說我不買這個東西啊，我可以存到多少錢嗎？                                                              | **Interviewee:** Savings (Note: TXT misheard as "Gold Order")? Hmm? Suppose if I don't buy this item, can I save some amount of money?                                     |
| **Me:** 好。那妳要先，呃，思考。                                                                                                                            | **Me:** Okay. Then you need to first, uh, think.                                                                                                                            |
| **Interviewee:** 在思考...妳要吃什麼？我沒有錢吃。 ...妳要給我錢，好嗎？                                                                                     | **Interviewee:** Thinking... What do you want to eat? I have no money to eat. ...You should give me money, okay?                                                               |
| **Interviewee:** 哦...哦！所以積蓄是那個碳排放量 (註: TXT 誤聽為 彈放量)，減少碳排放量？不會是錢？喔？然後說我不買那個面膜我可以...我可以省多少錢？喔，好貴。 | **Interviewee:** Oh... Oh! So savings means the carbon emissions (Note: TXT misheard as "bullet release amount"), reducing carbon emissions? Not money? Oh? And it says if I don't buy that mask I can... I can save how much money? Oh, so expensive. |
| **Me:** 所以中文來說，可能這個詞 (註: TXT 誤聽為 車) 不是最適合的。就是剛剛那個詞 (註: TXT 誤聽為 車)，因為妳剛剛是想...                                             | **Me:** So in Chinese, maybe this word (Note: TXT misheard as "car") isn't the most suitable. Just that word (Note: TXT misheard as "car") earlier, because you were thinking... |
| **Interviewee:** 賺錢？ (註: TXT 誤聽為 罐牛腱/罐牛肉)                                                                                                       | **Interviewee:** Making money? (Note: TXT misheard as "Canned beef tendon/Canned beef")                                                                                        |
| **Me:** 對。                                                                                                                                                | **Me:** Yes.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Interviewee:** 對對對，以為是不買這個東西，或者是可能，可能就是你買這個東西可以省多少錢，或是你不買這個東西可能會省多少錢。這個積蓄的話，我覺得...要怎麼看 (註: TXT 誤聽為 乾)？ | **Interviewee:** Right, right, right. I thought it was about not buying this thing, or maybe, maybe buying this thing could save how much money, or not buying this thing might save how much money. This "Savings", I feel... how should I look at it (Note: TXT misheard as "dry")? |
| **Me:** 好。那第三個部分，投資？                                                                                                                            | **Me:** Okay. Then the third section, Investment?                                                                                                                             |
| **Interviewee:** 投資嗎？投資喔？感覺很像是我要投資這一家的品牌？哪裡啊？投資這是...投資代號？美國、美國、韓國。感覺就是，對啊，就是投資這個品牌。                      | **Interviewee:** Investment? Investment, huh? Feels like I'm supposed to invest in this company's brand? Where? Investment this is... investment code? USA, USA, Korea. Feels like, yeah, investing in this brand. |
| **Me:** 那妳會嗎？                                                                                                                                          | **Me:** Would you?                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Interviewee:** 會。                                                                                                                                       | **Interviewee:** Yes.                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Me:** 好，那妳可以幫我回第一個部分嗎？第一個，買東西。然後下面下面下面...對，有兩個按鈕。如果妳不想要按也可以。                                               | **Me:** Okay, can you help me go back to the first section? The first one, buying things. Then below, below, below... Right, there are two buttons. If you don't want to press them, that's okay too. |
| **Interviewee:** 欸，等我看一下。哇哇哇，這個有點跑掉了。嗯...哇喔。我想一下...「對關心環保 (註: TXT 誤聽為 光環保) 的消費者來說，選擇可持續性的品牌可能會更好。以下是可替代的品牌，並附上簡單的比較表」。哦...這個，這個...那個，它可以再隔一個空位嗎？對，有點看不太懂。 | **Interviewee:** Hey, let me take a look. Wow wow wow, this one is a bit off. Hmm... Wow oh. Let me think... "For consumers concerned about environmental protection (Note: TXT misheard as "only environmental protection"), choosing sustainable brands might be better. Below are alternative brands with a simple comparison table attached." Oh... This, this... that, can it have another space? Right, it's a bit hard to understand. |
| **Me:** 好。好。那妳覺得...妳有另外一個按鈕 (註: TXT 誤聽為 案子)，妳想要問 (註: TXT 誤聽為 玩) AI嗎？                                                           | **Me:** Okay. Okay. So do you think... you have another button (Note: TXT misheard as "case"), do you want to ask (Note: TXT misheard as "play") the AI?             |
| **Interviewee:** AI嗎？隨便都可以。嗯...我想想看喔...「產品會浪費掉多少的碳排放量」？(註: TXT 誤聽為 網品櫃/癱瘓量) ...按到了。                                  | **Interviewee:** AI? Anything is fine. Hmm... Let me think... "How much carbon emission will the product waste?" (Note: TXT misheard as "Net product counter/paralysis amount") ...Pressed it. |

| **Interviewee:** 我本來是要按說「會浪費掉多少的碳排放量」...                                                                                                   | **Interviewee:** I originally wanted to press "How much carbon emission will be wasted"...                                                                                  |
| **Me:** 哇，好清楚喔。                                                                                                                                      | **Me:** Wow, so clear.                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Me:** 好。那要說什麼？妳覺得最...重點是什麼？                                                                                                               | **Me:** Okay. What should I say? What do you think is the most... main point?                                                                                                 |
| **Interviewee:** 重點是什麼？蠻多的捏。就是光是從生產過程就已經開始產生碳排放，然後包裝本來就是也會產生，運輸過程也不用說就是本來就會產生的，只是我沒有想到說就是，最後的使用跟處理，使用過程中的水電消耗以及產品的包裝最終處理回收或掩埋，也會影響到碳排放。 | **Interviewee:** What's the main point? There's quite a lot. Just from the production process, carbon emissions already start being generated. Then packaging itself also generates them. The transportation process goes without saying, it inherently generates them. It's just that I didn't think about, like, the final use and disposal, the water and electricity consumption during use, and the final disposal of the product's packaging – recycling or landfill – would also affect carbon emissions. |
| **Me:** 嗯。好。那這樣就可以了。妳幫我拍照這個畫面 (註: TXT 誤聽為 玩意)，還有那個剛剛那個Momo...Momo，對。好，Momo，等一下...這個部分就可以了。好的。             | **Me:** Hmm. Okay. That's fine then. Help me take a photo of this screen (Note: TXT misheard as "thingy"), and also that Momo from just now... Momo, right. Okay, Momo, wait a moment... this part is fine. Okay. |
| **Interviewee:** 這上面有...                                                                                                                                | **Interviewee:** On top here there's...                                                                                                                                       |

Have you read it recently?                                                                                                               |

You mean its whole process? The whole page?                                                                                             |

| **Interviewee:** 頁面新東西？還有它顯示賣完的 (註: TXT 誤聽為 騰訊賣碗)，有一些東西賣完的，對，然後就找不到了這樣子。                                             | **Interviewee:** New things on the page? And it shows sold out (Note: TXT misheard as "Tencent sells bowls"), some items are sold out, right, and then can't be found like that.       |
| **Me:** 好。那還有什麼嗎？                                                                                                                                  | **Me:** Okay.

| **Interviewee:** 然後還有...我都（會）不會在意，我都直接看價錢，然後看一下還有什麼東西，然後就直接買了。                                                        | **Interviewee:** And also... I (will) won't care, I just look at the price directly, then see what else there is, and then just buy it directly.                                     |
| **Me:** 好。那右邊呢？右邊這個？                                                                                                                              | **Me:** Okay. What about the right side? This one on the right?                                                                                                                       |
| **Interviewee:** 這是妳，這是，這是什麼？這應該是妳製作的那個吧？因為通常出現不會出現這個。                                                                   | **Interviewee:** This is you, this is, what is this? This should be the thing you made, right? Because usually this doesn't appear.                                               |
| **Me:** 好。那它，它的，它給妳講什麼？它有講中文？                                                                                                          | **Me:** Okay. Then it, its, what does it tell you?

| **Interviewee:** 品牌，就是介紹吧。然後還有她的一些其他的什麼作品啊，然後好像包裝 (註: TXT 誤聽為 包藏) 一些之類的。喔，還有它的那個碳排放方面，還有它的一些投資股票嗎？之類的。 | **Interviewee:** Brand, it's an introduction, right? And also some of her other works, and seems like packaging (Note: TXT misheard as "conceal"), things like that. Oh, and its carbon emission aspect, and some of its investments, stocks? Things like that. |
| **Me:** 那這個資料 (註: JSON 誤聽為 cdi) 裡面有什麼妳覺得比較有趣的，還是有興趣的部分嗎？                                                                     | **Me:** Is there anything in this data (Note: JSON misheard as "cdi") that you find particularly interesting, or any parts you're interested in?                               |
| **Interviewee:** 有興趣的部分？對... ESG評分 (註: TXT 誤聽為 美麗徽章)。有，她說去就直接，直接棄她出版社的。蛤？對。嗯。還有勞工問題 (註: TXT 誤聽為 老公問題)。 | **Interviewee:** Interested parts? Right... ESG rating (Note: TXT misheard as "Beautiful Badge"). Yes, she said to go directly, directly abandon her publisher. Huh? Right. Hmm. And labor issues (Note: TXT misheard as "husband issues"). |
| **Me:** 好。對。大概就是這樣子。好。那下面還有兩個按鈕 (註: TXT 誤聽為 案子)。呃，妳想按什麼嗎？還是互相按也可以？                                               | **Me:** Okay. Right. Roughly like this. Okay. Then below there are two buttons (Note: TXT misheard as "cases"). Uh, do you want to press anything? Or pressing each other is also okay? |
| **Interviewee:** （網路問題）...然後你可以問...（AI建議）這個是什麼？「比較」和「資訊」，還有比較其他出版社的那些資訊吧？碳排放的那些資訊。                               | **Interviewee:** (Network issue)... Then you can ask... (AI suggestions) What is this? "Compare" and "Information", and also compare information from other publishers? That carbon emission information. |
| **Me:** 好。對。那這個，這個裡面有什麼有興趣的嗎？找到小褲子 (註: TXT 誤聽為 小棍子)？                                                                      | **Me:** Okay. Right. Is there anything interesting in this one? Found small pants (Note: TXT misheard as "small sticks")?                                                       |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯...蠻興趣的耶。我好像都沒在注意這東西耶。哇，都沒在注意耶。有一些出版社之類的。                                                              | **Interviewee:** Hmm... quite interesting. I seem to have never paid attention to this stuff. Wow, never paid attention. There are some publishers and things like that.            |
| **Me:** 那這題妳有什麼問題想要問Lulu AI嗎？                                                                                                                 | **Me:** Do you have any questions you want to ask Lulu AI about this?                                                                                                           |
| **Interviewee:** 我想想我要問什麼...我也是...如果 (註: TXT 誤聽為 我很煩要) 是五千元就買那個，買那個，買那個...我怎麼中獎 (註: TXT 誤聽為 中錢) 了？嗯。再寫一些相關問題？我要問什麼？哇靠...我要想問什麼問題耶。除了這些還有其他的嗎？總感覺如果問好多...你有特點嗎？那應該是角川 (註: TXT 誤聽為 漫甲無敵) 特點。好像很多。我看了我只知道東立跟那個，我也只知道東立、東立跟那個什麼木馬的，反正就是那些。好，尖端。對，尖端。 | **Interviewee:** Let me think what I want to ask... Me too... if (Note: TXT misheard as "I'm annoyed want") it's 5000 yuan then buy that, buy that, buy that... how did I win the lottery (Note: TXT misheard as "hit money")? Hmm. Write some related questions again? What should I ask? Wow damn... I need to think what question to ask. Besides these, are there others? Feels like if I ask too many... Do you have special features? Then it should be Kadokawa's (Note: TXT misheard as "Man Jia Wu Di") special features. Seems like a lot. I looked, I only know Tong Li and that one, I also only know Tong Li, Tong Li and that what's-it-called Mu Ma, anyway just those. Okay, Sharp Point. Yes, Sharp Point. |
| **Me:** 好。那它剛剛說什麼？                                                                                                                                | **Me:** Okay. What did it say just now?                                                                                                                                       |
| **Interviewee:** 它說，我剛剛問...我問說還有其他出版社的嗎？我看有沒有跟三采 (註: TXT 誤聽為 商政) 差別。還有喔，有「位（慰）（未）」，「綠色書」，「自然之聲 (註: TXT 誤聽為 資深)」，「環保」、「出版」。這些的？這些出版社，可持續發展...喔！值得妳考慮支持喔！ | **Interviewee:** It said, I just asked... I asked if there are other publishers? See if there's a difference with Sanmin (Note: TXT misheard as "business politics"). There are, oh, there's "Wei" (comfort/future), "Green Book", "Voice of Nature (Note: TXT misheard as "senior")", "Environmental Protection", "Publishing". These? These publishers, sustainable development... Oh! Worth your consideration to support! |
| **Me:** 妳有買過這些的嗎？                                                                                                                                  | **Me:** Have you bought from these before?                                                                                                                                    |
| **Interviewee:** 沒有。                                                                                                                                     | **Interviewee:** No.                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Me:** 那如果比如說，他會給妳推薦這些出版社的書本？                                                                                                        | **Me:** What if, for example, it recommends books from these publishers to you?                                                                                                |
| **Interviewee:** 可是它這些書有，有哪些...它有出過哪些書啊？隨便複製一個，「綠色書」，它這個，它沒有...它這個是，這是店面吧？                                 | **Interviewee:** But these books it has, which ones... which books has it published? Just randomly copy one, "Green Book", this one, it doesn't have... this one is, this is a storefront, right? |
| **Me:** 對啊，這是店面啊。                                                                                                                                  | **Me:** Yeah, this is a storefront.                                                                                                                                           |
| **Interviewee:** 對，它推薦的是店面的品牌名稱。                                                                                                               | **Interviewee:** Right, what it recommends are the brand names of storefronts.                                                                                                |
| **Me:** 所以妳相信它跟妳講的這些嗎？ (註: TXT 誤聽為 信號)                                                                                                    | **Me:** So do you believe what it told you? (Note: TXT misheard as "signals")                                                                                                |
| **Interviewee:** 它出...喔，出三采？反正真的有的應該是相信的。因為畢竟我自己也不懂，除非就像是剛剛那個複製貼上去，現在看到發現說，好像這好像其實不是，這不是出版社，而是那個一個地點。好，對。這看起來超級不像那個的...這一本書。 | **Interviewee:** It published... oh, published Sanmin? Anyway, the ones that really exist, I should believe. Because after all, I don't know myself, unless it's like just now, copy-pasting it, now seeing it and finding out, seems like this actually isn't, this isn't a publisher, but rather that one location. Okay, right. This looks super unlike that... this one book. |
| **Me:** 好。對。好。那這樣可以了。妳再幫我拍照一下Momo跟它互動。                                                                                             | **Me:** Okay. Right. Okay. That's fine then. Help me take another photo of Momo and the interaction with it.                                                                  |

| **Me:** 什麼其他的，這個網頁，不是它一定給妳回覆的，妳幫我拍照一下。讓妳熟悉它。                                                                              | **Me:** Anything else, this webpage, not necessarily the one it replied with, help me take a photo.

| **Me:** (Testing audio levels - 水泥abcd請假好了嗎) 嗯好。                                                                                                    | **Me:** (Testing audio levels - cement abcd leave okay?) Hmm okay.                                                                                                                    |

| **Me:** 妳最近有用過Momo (註: JSON 誤聽為 媽媽) 嗎？                                                                                                          | **Me:** Have you used Momo (Note: JSON misheard as "mom") recently?                                                                                                                     |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯，我沒有用過Momo，我有用過蝦皮。                                                                                                           | **Interviewee:** Hmm, I haven't used Momo, I have used Shopee.                                                                                                                          |
| **Me:** OK。那妳平常網路上會買 (註: JSON 誤聽為 賣) 什麼樣的東西？                                                                                          | **Me:** OK. What kind of things do you usually buy (Note: JSON misheard as "sell") online?                                                                                             |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯...我想一下...網路上會買什麼東西...我都買一些蠻奇怪的東西。比如說，因為我喜歡做，嗯，就是吊飾之類的那種手作，所以我會去買那種材料，或是毛線之類的，我也會編織之類的，就是都會上網去買這些東西。 | **Interviewee:** Hmm... let me think... what do I buy online... I buy some rather strange things. For example, because I like to make, hmm, like charms and that kind of handmade craft, so I buy those kinds of materials, or yarn, things like that, I also knit, things like that, I buy all these things online. |
| **Me:** 好。那妳覺得Momo上，有什麼妳想要買的嗎？                                                                                                              | **Me:** Okay. Do you think there's anything you want to buy on Momo?                                                                                                                    |
| **Interviewee:** 我要買，我要買保健食品。我覺得最近的...我覺得我最近的記憶力有點下降，所以我要買維他命來吃。                                                     | **Interviewee:** I want to buy, I want to buy health supplements. I feel like recently... I feel like my memory has been declining recently, so I want to buy vitamins to take.       |
| **Me:** 嗯。(Waiting for page to load) 沒有維他命啊？                                                                                                       | **Me:** Hmm. (Waiting for page to load) No vitamins, huh?                                                                                                                             |
| **Me:** 所以妳想要買這個維他命？嗯。好像這個網頁有沒有圖片嗎？沒有他的圖片啊？（看到圖片）有...他還是在搜尋 (註: TXT 誤聽為 設卡) 嗎？他還沒有弄好嗎？妳可以試試refresh一次。啊，妳覺得是網路的問題嗎？有時候學校網路會這樣子，怪怪的喔。就是，還是妳要連我的？ | **Me:** So you want to buy this vitamin? Hmm. Does this webpage seem to have no pictures? No pictures of it? (Sees picture) There is... Is it still searching (Note: TXT misheard as "setting card")? Is it not ready yet? You can try refreshing once. Ah, do you think it's a network problem? Sometimes the school network is like this, a bit strange. So, or do you want to connect to mine? |
| **Interviewee:** 喔好。                                                                                                                                       | **Interviewee:** Oh okay.                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Me:** 把密碼交出來。                                                                                                                                      | **Me:** Hand over the password.                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Interviewee:** (Connects to hotspot) 真的，是網路的問題。有，圖片是很多的。                                                                               | **Interviewee:** (Connects to hotspot) Really, it's a network problem. Yes, there are many pictures.                                                                                  |
| **Me:** 好。這個妳有最近買過嗎？                                                                                                                              | **Me:** Okay. Have you bought this recently?                                                                                                                                          |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯...有哦。                                                                                                                                  | **Interviewee:** Hmm... Yes.                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Me:** 好酷喔。                                                                                                                                            | **Me:** So cool.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Interviewee:** 我自己本身是沒有吃啦，但是我們家也有人有吃過。但是我那個家人其實沒有很熟，所以我只有聽過他有買過魚油這個東西，我沒有看過他吃過。                         | **Interviewee:** I haven't taken it myself, but someone in my family has taken it before. But I'm not very familiar with that family member, so I've only heard that they bought fish oil, I haven't seen them take it. |
| **Me:** 嗯。那剛剛有發生什麼？有什麼新的東西嗎？哇，這個直接跳出來，好酷喔。                                                                                 | **Me:** Hmm. So what happened just now? Was there anything new? Wow, this popped up directly, so cool.                                                                                |
| **Me:** 那妳覺得他的最明顯的部分是什麼？                                                                                                                    | **Me:** What do you think is its most obvious part?                                                                                                                                   |
| **Interviewee:** 他現在看到的是，他有把碳足跡列出來，就是說這一間公司有沒有那個...他對於環保的概念有沒有那個...他列了很詳細的。                                    | **Interviewee:** What I see now is that it has listed the carbon footprint, meaning whether this company has that... whether it has the concept of environmental protection... it listed it very detailedly. |
| **Me:** 嗯。妳覺得自己環保的人嗎？                                                                                                                          | **Me:** Hmm. Do you consider yourself an environmentally conscious person?                                                                                                            |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯...妳覺得自己環保的人嗎？還是還好？                                                                                                       | **Interviewee:** Hmm... Do you consider yourself an environmentally conscious person? Or just okay?                                                                                 |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯，環保...關心它們 (註: TXT 誤聽為 方法) 吧？是還好。就是我會注意這個，就是因為小時候就常講說那個，如果一個東西啊，最好要在自己，就是自己的家這樣子買，這樣子碳足跡就不會比較高。然後，聽懂的話是還好啦，但是有時候會注意。 | **Interviewee:** Hmm, environmental protection... care about them (Note: TXT misheard as "method"), right? It's okay. It's just that I pay attention to this, because when I was young, people often said that, if there's an item, it's best to buy it in your own, like your own home area, that way the carbon footprint won't be as high. So, if understood, it's okay, but sometimes I do pay attention. |
| **Me:** 那妳覺得這個資料 (註: TXT 誤聽為 細療) 有什麼有用的部分嗎？                                                                                         | **Me:** What do you think is the useful part of this data (Note: TXT misheard as "fine treatment")?                                                                                  |
| **Interviewee:** 有用的部分...有用的部分...我是覺得可以讓使用者看到就是說，哦，你們這一間公司，你要買的這一間公司，它那個，它在環保上面有沒有，它在環保上面有沒有用心，這樣子。哇，這個真的好多喔。我看下其他的選擇。 | **Interviewee:** Useful part... useful part... I feel it can let users see, like, oh, this company you're considering buying from, its, whether it's putting effort into environmental protection, like that. Wow, there's really a lot here. Let me look at other options. |
| **Interviewee:** (Looking at MUJI bag) 無印？這是什麼樣的產品？                                                                                             | **Interviewee:** (Looking at MUJI bag) MUJI? What kind of product is this?                                                                                                           |
| **Me:** 是購物袋。                                                                                                                                          | **Me:** It's a shopping bag.                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Interviewee:** 就是那個...在學校啊，在學校我就看到蠻多人在戴這個無印的購物袋 (註: TXT 誤聽為 跟我感覺)，然後出現這個，大概就...基本上呢，就是大家都會，就走在路上的時候就會，如果我們遇到十個人的話，大概有一半的人就會帶走。 | **Interviewee:** It's that... at school, at school I see quite a lot of people carrying this MUJI shopping bag (Note: TXT misheard as "and my feeling"), and seeing this, probably just... basically, everyone does, when walking on the street, if we meet ten people, probably half of them will carry one away. |

What is this thing?                                                                                                                  |

Do you think you have any questions you want to ask the AI (Note: JSON misheard as "wei wei wei" - feeding sounds)?                                              |
| **Interviewee:** 請問...我想不太到。                                                                                                                          | **Interviewee:** Excuse me...

| **Me:** 如果沒有也可以。                                                                                                                                    | **Me:** It's okay if you don't have any.                                                                                                                                              |

| **Me:** 好啊。那這樣就可以了。手機，妳可以使用妳的手機掃描這個QR。那下面有一個問卷 (註: TXT 誤聽為 溫泉)。那這個測試代碼要就是這些，所以如果妳測試一個產品就可以了。但是妳因為妳測試三個產品，可以寫三個。 | **Me:** Okay. That's fine then. Phone, you can use your phone to scan this QR. Then below there's a questionnaire (Note: TXT misheard as "hot spring"). And this test code is just these, so if you tested one product, that's fine. But since you tested three products, you can write three. |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯。喔。                                                                                                                                     | **Interviewee:** Hmm. Oh.                                                                                                                                                             |

| **Me:** 嗯嗯。                                                                                                                                              | **Me:** Mm-hmm.                                                                                                                                                                       |

| **Interviewee:** 嗨，嗯...關心方法不是，還好，還好。嗯。我會注意這個，就是因為小時候就常講說那個，如果一個東西啊，最好要在自己，就是自己的家這樣子買，這樣子就不會比較高。然後聽懂的話是還好啦，但是有時候會注意。 | **Interviewee:** Hi, hmm... caring about the method, no, it's okay, it's okay. Hmm. I pay attention to this, because when I was young, people often said that, if there's an item, it's best to buy it in your own, like your own home area, that way it won't be higher. So, if understood, it's okay, but sometimes I do pay attention. |
| **Me:** 嗯嗯。                                                                                                                                              | **Me:** Mm-hmm.                                                                                                                                                                       |

| **Interviewee:** 我覺得這個的重點應該是下面這個嘛，就是公司整體的評分是多少啊，一直在高還是不太高。 | **Interviewee:** I think the main point of this should be the part below, right? Which is the company's overall rating, ah, whether it's consistently high or not too high. |

| **Interviewer:** 對對。但一切的這個系列會影響你的，你的想法嗎？ | **Interviewer:** Right, right. But does this whole series affect your, your thoughts? |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯，還好。因為像鞋子的話，我就主要還是以穿起來要舒服為主啊。 | **Interviewee:** Um, it's okay. Because for shoes, my main focus is still primarily on comfort when wearing them. |
| **Interviewer:** 所以除非這些品牌可能有一些那個... | **Interviewer:** So unless these brands might have some of that... |

| **Interviewee:** 嗯...他在講應該是就是這雙鞋製作的時候的一些，它的用料或者是它的環保問題比較嚴重的汙染問題。                                                      | **Interviewee:** Hmm...

| **Interviewee:** 嗯...就是它有這個「材料可續性、可持續性」，就是他會跟你講說這雙鞋，呃，這材質的，的那個可續、可持續性，就是你會比較了解，就是如果你買了這雙鞋之後，他能，他可能對環境不太好，這樣。 | **Interviewee:** Hmm... It has this "Material Sustainability, Sustainability", meaning it will tell you about this pair of shoes, uh, this material's, its sustainability, sustainability, so you'll understand better, like if you buy this pair of shoes, it can, it might not be good for the environment, like that. |

| **Interviewer:** 這個產品？ | **Interviewer:** This product? |
| **Interviewee:** 沒有買過。 | **Interviewee:** Haven't bought it. |
| **Interviewee:** 所以說我還在比價那邊。我自己個人會覺得說，如果他要再買的話，他可能可以再多一點像是它的價格的部分，它價格可以去跟其他的品牌或其他產品去做比價，或是有一個評分，或是什麼樣的說法。 | **Interviewee:** So I'm still in the price comparison stage. Personally, I feel that if I were to buy it, maybe there could be a bit more, like regarding the price part, its price could be compared with other brands or other products, or have a rating, or some kind of description. |
| **Interviewer:** 那它的上面還有三個按鈕。你先看第一個（黃色）。 | **Interviewer:** Then there are three buttons at the top. Look at the first one first (yellow). |
| **Interviewer:** 好，那你覺得這個內容裡面的重點是什麼？ | **Interviewer:** Okay, what do you think is the key point of this content? |

| **Interviewee:** 環保。 | **Interviewee:** Eco-friendly. |
| **Interviewee:** 這個公司...總體評分45...所以是在看你這個產品的環保程度啊？ | **Interviewee:** This company... overall rating 45... so is it looking at the eco-friendliness level of this product? |
| **Interviewer:** 嗯嗯。 | **Interviewer:** Mhm. |
| **Interviewee:** (Reads) ...減少碳排量38%...這也是... | **Interviewee:** (Reads) ...reduces carbon emissions by 38%... this is also... |
| **Interviewee:** 哦，這是推薦我可以買哪一個品牌。 | **Interviewee:** Oh, this recommends which brand I could buy. |
| **Interviewer:** 嗯。其他的品牌你有買過嗎？還是...？ | **Interviewer:** Um. Have you bought the other brands? Or...? |
| **Interviewee:** 這個（Adidas）有。OK。其他我沒有。 | **Interviewee:** This one (Adidas), yes. OK. The others, no. |
| **Interviewer:** 那你為什麼還是會買（Adidas）？ | **Interviewer:** Then why would you still buy (Adidas)? |
| **Interviewee:** 因為我會買那種二手啊。這個東西...他們的...他們的東西很多在二手... | **Interviewee:** Because I buy second-hand stuff. This thing... their... a lot of their stuff is available second-hand... |

| **Interviewee:** 股票...哦，它還有這個...這邊看那個股票。 | **Interviewee:** Stocks... oh, it also has this... look at the stocks here. |
| **Interviewer:** 嗯。那你最近有買過股票嗎？ | **Interviewer:** Um. Have you bought stocks recently? |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯...沒有。 | **Interviewee:** Um... no. |
| **Interviewer:** 好。 | **Interviewer:** Okay. |
| **Interviewer:** 好，那你下面有看到兩個按鈕嗎？（尋找替代品 & 跟AI聊聊） | **Interviewer:** Okay, do you see the two buttons below? (Find Alternatives & Chat with AI) |
| **Interviewee:** (Clicks '跟AI聊聊') | **Interviewee:** (Clicks 'Chat with AI') |
| **Interviewer:** 嗯。你可以問它問題。你要問什麼問題都可以，你可以直接打字。 | **Interviewer:** Um. You can ask it questions. You can ask any question, you can just type. |
| **Interviewee:** 任何問題都可以？ | **Interviewee:** Any question? |
| **Interviewer:** 任何問題都可以。 | **Interviewer:** Any question is fine. |
| **Interviewee:** (Types question) | **Interviewee:** (Types question) |
| **Interviewer:** 好，那你對它來說，它的回答、它的重點是什麼？ | **Interviewer:** Okay, for you, its answer, what's its key point? |
| **Interviewee:** 我覺得它可能就是...它那邊的方法的建議是我覺得不錯，但它可以有更多的，像是可以舉例的部分。因為它可能...我剛剛看這邊的話，它可能不太知道說要從哪邊着手。或許可能可以找更多的範例，就是，我覺得。 | **Interviewee:** I think maybe... the method suggestions there are good, I think, but it could have more, like parts with examples. Because maybe... looking here just now, it might not quite know where to start. Maybe it could find more examples, that's what I think. |
| **Interviewer:** 對，好。嗯。那這邊也有一些（建議的）問題，你有很想要問其他的事情嗎？還是還好？ | **Interviewer:** Right, okay. Um. There are also some (suggested) questions here, is there anything else you really want to ask? Or is it okay? |

| **Interviewer:** 比較會是它會在更多專業上的考量，不是偏生活。但是比較關心環保，然後它嵌進在那個Momo的裡面。 | **Interviewer:** It's more likely that it has more professional considerations, not leaning towards daily life. But it's more concerned with environmental protection, and it's embedded within Momo. |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯。 | **Interviewee:** Mhm. |
| **Interviewer:** 嗯，對。 | **Interviewer:** Um, right. |
| **Interviewer:** 好，那你覺得（對你來說）最重要的部分，你可以幫我拍照嗎？用你的手機。 | **Interviewer:** Okay, what you feel is the most important part (for you), can you take a photo for me? Use your phone. |
| **Interviewee:** 拍照？ | **Interviewee:** Take a photo? |
| **Interviewer:** 對，拍這個畫面。就是你覺得最重要的部分。 | **Interviewer:** Yes, take a photo of this screen. The part you feel is most important. |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯...（Takes Photo）環保評分。 | **Interviewee:** Um... (Takes Photo) The environmental rating. |
| **Interviewer:** 環保評分？好。 | **Interviewer:** The environmental rating? Okay. |
| **Interviewer:** 好。那它這上面有一個號碼，你可以幫我講出來嗎？這個綠色的號碼。 | **Interviewer:** Okay. There's a number at the top here, can you say it for me? This green number. |

| **Interviewee:** 是告訴你說這個...可能它的材質不好，那你可能不清楚，但這裡寫得很清楚。                                                                        | **Interviewee:** It tells you that this... maybe its material is not good, and you might not know clearly, but it's written very clearly here.                                         |
| **Me:** 嗯。那你看到這個的之後 (註: JSON 誤聽為 的車好)，還是想要買這個產品嗎？                                                                              | **Me:** Hmm. After seeing this (Note: JSON misheard as "this car good"), do you still want to buy this product?                                                                        |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯...他有說到環保的部分嗎？就是說這個是聚酯纖維？                                                                                             | **Interviewee:** Hmm... Did it mention the environmental protection part? Like saying this is polyester fiber?                                                                          |
| **Me:** 他說什麼聚酯纖維好像不是環保的材質。好。這裡有說。                                                                                                  | **Me:** What polyester fiber it says seems not to be an environmentally friendly material. Okay. It says here.                                                                        |
| **Interviewee:** 就是有提醒你說這個東西聚酯纖維還有什麼？這個是化學汙染？好，那我覺得我會再慎重考慮一下。就是因為我買東西本來就不是我看到然後馬上會買，我會想很久。好。那這個給我一個，多一個參考的。 | **Interviewee:** It reminds you that this thing, polyester fiber, and what else? This is chemical pollution? Okay, then I think I will reconsider carefully. Because when I buy things, I don't just buy immediately upon seeing them, I think for a long time. Okay. Then this gives me one, one more reference. |
| **Me:** 啊，上面還有兩個按鈕。                                                                                                                              | **Me:** Ah, there are two more buttons above.                                                                                                                                         |
| **Interviewee:** （點擊按鈕）這個是什麼？                                                                                                                     | **Interviewee:** (Clicks button) What is this?                                                                                                                                        |

| **Interviewee:** 就說如果你不買這個嘛？是這樣的意思？就是說這個東西所會製造的碳排放量。這些會製造地球的...                                                     | **Interviewee:** Meaning if you don't buy this? Is that the meaning? Meaning the carbon emissions this thing will produce. These will produce the Earth's...                             |
| **Me:** 對，這是它的數值嗎？嗯。                                                                                                                            | **Me:** Right, is this its numerical value? Hmm.                                                                                                                                      |
| **Interviewee:** 那這些其他的品牌你有買過 (註: JSON 誤聽為 賣光) 嗎？還是有聽聽過說嘛？                                                                       | **Interviewee:** Then these other brands, have you bought (Note: JSON misheard as "sold out") them? Or have you heard of them?                                                          |
| **Me:** 呃...聽說過。呃...這是什麼？嗯...我以為我英文不好。這個是什麼？Patagonia？                                                                           | **Me:** Uh... heard of them. Uh... What's this? Hmm... I thought my English was bad. What's this? Patagonia?                                                                        |
| **Interviewee:** Patagonia是什麼？我好像沒有，沒有注意那個。                                                                                                  | **Interviewee:** What is Patagonia? I don't seem to have, haven't noticed that one.                                                                                                     |

| **Me:** 好。那最後一個部分呢？這是什麼？                                                                                                                    | **Me:** Okay. What about the last section? What is this?                                                                                                                              |
| **Interviewee:** 最終你買過其他產品的公司？就是說這個？這個是指什麼？我這個有點不懂。                                                                        | **Interviewee:** Finally, the company whose other products you've bought? Meaning this? What does this refer to? I don't quite understand this one.                                     |
| **Me:** 好啊，沒問題。嗯。所以下面還有兩個按鈕，你想要按一個互相聊也可以。                                                                                    | **Me:** Okay, no problem. Hmm. So below there are still two buttons, do you want to press one to chat with each other, that's also okay.                                             |
| **Interviewee:** 我試試看看。                                                                                                                                 | **Interviewee:** Let me try and see.                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Me:** (Participant clicks button) 還有什麼？                                                                                                              | **Me:** (Participant clicks button) What else?                                                                                                                                        |
| **Interviewee:** 「持續」...哦，它給你其他替代的品牌。然後告訴你說這些品牌是比較有，有對環保有幫助的啊。那這個是一個AI幫手，也可以自己問問題。                  | **Interviewee:** "Sustainable"... Oh, it gives you other alternative brands. Then tells you these brands are more, have, are helpful to environmental protection. Ah. Then this is an AI assistant, you can also ask questions yourself. |
| **Me:** 嗯。那有什麼問題想要問嗎？                                                                                                                          | **Me:** Hmm. Do you have any questions you want to ask?                                                                                                                               |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯...沒有。                                                                                                                                  | **Interviewee:** Hmm... No.                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Me:** 想？也可以自己打字 (註: JSON 誤聽為 搭車)。                                                                                                         | **Me:** Think? You can also type yourself (Note: JSON misheard as "take car").                                                                                                        |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯。但我，我想問就是那個品牌...就是它跳出來的那幾個，它推薦的。但是會不會就是，就是變成只固定那幾個品牌？就是畢竟我覺得在做環保的品牌線現在有越來越多，但是還是比較是少數啊。那這樣子會不會就是每次我只要搜尋 (註: TXT 誤聽為 取) 什麼，然後跳出來的都是一樣的，一樣的？會有這個問題喔。 | **Interviewee:** Hmm. But I, I want to ask about that brand... like those few that popped up, the ones it recommended. But will it, will it become fixed to only those few brands? Because after all, I feel that the line of environmentally friendly brands is increasing now, but it's still relatively a minority. Ah. Then in that case, will it be that every time I just search (Note: TXT misheard as "take") for something, the ones that pop up are all the same, the same? There might be this issue. |
| **Me:** 好。                                                                                                                                                | **Me:** Okay.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Me:** 好。那這樣就可以了。手機，你可以使用你的手機掃描這個QR。那下面有一個問卷。那這個測試代碼要就是這些，所以如果你測試一個產品就可以了。但是你因為你測試三個產品，可以寫三個。好。好。謝謝。 | **Me:** Okay. That's fine then. Phone, you can use your phone to scan this QR. Then below there's a questionnaire. And this test code is just these, so if you tested one product, that's fine. But since you tested three products, you can write three. Okay. Okay. Thank you. |
| **Me:** 呃，那你可（以）幫我簽名 (註: JSON 誤聽為 其實) 那個卡片上？寫這個號碼？                                                                              | **Me:** Uh, then can you help me sign (Note: JSON misheard as "actually") that card?

| **Interviewee:** 這裡...「基本上買東西也是一種投資喔！我可以幫你分析你花的錢是支持好公司還是不好的公司。」這個也要唸嗎？                                                                                                                                         | **Interviewee:** Here...

| **Interviewee:** 我覺得我有興趣的是它的這個材料、永續性評估。                                                                                                                                                                           | **Interviewee:** I think what interests me are its materials, sustainability assessment.                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Interviewer:** 嗯。為什麼？                                                                                                                                                                                                  | **Interviewer:** Um.

| **Interviewee:** 因為...呃...好像有一些材質如果不好用的話，可能會有塑化劑或什麼的。然後他這邊有幫我列出來，所以代表說這個產品他沒有。然後如果他用來煮食物的話，應該不會有什麼就是危害人體的東西。                                                                                                                        | **Interviewee:** Because... uh... it seems some materials, if they are not good quality [implying safety], might contain plasticizers or something. And it listed them for me here, so it means this product doesn't have them. And if it's used to cook food, it probably won't have anything harmful to the human body. |

| **Interviewer:** AI 小幫手。那他在說什麼？                                                                                                                                                                                          | **Interviewer:** AI little helper. What is it saying?                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Interviewee:** 他在介紹這一間公司。對，他介紹這間公司它的生產...                                                                                                                                                                      | **Interviewee:** It's introducing this company. Yes, it introduces this company's production...                                                                                                                                                |
| **Interviewer:** 那你覺得這裡介紹裡面的重點是什麼？                                                                                                                                                                                | **Interviewer:** Then what do you think is the main point inside this introduction?                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Interviewee:** 重點應該是跟環境有關的，因為他很多寫永續、環境問題、永續性評級、ESG 評級。對。應該就是主要在講這間公司...等一下，因為聽起來有點大聲，你可以再講一次嗎？                                                                                                                            | **Interviewee:** The main point should be related to the environment, because it writes a lot about sustainability, environmental issues, sustainability rating, ESG rating. Yes. It should mainly be talking about this company... wait, because it sounds a bit loud, can you say it again? |
| **Interviewer:** 好。                                                                                                                                                                                                          | **Interviewer:** Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Interviewee:** 我怕剛剛沒有錄音到。好。我覺得他這個描述感覺比較多著重在這間公司它在環境上的影響。                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewee:** I was afraid it didn't record just now. Okay. I think this description seems to focus more on this company's impact on the environment.                                                                                        |
| **Interviewer:** 好。那你覺得對你來說最重要的點是什麼？                                                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewer:** Okay. Then what do you think is the most important point for you?                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯...最重要...我應該會先看它有沒有負面的，就是對環境有沒有負面的影響。有的話就不會考慮啊。如果就是不確定的話，那我就會以這個產品的功能為主。                                                                                                                            | **Interviewee:** Um... most important... I would probably first see if it has negatives, like if it has a negative impact on the environment. If it does, I won't consider it. If it's just uncertain, then I'll focus on the product's functionality. |
| **Interviewer:** 那你覺得這裡內容裡面有什麼對你來說是新的嗎？你之前不知道的？                                                                                                                                                             | **Interviewer:** Then in the content here, is there anything new for you? That you didn't know before?                                                                                                                                         |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯...新的...我覺得應該一樣，是什麼材料、永續性、環境問題、歷史，然後還有就是他這些...呃...還有勞工問題評級，這些分數還有描述是之前不會知道的事情。                                                                                                                            | **Interviewee:** Um... new... I think it should be the same, what materials, sustainability, environmental issues, history, and also these... uh... also labor issue ratings, these scores and descriptions are things I wouldn't have known before. |
| **Interviewer:** 嗯。那有什麼讓你驚訝的嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                         | **Interviewer:** Um. Was there anything that surprised you?                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| **Interviewee:** 我覺得會考慮耶，就是會考慮。因為像他就友特別講說 All Good 他有使用天然的成分，對，但原本的牌子沒有特別寫。                                                                                                                             | **Interviewee:** I think I would consider, yes, would consider. Because like it specifically mentioned that All Good uses natural ingredients, yes, but the original brand didn't specifically write that.                                             |

| **Interviewer:** 你跟電磁爐的品牌熟嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                            | **Interviewer:** Are you familiar with induction cooker brands?                                                                                                                                                                                |

| **Interviewer:** 就是你之前有買過嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewer:** Like, have you bought it before?                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Interviewee:** 沒有沒有，但就是想買買看。                                                                                                                                                                                        | **Interviewee:** No, no, but I just wanted to buy and try it.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Interviewer:** 那為什麼選剛才選這個呢？                                                                                                                                                                                          | **Interviewer:** Then why did you choose this one just now?                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Interviewee:** 因為他有講到，像如果是買電磁爐的話，我就會看他會不會挑鍋子啊，或者是有沒有特別其他的需求之類的。畢竟是買電器。                                                                                                                                           | **Interviewee:** Because it mentioned, like if I'm buying an induction cooker, I'll check if it's compatible with all pots, or if there are any other special requirements. After all, it's an electrical appliance.                                 |
| **Interviewer:** 那你還是會考慮其他的嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                          | **Interviewer:** Would you still consider others?                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Interviewee:** 還有一個應該是價錢，就是它的價錢是可以接受的，不會太貴。                                                                                                                                                                   | **Interviewee:** Another factor would be the price; its price is acceptable, not too expensive.                                                                                                                                                |
| **Interviewer:** 那其他的重要點是什麼？你覺得這個網頁上最重要的點是什麼？                                                                                                                                                                    | **Interviewer:** What are other important points? What do you think is the most important point on this webpage?                                                                                                                                 |
| **Interviewee:** 這個網頁上最重要的點？嗯...喔，照片，照片。就是它會不會吸引我點進去看。                                                                                                                                                            | **Interviewee:** The most important point on this webpage? Um... Oh, the photos, the photos. Like, whether they attract me to click and look.                                                                                                    |
| **Interviewer:** 好。那還有什麼嗎？重要的？                                                                                                                                                                                        | **Interviewer:** Okay. Is there anything else? That's important?                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Interviewee:** 如果是看網頁的話，我應該會蠻重視就是它容不容易使用。就是我可以很清楚，比如說我現在要找這個東西，我知道它哪裡，比如說它會幫我分類好，這邊就是電器用品，那我就可點進去，然後查之類的。就比較方便我使用。                                                                                                                             | **Interviewee:** If I'm looking at the webpage, I'd probably place importance on how easy it is to use. Like, I can clearly see, for example, if I want to find this item now, I know where it is. For instance, it helps categorize things well, here are the electrical appliances, then I can click in and search, etc. It's more convenient for me to use. |
| **Interviewer:** 那你會看它的評論嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewer:** Do you look at its reviews?                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Interviewee:** 評論還是會小小看一下，但評論我可能會比較偏向去網路上直接看人家...                                                                                                                                                                | **Interviewee:** I'll still briefly look at the reviews, but for reviews, I might be more inclined to go online and directly see what people say...                                                                                             |
| **Interviewer:** 你可以幫我講大聲一點好不好？                                                                                                                                                                                      | **Interviewer:** Could you speak a bit louder, please?                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Interviewee:** 就是如果是評論的話，我應該會比較偏向，比如說我直接再開一個網頁去找人家說有沒有用過這個。                                                                                                                                               | **Interviewee:** Like, if it's about reviews, I'd probably lean towards, for example, opening another webpage directly to find if people say they've used this.                                                                                |
| **Interviewer:** 為什麼呢？                                                                                                                                                                                                    | **Interviewer:** Why is that?                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Interviewee:** 因為有可能他們買這個東西不是在這個平台買的。然後這樣我可以看到比較全面的評論。                                                                                                                                                         | **Interviewee:** Because it's possible they bought this item on a different platform. And this way, I can see more comprehensive reviews.                                                                                                       |
| **Interviewer:** 好。那剛剛那個右邊有一個黃色的部分，你覺得這個是什麼？                                                                                                                                                                       | **Interviewer:** Okay. Just now, there was a yellow section on the right side, what do you think that is?                                                                                                                                       |
| **Interviewee:** 黃色的？這個嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                                | **Interviewee:** Yellow? This one?                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Interviewer:** 對。                                                                                                                                                                                                          | **Interviewer:** Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Interviewee:** 介紹公司、這個產品的... 這個我可能就不太會看，因為我也看不懂。                                                                                                                                                                | **Interviewee:** Introducing the company, this product's... I probably wouldn't look closely at this, because I don't understand it anyway.                                                                                                         |
| **Interviewer:** 哦，看不懂。嗯，OK。那，呃，你幫我看一下，你覺得它裡面有什麼重要的嗎？對你來說？                                                                                                                                                     | **Interviewer:** Oh, don't understand. Um, OK. Then, uh, take a look for me, do you think there's anything important inside it? For you?                                                                                                      |
| **Interviewee:** 重要的可能是...像這個。                                                                                                                                                                                           | **Interviewee:** What might be important is... like this.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Interviewer:** 這個是什麼？                                                                                                                                                                                                  | **Interviewer:** What is this?                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Interviewee:** 塑膠和化學材料。                                                                                                                                                                                                | **Interviewee:** Plastics and chemical materials.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Interviewer:** OK。為什麼這個很重要？                                                                                                                                                                                            | **Interviewer:** OK. Why is this important?                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Interviewee:** 感覺現在的人很重視這方面。就是包含什麼塑化劑啊，或是一些...之前不是有個什麼...什麼懸浮粒子什麼東東？我搞不清楚。反正就是環境方面的。                                                                                                                                    | **Interviewee:** Feels like people nowadays care a lot about this aspect. Including things like plasticizers, or some... wasn't there something before... some suspended particles or something? I'm not clear. Anyway, it's related to the environment. |
| **Interviewer:** OK。那，你覺得這個內容的重點是什麼？                                                                                                                                                                                | **Interviewer:** OK. So, what do you think is the main point of this content?                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Interviewee:** 重點是...這個產品對環境的影響。雖然有受到批評，但他們有...還是已經有在進步了。                                                                                                                                                           | **Interviewee:** The main point is... the environmental impact of this product. Although it has received criticism, they have... they have already been improving.                                                                                 |
| **Interviewer:** 嗯。那下面還有其他的嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                          | **Interviewer:** Um. Are there others below?                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Interviewee:** 下面的就是在講材料，然後產地吧。我覺得產地有些人可能也會看，就是有可能，不是會有人會覺得中國製造的就是品質比較不好之類的。                                                                                                                                    | **Interviewee:** Below it talks about materials, and origin, I guess. I think some people might look at the origin, because it's possible, aren't there people who feel that 'Made in China' means lower quality, etc.                             |
| **Interviewer:** 嗯。那，你覺得其他這個會影響你的想法嗎？                                                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewer:** Um. So, do you think these other things would influence your thoughts?                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Interviewee:** 我可能會看東西。就是如果像我剛剛，因為我剛剛沒有看到這個，如果是電器的話，我可能就會再思考一下，因為有點危險的感覺。                                                                                                                                         | **Interviewee:** I might look at the item itself. Like just now, because I didn't see this earlier, if it's an electrical appliance, I might reconsider, because it feels a bit risky.                                                          |

| **Interviewee:** 這也是在講環境的嗎？現在好像很多人都在注重這個碳排放，就包含氣候變遷啊那些的。                                                                                                                                                           | **Interviewee:** Is this also talking about the environment? It seems like many people are focusing on carbon emissions now, including climate change and those things.                                                                            |

What does the part below say? No, the yellow one from earlier... what do you think these things are?                                                                                                                       |
| **Interviewee:** 這個嗎？不是不是，那個剛剛下面這邊。哦，這些是什麼？這些綠科技？哦哦...然後第三層應該是在告訴我們這個產品，它就是有關碳排放的東西，然後可能怕我們看不懂，所以旁邊很有解釋之類的。                                                                                                                 | **Interviewee:** This one? No no, the one below just now. Oh, what are these? These green technologies? Oh oh... And the third layer is probably telling us about this product, things related to carbon emissions, and maybe because they're afraid we won't understand, there are explanations on the side. |

| **Interviewer:** 那你覺得它的內容怎麼樣呢？                                                                                                                                                                                          | **Interviewer:** What do you think of its content?                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Interviewee:** 我覺得蠻不錯的。因為通常在買股票的時候，還是會看一下公司，當然公司的發展啦。然後它這裡又有圖表，然後又蠻好，就是蠻明顯可以看得出來的。然後又有公司的介紹。然後這邊還有自然方面，因為可能自然方面，就是以後在買股票，自然方面可能也會蠻注重，就有一些比較重視環保的產業可能也會慢慢的股價會上升之類的。                                                                                              | **Interviewee:** I think it's quite good. Because usually when buying stocks, you still look at the company, of course, the company's development. And here it has charts, and they are quite good, quite clear and easy to see. And there's a company introduction. Then there's the nature aspect here, because maybe the nature aspect, like when buying stocks in the future, the nature aspect might also be quite important, some industries that value environmental protection more might see their stock prices rise slowly, etc. |
| **Interviewer:** 那你有現在在考慮買什麼股票嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                    | **Interviewer:** Are you currently considering buying any stocks?                                                                                                                                                                              |

| **Interviewee:** 我應該不會為了買股票特別購入這個東西。但是如果它是，譬如說，我是這個網站的會員，買了會員可以有這個的話，那我會買會員，因為我買東西的同時還可以順便看這個。                                                                                                                               | **Interviewee:** I probably wouldn't specifically get this thing just to buy stocks. But if it was, for example, if I was a member of this website, and buying a membership gave access to this, then I would buy the membership, because while shopping, I could also look at this conveniently. |
| **Interviewer:** 好。那你可以幫我回那個第一個表嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                | **Interviewer:** Okay. Can you help me go back to that first tab/section?                                                                                                                                                                      |

| **Interviewer:** 對。那最下面有按鈕...這樣有按嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                 | **Interviewer:** Right. Then at the very bottom there are buttons... did it register the click?                                                                                                                                                |
| **Interviewee:** 這個嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                                      | **Interviewee:** This one?                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Interviewer:** 啊，你看看...你...啊，有兩個按鈕，你覺得哪一個比較有興趣？                                                                                                                                                                  | **Interviewer:** Ah, take a look... you... ah, there are two buttons, which one are you more interested in?                                                                                                                                     |
| **Interviewee:** (Clicks button)                                                                                                                                                                                               | **Interviewee:** (Clicks button)                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Interviewer:** 啊，你剛剛...你幫我講出來，你剛剛按什麼按鈕？                                                                                                                                                                            | **Interviewer:** Ah, you just... tell me, what button did you just press?                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Interviewee:** 我剛剛是按替代產品。                                                                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewee:** I just pressed "Alternative Products".                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Interviewer:** 好。那為什麼你選這個按鈕呢？                                                                                                                                                                                      | **Interviewer:** Okay. Why did you choose this button?                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Interviewee:** 因為可能這個產品我剛點進來的時候，我覺得他還可以有更好的地方。比如說我考慮的點可能會是，假設我剛剛是因為他的價格進來的的話，結果我發現我進來之後發現他使用的可能方法比較複雜啊，或者是像剛剛那個產地的問題。所以我就會想要看一下有沒有跟他差不多，然後可以替代他的。                                                                                                                 | **Interviewee:** Because maybe when I first clicked on this product, I felt there could be better aspects. For example, the points I consider might be, suppose I came in because of its price, but then after entering, I found that its usage might be more complicated, or like the origin issue just mentioned. So I would want to see if there's something similar to it that can replace it. |
| **Interviewer:** 好。那你可以幫我按那個...嗯...對。那，嗯，你有什麼問題你想要問他嗎？就是看到這個...呃...你有什麼問題你想要問嗎？                                                                                                                                  | **Interviewer:** Okay. Can you press that... um... right. So, um, do you have any questions you want to ask it? Seeing this... uh... do you have any questions you want to ask?                                                                    |
| **Interviewee:** 我應該會想要問他，就是請他直接給我可以替代的產品。就他跟我講，他是跟我講品牌的，但品牌裡面的電磁鍋可能還是有很多種。我會跟他講我的需求，然後請他能不能幫我找到。                                                                                                                             | **Interviewee:** I would probably want to ask it, like, ask it to directly give me alternative products. Like it told me, it told me brands, but within the brands, there might still be many types of induction cookers. I would tell it my needs, and ask if it can help me find one. |
| **Interviewer:** 好。那你可幫我打字嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                            | **Interviewer:** Okay. Can you type that for me?                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Interviewee:** (Types) 完成。好。                                                                                                                                                                                             | **Interviewee:** (Types) Done. Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Interviewer:** 那你覺得這個內容有什麼重要的嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                    | **Interviewer:** Do you think this content is important in any way?                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯...就是因為像剛剛上面這邊，他...我重視的點可能是有沒有不挑鍋，但他沒有寫到，所以我又特別問他。然後他這邊也直接跟我講說他有不挑鍋的設計，然後包含他的優點。然後我可能就想要問他他有什麼缺點之類的，就讓我的那個挑選的時候方便，更全面一點。                                                                                                                | **Interviewee:** Um... because like above just now, it... the point I cared about was maybe whether it's compatible with all pots, but it didn't mention that, so I specifically asked it. And then here it directly told me it has a design compatible with all pots, including its advantages. Then I might want to ask it about its disadvantages, etc., just to make my selection process more convenient and comprehensive. |
| **Interviewer:** 好。那你可幫我使用你的手機拍照這個部分？然後還有你知道這裡的裡面最重要的地方在哪裡？                                                                                                                                                     | **Interviewer:** Okay. Can you use your phone to take a photo of this part?

| **Interviewee:** 就是這個本身產品的畫面，跟價格有寫清楚。                                                                                                                                                                           | **Interviewee:** Just the image of the product itself, and that the price is clearly written.                                                                                                                                                  |

| **Interviewee:** 評論的話，我覺得...我覺得 momo 的評論我會比較...可能我沒有很常用 momo，所以我沒有很知道，就是它的評論好像都會想要可以往下滑就找到。                                                                                                                                 | **Interviewee:** For reviews, I think... I think momo's reviews I would more... maybe because I don't use momo very often, so I don't really know, it seems like its reviews, you'd want to be able to just scroll down and find them.               |
| **Interviewer:** 嗯。那是不太會看評論？                                                                                                                                                                                            | **Interviewer:** Um.

| **Interviewee:** 評論的話嗎？會看會看，會希望有實體的圖片，就是別人購買後，就是買家購買後的那個實體的，實體的樣品這樣。                                                                                                                                           | **Interviewee:** Reviews? I do look, I do look. I hope there are real photos, like after someone else buys it, the buyer's actual, actual sample photos like that.                                                                           |
| **Interviewer:** 那評論的話，你是比較相信那個 momo 上的評論，還是在其他的平台上的評論？                                                                                                                                                          | **Interviewer:** For reviews, do you trust the reviews on momo more, or reviews on other platforms?                                                                                                                                              |
| **Interviewee:** 比起蝦皮那些嘛，我覺得會比較相信 momo。                                                                                                                                                                             | **Interviewee:** Compared to Shopee and those, I think I trust momo more.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Interviewer:** 哦，為什麼呢？                                                                                                                                                                                                | **Interviewer:** Oh, why is that?                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Interviewee:** 因為...呃...蝦皮感覺有很...比較方便，就是買家的...呃...賣家的身份確認上好像比 momo 的還容易一些，所以比較容易買到就是比較...呃...不符合圖片的一些商品的感覺。好好。                                                                                                                       | **Interviewee:** Because... uh... Shopee feels very... convenient, meaning the buyer's... uh... the seller's identity verification seems easier than momo's, so it's easier to buy things that are more... uh... don't match the pictures. Okay okay. |
| **Interviewer:** 你可以幫我...去上面？好。剛剛那個右邊有一個黃色的地方？黃色的部分。這個。好。你覺得這個是什麼？                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewer:** Can you help me... go up? Okay. Just now on the right side, there was a yellow area? The yellow part. This one. Okay. What do you think this is?                                                                                |
| **Interviewee:** 這個是...呃...就是關於產品的一些資料，跟品牌的資料跟內容嘛。                                                                                                                                                            | **Interviewee:** This is... uh... just some information about the product, and the brand's information and content.                                                                                                                             |
| **Interviewer:** 那你覺得他講的，呃，有什麼重要的嗎？                                                                                                                                                                               | **Interviewer:** Do you think what it says, uh, is important in any way?                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Interviewee:** 你說這有什麼重要的嗎？嗯...了解一個產品本身的品牌能夠讓我們更知道這個產品本身對我們的效果是不是好的，然後是不是我們想要買到的材質，跟品牌本身給的信用也會比較有保障的感覺，會比較願意下單。                                                                                                            | **Interviewee:** You mean is this important? Um... Understanding the brand of a product itself allows us to know better if the product itself will be effective for us, and if it's the material we want to buy. And the credit given by the brand itself also feels more guaranteed, making one more willing to place an order. |
| **Interviewer:** 嗯。那你會覺得這個內容是關於這個產品嗎？                                                                                                                                                                             | **Interviewer:** Um. Do you feel this content is about this product?                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Interviewee:** 對對。                                                                                                                                                                                                        | **Interviewee:** Yes, yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Interviewer:** 那跟這個產品有關係嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                            | **Interviewer:** Is it related to this product?                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Interviewee:** 跟這個產品有關係嗎？有。因為他有講到蠻多關於產品本身的，就是製造的...呃...國家，然後還有用的材料。我覺得是會想要...呃...買家買東西之前會想要先知道是哪裡出產的。                                                                                                                             | **Interviewee:** Related to this product? Yes. Because it mentioned quite a bit about the product itself, like the manufacturing... uh... country, and also the materials used. I think buyers would want to know where it's produced before buying. |
| **Interviewer:** 好，OK。那你可以幫我看第二個部分嗎？                                                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewer:** Okay, OK. Can you look at the second section for me?                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Interviewee:** 第二個部分？嗯。                                                                                                                                                                                                | **Interviewee:** The second section? Um.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Interviewer:** 有看到嗎？第...這個嗎？呃，上面一點。你看，你有發現有...有三個部分嗎？                                                                                                                                                           | **Interviewer:** Did you see it? The... this one? Uh, a bit higher. Look, did you notice there are... three sections?                                                                                                                           |
| **Interviewee:** 有。                                                                                                                                                                                                          | **Interviewee:** Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Interviewer:** 好。這個是什麼？                                                                                                                                                                                                | **Interviewer:** Okay.

| **Interviewee:** 哦...問你幹嘛來著？就是...呃...就是這個東西本身，產品對於環境的影響，就是有沒有環保的效果嘛。                                                                                                                                       | **Interviewee:** Oh... what was I asking you? It's... uh... just this thing itself, the product's impact on the environment, like whether it has environmental effects.                                                                           |
| **Interviewer:** 嗯。哦。那這些其他的品牌你有看過嗎？                                                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewer:** Um. Oh. Have you seen these other brands before?                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Interviewee:** 你說...嗯...好像有聽過這個。哦，但沒有很熟。                                                                                                                                                                           | **Interviewee:** You mean... um... I think I've heard of this one. Oh, but not familiar.                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Interviewer:** 那是你覺得它是做安全帽的嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                      | **Interviewer:** Do you think it makes helmets?                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Interviewee:** 感覺不只會有安全帽，感覺會跟很多其他我沒有想像得到，但好像不會只是安全帽的品牌，聽起來也不像。                                                                                                                                      | **Interviewee:** Feels like it's not just helmets, feels like it's related to many other things I wouldn't have imagined, but it seems like it wouldn't just be a helmet brand, doesn't sound like it either.                                          |
| **Interviewer:** 那你是覺得是真的還是假的呢？                                                                                                                                                                                      | **Interviewer:** Do you think it's real or fake?                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Interviewee:** 你說這邊的品牌資訊嗎？我會相信是真的。                                                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewee:** You mean the brand information here? I would believe it's real.                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Interviewer:** 好。那第三個部分呢？那我還是問你，為什麼你覺得是真的？                                                                                                                                                                    | **Interviewer:** Okay. What about the third section? Then let me ask again, why do you think it's real?                                                                                                                                        |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯...因為覺得他寫得算蠻清楚的，然後也不只提供一個品牌，是提供了不同品牌來做比較，然後也有解釋到原因，所以我會覺得是真的，會相信看看。                                                                                                                            | **Interviewee:** Um... because I feel it's written quite clearly, and it doesn't just provide one brand, it provides different brands for comparison, and also explains the reasons, so I would feel it's real, I would believe it and take a look. |
| **Interviewer:** 好，OK。那第三個部分是什麼？                                                                                                                                                                                     | **Interviewer:** Okay, OK. What is the third section?                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Interviewee:** 第三個部分是投資。                                                                                                                                                                                                | **Interviewee:** The third section is investment.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Interviewer:** 投資，好。那你之前有投資過嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                    | **Interviewer:** Investment, okay. Have you invested before?                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Interviewee:** 沒有。                                                                                                                                                                                                        | **Interviewee:** No.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Interviewer:** 那你覺得如果你喜歡一個產品，那你想要投資那個公司嗎？                                                                                                                                                                    | **Interviewer:** Do you think if you like a product, would you want to invest in that company?                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Interviewee:** 你說喜歡這個產品的話，會想要投資這個公司嗎？目前的話會沒有想。嗯...如果年紀可能再一兩年可能會想到。                                                                                                                                  | **Interviewee:** You mean if I like this product, would I want to invest in this company? Right now, I wouldn't think so. Um... if maybe in another year or two, I might think about it.                                                         |
| **Interviewer:** 那我的意思是，賣東西跟投資有什麼關係嗎？還是是完全不一樣的？                                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewer:** What I mean is, is there any relationship between selling things and investing? Or are they completely different?                                                                                                                |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯...我覺得是完全不一樣的。                                                                                                                                                                                       | **Interviewee:** Um... I think they are completely different.                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| **Interviewee:** 喔...它是有環保爭議的品牌喔？不知道這件事耶。                                                                                                                                                                         | **Interviewee:** Oh... it's a brand with environmental controversies? I didn't know about this.                                                                                                                                                |

Huh? For you? Or is there anything you didn't know before?                                                                                                               |
| **Interviewee:** 之前不知道的是，我之前不知道他居然是有環保爭議的品牌。然後這邊的話，可能會看一下這邊。對我重要的話...這個。                                                                                                                                     | **Interviewee:** What I didn't know before is, I didn't know it was actually a brand with environmental controversies. Then here, I might look at this part. If it's important to me... this one.                                                   |

| **Interviewee:** 就是可能...對不起...可能對於...就是我要買這個東西，然後我之後可能要做一些回收啊等等的，然後它也對環境有一些不太好的影響，就會影響我繼續購買這個品牌的東西。                                                                                                                            | **Interviewee:** Just maybe... sorry... maybe for... like I want to buy this thing, and then later I might need to do some recycling, etc., and it also has some not-so-good impacts on the environment, that would affect whether I continue to buy things from this brand. |
| **Interviewer:** 嗯。好。那你...你看可以幫我看第二個部分一下？                                                                                                                                                                       | **Interviewer:** Um. Okay. Can you... look, can you help me look at the second section?                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Interviewee:** 好。                                                                                                                                                                                                          | **Interviewee:** Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Interviewer:** 你覺得這個是什麼？                                                                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewer:** What do you think this is?                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Interviewee:** 這個...這邊是...等一下...什麼？好...這邊應該是他的化學成分嗎？品牌名稱。好。然後檢判...這個部分，他的潛力嗎？因為現在很多企業都在注重永續，然後他們沒有繼續在做一些環保產品的話，可能會對環境造成汙染，然後消費者也可能會去抵制他們的產品。                                                                                                  | **Interviewee:** This... this part is... wait... what? Okay... this part should be its chemical ingredients? Brand name. Okay. Then review... this section, its potential? Because many companies now focus on sustainability, and if they don't continue to make some environmentally friendly products, it might pollute the environment, and consumers might also boycott their products. |
| **Interviewer:** 嗯。那你自己你會考慮這些其他的品牌嗎？                                                                                                                                                                            | **Interviewer:** Um. Would you personally consider these other brands?                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Interviewee:** 其他的品牌？如果我在這邊這個測驗中看到這些，我可能會回去想要查一下，可能會考慮這些品牌。                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewee:** Other brands? If I saw these here in this test, I might go back and want to look them up, might consider these brands.                                                                                                         |
| **Interviewer:** 那你之前有看過這些品牌嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                      | **Interviewer:** Have you seen these brands before?                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Interviewee:** 沒有耶。                                                                                                                                                                                                      | **Interviewee:** No.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Interviewer:** 那如果你...嗯...有什麼問題嗎？想要問什麼嗎？關於這些品牌？                                                                                                                                                             | **Interviewer:** Then if you... um... do you have any questions? Want to ask anything? About these brands?                                                                                                                                      |
| **Interviewee:** 這些品牌...嗯...我也想要看他們...嗯...因為我現在知道他們這些已經對環境有減少一些汙染，那之後可能就會想要繼續看他們的口紅的品牌，品牌的色號出的符不符合標準，然後再來我可以看一下他的外觀是否符合我的期待，可以帶出門的期待。嗯。然後它的價格。                                                                                                   | **Interviewee:** These brands... um... I'd also want to see them... um... because I now know these have already reduced some pollution to the environment, so later I might want to continue looking at their lipstick brands, whether the shades released meet standards, and then I can look at its appearance to see if it meets my expectations, expectations for carrying it out. Um. And its price. |

| **Interviewer:** 你之前有投資過嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewer:** Have you invested before?                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Interviewee:** 沒有，我沒有投資過耶。                                                                                                                                                                                            | **Interviewee:** No, I haven't invested.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Interviewer:** 那你覺得如果你有買過這個品牌，你會想要投資這個公司嗎？如果你覺得這個品牌是好品牌？                                                                                                                                                  | **Interviewer:** Then do you think if you had bought from this brand, would you want to invest in this company? If you feel this brand is a good brand?                                                                                          |
| **Interviewee:** 是好品牌...我如果是好品牌，我才會願意投資他們。但是依我剛剛看，他們對於...呃...環保議題已經有些問題了，而且如果大眾知道這些東西的話，可能會考慮購買其他品牌選擇，就是減少選擇他們的品牌。所以我覺我可能不太會投資他們。                                                                                                        | **Interviewee:** Is it a good brand... If it's a good brand, only then would I be willing to invest in them. But based on what I just saw, they already have some issues with... uh... environmental topics, and if the public knows about these things, they might consider buying other brands, meaning reducing the choice of their brand. So I think I probably wouldn't invest in them much. |
| **Interviewer:** 嗯。那投資不是為了賺錢嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                        | **Interviewer:** Um. Isn't investment for making money?                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Interviewee:** 投資不是為了賺錢嗎？可是...呃...如果我剛剛看那樣的話，他們再持續做同樣的事情的話，股價就會下跌，我這樣也不會賺錢啊。                                                                                                                             | **Interviewee:** Isn't investment for making money? But... uh... if based on what I just saw, if they continue doing the same things, the stock price will fall, and I won't make money that way either.                                            |
| **Interviewer:** 嗯。好。那第一個部分，最...最下面...呃，第一個部分...呃，抱歉。最下面有按鈕，你想要按一個嗎？                                                                                                                                     | **Interviewer:** Um. Okay. Then the first section, the very... bottom... uh, the first section... uh, sorry. At the very bottom there are buttons, do you want to press one?                                                                      |

What does it say?                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Interviewee:** 呃...好。他說以下是 Maybelline 跟其他更具有可持續性的化妝品品牌的比較表。然後他給出的除了 Maybelline，還有資生堂，他有減少包裝物、動物試驗，然後對於可持續發展計畫有積極的推行。他們也沒有動物實驗，然後包裝廢棄物也較低，有更多可持續的選擇。然後露華濃，減少包裝物試驗，也沒有動物的試驗，然後積極推行可持續發展計劃，沒有動物試驗，然後同樣跟資生堂一樣，沒有...包裝廢棄物也更低...有更多可持續選擇。然後這個...Ilia？應該也是。 | **Interviewee:** Uh... okay. It says below is a comparison table of Maybelline and other more sustainable cosmetics brands. Then besides Maybelline, it gives Shiseido, which has reduced packaging waste, animal testing, and actively promotes sustainable development plans. They also don't have animal testing, and packaging waste is lower, with more sustainable options. Then Revlon, reduced packaging waste testing, also no animal testing, and actively promotes sustainable development plans, no animal testing, and similarly to Shiseido, no... packaging waste is also lower... more sustainable options. Then this... Ilia? Probably also. |
| **Interviewer:** 你覺得這裡有什麼對你來說重要的資料嗎？                                                                                                                                                                            | **Interviewer:** Do you think there's any important information here for you?                                                                                                                                                                  |

Like, you can choose, if you feel something is important, in which part?                                                                                                                                  |
| **Interviewee:** 我蠻看重這個耶，動物實驗的。因為我覺得我蠻喜歡小動物的，所以我對於一些...而且我看過一些就是用動物測試實驗的，我覺得都不太好。所以我蠻看重這個。我覺得有動物的實驗我都盡量不太會買他們。                                                                                                             | **Interviewee:** I care quite a bit about this one, animal testing. Because I feel I quite like small animals, so for some... and I've seen some that use animals for testing experiments, I feel they are not very good. So I care a lot about this. I feel if there's animal testing, I try my best not to buy from them. |

| **Interviewee:** 我問我買的產品裡有沒有對我身體有害化學物質。嗯。然後他說，要了解你購買的產品中是否含有化學物質，可以查看產品的成分標籤或是產品的數位產品護照，這通常會提供詳細的成分跟 ESG 數據。                                                                                                                       | **Interviewee:** I asked if the product I bought contains any harmful chemical substances for my body. Um. Then it said, to understand if the product you purchased contains chemical substances, you can check the product's ingredient label or the product's digital product passport, which usually provides detailed ingredients and ESG data. |
| **Interviewer:** 嗯。那還有待會問你的問題嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                      | **Interviewer:** Um.

| **Interviewee:** 還要問別的問題嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewee:** Need to ask other questions?                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Interviewer:** 不是，他剛剛不是問一個問題嗎？我可以幫你查看數位產品護照？                                                                                                                                                               | **Interviewer:** No, didn't it just ask a question? I can help you check the digital product passport?                                                                                                                                          |

| **Interviewer:** 那這個...這個都是假的，它跟這個產品沒有關係。但是基本上這個想法是，如果...如果一個產品，那個產品可以有一個護照...這個基本上是假的。它...什麼樣的產品...你知道這個嗎？你知道有一些產品有護照嗎？                                                                                                                 | **Interviewer:** Then this... this is all fake, it's not related to this product.

Do you know some products have passports? |
| **Interviewee:** 有，我知道這個東西。                                                                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewee:** Yes, I know about this thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| **Interviewee:** 產地、成分，然後我也想看剛剛那個有沒有動物試驗。嗯...還有什麼...我想一下喔。有些有永續標章，我覺得有沒有永續標章可以標出來。嗯，大概就這樣。                                                                                                                           | **Interviewee:** Origin, ingredients, then I also want to see that one just now about animal testing. Um... what else... let me think. Some have sustainability labels, I think whether it has a sustainability label could be marked. Um, probably just that. |
| **Interviewer:** 好。那這樣就可以了。那你可以幫我回那個原本的地方？它最上面有一個代碼。這個綠色的代碼。你可以幫我講出來嗎？                                                                                                                                        | **Interviewer:** Okay. Then that's fine. Can you help me go back to the original place? At the very top, there's a code. This green code. Can you say it out loud for me?                                                                          |
| **Interviewee:** 綠...就是這個？這個代碼？喔...B-P-D-S-A。                                                                                                                                                                       | **Interviewee:** Green... just this one? This code? Oh... B-P-D-S-A.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Interviewer:** 好。那你可以幫我寫在卡片上？那你覺得最重要的部分是什麼？你可以幫我拍照一張？                                                                                                                                                      | **Interviewer:** Okay. Can you help me write it on the card? Then what do you think is the most important part? Can you take one photo for me?                                                                                                 |
| **Interviewee:** 最重要？嗯。                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **Interviewee:** Most important? Um.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Interviewer:** 可以用你的手機拍照。                                                                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewer:** You can use your phone to take the photo.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Interviewee:** 這邊？為什麼？這邊？欸...就是我剛剛，我覺得這麼...我對於這個我蠻驚訝的，因為我一直都不知道 Maybelline 是這種品牌，就嚇到我。                                                                                                                            | **Interviewee:** Here? Why? Here? Eh... just now, I felt this... I was quite surprised by this, because I never knew Maybelline was this kind of brand, it shocked me.                                                                          |
| **Interviewer:** 你講出來一下。                                                                                                                                                                                                  | **Interviewer:** Say it out loud briefly.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Interviewee:** 呃...Maybelline 過去受環保爭議，包括包裝廢棄物跟動物試驗問題。然後這件事讓我蠻驚訝的，因為我一直以為 Maybelline 沒有做出這種事情，所以我之前都會買他們商品。但是可能看過這個之後，我就會對要買他們商品這件事再考慮一下。                                                                                                | **Interviewee:** Uh... Maybelline has faced environmental controversies in the past, including packaging waste and animal testing issues. Then this matter surprised me quite a bit, because I always thought Maybelline didn't do this kind of thing, so I used to buy their products. But maybe after seeing this, I will reconsider buying their products. |
| **Interviewer:** 好，謝謝。                                                                                                                                                                                                    | **Interviewer:** Okay, thank you.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| **Interviewer:** 好。基本上我是建功大學創意設計所的學生，然後這個是我的論文的一部分，那個環保的 app。那等一下我們會測試這個 app，然後之後還有一個問卷。好。那第一個問題是，你會網路上買東西嗎？                                                                                                                                                                   | **Interviewer:** Okay.

| **Interviewee:** 呃...有興趣的？請問是會影響到我買這個商品的哪一部分會比較影響到我買商品的原因嗎？                                                                                                                                                 | **Interviewee:** Uh... interested in?

| **Interviewee:** 呃...可能是第一個吧。因為投資可能跟這個...這個公司的未來的股價可能跟我買這個商品沒有太大的關聯，所以我可能會看第一個買東西。因為它有很明確的指出這個商品它不太環保，然後就跟...就是可能我以後再看其他的商品之後會比較考慮到環保的部分。因為平常買東西不太會考慮環保的部分。但是如果其他的品牌沒有那麼好看，可能還是會考慮一下，會平衡一下。對，因為現在應該還沒有聽過。                                                                                             | **Interviewee:** Uh... maybe the first one. Because investment might be related to this... this company's future stock price might not have much connection to me buying this product, so I might look at the first one about buying things. Because it very clearly pointed out that this product is not very environmentally friendly, and then... just maybe when I look at other products in the future, I will consider the environmental aspect more. Because normally when buying things, I don't really consider the environmental part. But if other brands don't look as good, I might still consider it, balance it out. Yes, because I probably haven't heard of them yet. |

| **Interviewee:** 他說 Nike 的 Dunk 鞋型主要採用人工皮革還有聚酯纖維，這些材料通常來自於化石產品，對環境影響較大。然後這些產品的生產過程中常常會有汙染排放。                                                                                                                            | **Interviewee:** It says Nike's Dunk shoe style mainly uses artificial leather and polyester fiber.

| **Me:** 那這個內容的裡面，最重要的部分在哪裡？                                                                                                              | **Me:** Within this content, what is the most important part?                                                                                                         |
| **Interviewee:** 應該是這個吧...「雖然Dior (註: TXT 誤聽為 dial) 有使用可持續材料的承諾，但ESG評分仍偏低」這樣。                                                | **Interviewee:** Probably this one... "Although Dior (Note: TXT misheard as dial) has committed to using sustainable materials, its ESG rating remains low," like that. |
| **Me:** 為什麼這個重要？                                                                                                                                    | **Me:** Why is this important?                                                                                                                                        |
| **Interviewee:** 因為就是，嗯，就是有它好的部分嘛，跟不太好的結果，這樣子。嗯。                                                                               | **Interviewee:** Because, well, hmm, it has its good parts, right, and the not-so-good results, like that. Hmm.                                                 |
| **Me:** 好。那妳可以幫我開那個第二個部分嗎？第二個部分，妳覺得這個是什麼？                                                                                  | **Me:** Okay. Can you open the second section for me? The second section, what do you think this is?                                                                |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯...這個是，喔，它會告訴我，呃，如果我不買的話，就可以類似保護環境多少的那種感覺，或者是會有怎麼樣的影響，這樣。                               | **Interviewee:** Hmm... This is, oh, it tells me, uh, if I don't buy it, it's like a feeling of protecting the environment to some extent, or what kind of impact it would have, like that. |
| **Me:** 那下面這些是什麼？                                                                                                                                  | **Me:** What are these below?                                                                                                                                         |
| **Interviewee:** 那一些比起這個牌子，然後對於環保更重要...更有致力於環保的品牌。嗯。                                                                        | **Interviewee:** Those are brands that, compared to this one, are more important for environmental protection... more committed to environmental protection. Hmm. |
| **Me:** 那這些其他的品牌妳有買過嗎？                                                                                                                        | **Me:** Have you bought these other brands before?                                                                                                                    |
| **Interviewee:** 有，我有買過Aveda (註: TXT 誤聽為 avenda)。                                                                                                   | **Interviewee:** Yes, I have bought Aveda (Note: TXT misheard as avenda).                                                                                             |
| **Me:** OK。妳覺得怎麼樣？                                                                                                                                  | **Me:** OK. What do you think of it?                                                                                                                                  |
| **Interviewee:** 我覺得還不錯啊，我覺得它的東西是好的。                                                                                                     | **Interviewee:** I think it's quite good, I think their products are good.                                                                                            |
| **Me:** 好。那看到這個會影響妳的想法嗎？妳會考慮買其他的品牌嗎？                                                                                              | **Me:** Okay. Does seeing this influence your thoughts? Would you consider buying other brands?                                                                       |
| **Interviewee:** 會，我會考慮買其他的品牌。但，呃...我覺得還是要有...他們要有，怎麼講，相同的性質嗎？這樣子。我覺得，因為我覺得化妝品的可替代性不一定有那麼大。如果我很在乎這個產品，因為像，其實像Dior的唇膏，它其實是高價位的嘛。我今天在選擇買高價位的東西的時候，可能代表 (註: TXT 誤聽為 代錶) 著它背後有我想要的東西，例如說：一、我想要拿著，呃，因為類似我想要拿著名牌的東西之類的；然後二、就是這個東西它足夠那麼好，讓我願意花那麼多的價格。所以其實像其他的品牌的話，除非它有達到我這兩個需求跟想法，不然我可能不會輕易地做替代。 | **Interviewee:** Yes, I would consider buying other brands. But, uh... I feel there still needs to be... they need to have, how should I put it, similar characteristics? Like that. I feel, because I think the substitutability of cosmetics isn't necessarily that high. If I really care about this product, because like, actually like Dior lipstick, it's high-priced, right? When I choose to buy high-priced items today, it might represent (Note: TXT misheard) that behind it, there's something I want, for example: one, I want to hold, uh, because it's like I want to hold designer items, things like that; and two, this item is good enough that I'm willing to pay such a high price. So actually, for other brands, unless they meet these two needs and thoughts of mine, otherwise I probably wouldn't easily substitute. |
| **Me:** 好。然後妳幫我開第三個部分。好，妳覺得這個是什麼？                                                                                                  | **Me:** Okay. Then help me open the third section. Okay, what do you think this is?                                                                                  |
| **Interviewee:** 這個...「你可以購買過去」喔？這是代號？這是什麼意思啊？可以追蹤你購買的產品的公司？這都是這個品牌的，是嗎？都是這個品牌的。對。那為什麼代號不一樣？喔，產地不一樣是嗎？ | **Interviewee:** This... "You can buy past" huh? Is this a code? What does this mean? Can track the company of the products you bought? Are these all from this brand? All from this brand. Right. Then why are the codes different? Oh, is the place of origin different? |
| **Me:** 兩個不同的國家。對，兩個不同。可以投資這個品牌。嗯，對。那妳之前有投資過嗎？                                                                        | **Me:** Two different countries. Yes, two different ones. You can invest in this brand. Hmm, yes. Have you invested before?                                             |
| **Interviewee:** 我之前沒有投資過這兩個品牌。                                                                                                               | **Interviewee:** I haven't invested in these two brands before.                                                                                                       |
| **Me:** 有接觸 (註: TXT 誤聽為 金屬) 投資嗎？妳說股票那種嗎？對。妳說妳有做過投資這件事嗎？                                                                   | **Me:** Have you had contact with (Note: TXT misheard as "metal") investing? You mean stocks? Yes. You mean have you done investing before?                 |
| **Interviewee:** 有，有。但我沒有投資過這個品牌。對。                                                                                                       | **Interviewee:** Yes, yes. But I haven't invested in this brand. Right.                                                                                             |
| **Me:** 那妳有投資過是台灣的公司還是國外？                                                                                                                  | **Me:** Have you invested in Taiwanese companies or foreign ones?                                                                                                   |
| **Interviewee:** 我投資過台灣跟國外的都有。OK。嗯。                                                                                                         | **Interviewee:** I've invested in both Taiwanese and foreign ones. OK. Hmm.                                                                                         |
| **Me:** 那妳覺得買 (註: TXT 誤聽為 賣) 東西跟投資這個公司有什麼（關係）？還是在完全不一樣的世界？                                                           | **Me:** So, do you think buying (Note: TXT misheard as "selling") things and investing in this company have any (relationship)? Or are they in completely different worlds? |
| **Interviewee:** 買東西跟投資這個東西，我覺得是有（關係）。我覺得有可能性質不太一樣，但是我覺得買東西也是在增加嗎？增加這個...這個公司的那些資金啊那些的東西。就是妳其實是在...妳做這件事情對於公司是有好的效益。 | **Interviewee:** Buying things and investing in this thing, I think there is (a relationship). I think the nature might be slightly different, but I feel buying things is also increasing, right? Increasing this... this company's funds and those things. It means you actually are... doing this action has a good benefit for the company. |
| **Me:** 那如果妳非常喜歡一個公司的產品，妳會比較考慮買這個公司的股票嗎？                                                                                      | **Me:** So if you really like a company's product, would you be more inclined to consider buying that company's stock?                                              |
| **Interviewee:** 我覺得我會，我覺得我會。                                                                                                                   | **Interviewee:** I think I would, I think I would.                                                                                                                    |
| **Me:** 好。那妳可以幫我回第一個部分嗎？第一個部分。                                                                                                        | **Me:** Okay. Can you help me go back to the first section? The first section.                                                                                      |
| **Me:** 那最下面有兩個按鈕，妳想要按一個嗎？                                                                                                                | **Me:** At the very bottom, there are two buttons. Do you want to press one?                                                                                          |
| **Interviewee:** 好，我按這個好了。                                                                                                                           | **Interviewee:** Okay, I'll press this one.                                                                                                                           |
| **Me:** 妳剛剛按什麼？                                                                                                                                      | **Me:** What did you just press?                                                                                                                                      |
| **Interviewee:** 我按了「尋找替代產品」。                                                                                                                     | **Interviewee:** I pressed "Find Alternative Products".                                                                                                               |
| **Me:** 那為什麼按這個？                                                                                                                                    | **Me:** Why press this one?                                                                                                                                           |
| **Interviewee:** 因為我已經看到這個產品不太好的部分，我確實會想要去看看有沒有其他可以替代的產品。                                                              | **Interviewee:** Because I've already seen the not-so-good parts of this product, I would indeed want to see if there are other products that can substitute it.      |
| **Me:** 好 (註: TXT 誤聽為 蛤)。那，呃，它有跟妳說什麼？                                                                                                        | **Me:** Okay (Note: TXT misheard as "Huh"). Then, uh, what did it tell you?                                                                                            |
| **Interviewee:** 他說，喔，就他講出Dior它這個品牌對於環境汙染的問題，然後除此之外有三家公司嗎？有三家公司，它其實是對環境比較友善的，這樣子。然後他就在分析說這幾家公司的ESG評分，還有一些跟環境有關的項目。 | **Interviewee:** It said, oh, it pointed out the environmental pollution issues of this Dior brand, and besides that, are there three companies? There are three companies that are actually more environmentally friendly, like that. Then it analyzed the ESG ratings of these companies, and some environment-related items. |
| **Me:** 那妳覺得它跟妳說的是有用的嗎？                                                                                                                      | **Me:** Do you think what it told you is useful?                                                                                                                    |
| **Interviewee:** 這個是...當然是有用的，我覺得這是有用的，確實這是真的。                                                                                    | **Interviewee:** This is... of course it's useful, I think this is useful, indeed this is true.                                                                      |
| **Me:** 對，我剛剛有想到這個問題。                                                                                                                          | **Me:** Yes, I just thought of this question.                                                                                                                         |
| **Interviewee:** 會，我會。而且其實它雖然告訴我這些資訊是有用的，但是它這些東西，因為我看不見它的數據，所以我覺得這是有點類似主觀的想法嗎？這樣子。例如說，他直接跟我說喔這是低 (註: TXT 誤聽為 d)、這是高、這是中，然後有待改善、哪裡不好什麼之類的，但他沒有給我看到那個數據。 | **Interviewee:** Yes, I would. And actually, although the information it tells me is useful, but these things, because I can't see its data, so I feel it's a bit like a subjective thought? Like that. For example, it directly tells me oh this is low (Note: TXT misheard as d), this is high, this is medium, then needs improvement, where it's not good, things like that, but it didn't show me the data. |
| **Me:** 好。那妳有什麼問題想問它嗎？也可以自己打字，還是可以按按鈕都可以。問它什麼都可以問。妳要去上面...上面。                                                 | **Me:** Okay. Do you have any questions you want to ask it? You can also type yourself, or you can press the buttons. You can ask it anything. You need to go up... up. |
| **Me:** 妳剛剛問什麼？                                                                                                                                      | **Me:** What did you just ask?                                                                                                                                        |
| **Interviewee:** 我剛剛問它「我怎麼可以更環保？」                                                                                                             | **Interviewee:** I just asked it, "How can I be more environmentally friendly?"                                                                                       |
| **Me:** 那這個內容裡面有什麼妳之前 (註: TXT 用 最近) 不知道的嗎？                                                                                           | **Me:** Is there anything in this content that you didn't know before (Note: TXT used "recently")?                                                                     |
| **Interviewee:** 我之前 (註: TXT 用 最近) 不知道...「考慮購買就」...沒有，其實這些東西我都知道。                                                               | **Interviewee:** Before (Note: TXT used "recently") I didn't know... "Consider buying then"... No, actually, I know all these things.                                |
| **Me:** OK。那妳可以介紹一下它跟妳說什麼嗎？好。妳自己覺得重點在哪裡？妳覺得哪裡重要？                                                                       | **Me:** OK. Can you explain what it told you? Okay. What do you think the main point is? Where do you think is important?                                        |
| **Interviewee:** 呃，我覺得重要的有那個吧，「減少購物頻率」，還有「修理而非丟棄」，還有「支持本地產品」，這三個。                                                   | **Interviewee:** Uh, I think the important ones are that, "Reduce shopping frequency," also "Repair instead of discarding," and "Support local products," these three. |
| **Me:** 好的。那妳有其他的問題想問嗎？嗯，也可以再次打字 (註: TXT 誤聽為 答次) 問。                                                                        | **Me:** Okay. Do you have other questions you want to ask? Hmm, you can also type (Note: TXT misheard as "answer times") again to ask.                        |
| **Me:** 這個妳問什麼？                                                                                                                                      | **Me:** What did you ask about this?                                                                                                                                  |
| **Interviewee:** 「欸，我買的產品裡有沒有對我身體有害的化學物質？」                                                                                           | **Interviewee:** "Hey, are there any chemical substances harmful to my body in the products I buy?"                                                                 |
| **Interviewee:** 喔，然後它跟我說可以告訴它具體的產品或品牌，所以我（下次）是要打字嗎？                                                                       | **Interviewee:** Oh, then it told me I can tell it the specific product or brand, so do I need to type (next time)?                                                  |
| **Me:** 對。好。（看到 interviewee 在打字）妳要寫什麼？ 沒關係。                                                                                             | **Me:** Yes. Okay. (Sees interviewee typing) What are you writing? It's okay.                                                                                       |
| **Me:** 那如果不需要打字，可以跟它用聲音對話比較好嗎？                                                                                                      | **Me:** So if typing isn't needed, would it be better to have a voice conversation with it?                                                                           |
| **Interviewee:** 可以用聲音？好...我覺得目前沒有這個設定。 ... 會比較方便一點。                                                                               | **Interviewee:** Use voice? Okay... I think currently there isn't this setting. ... It would be a bit more convenient.                                          |
| **Me:** 好。妳也可以用英文跟它講喔。好，如果比較方便。                                                                                                      | **Me:** Okay. You can also speak to it in English. Okay, if it's more convenient.                                                                                  |
| **Interviewee:** （嘗試打英文）好像不太好...喔。嗯...（Me: 妳在找什麼？）我在找那個...那個品牌的英文是什麼...沒關係，那我換一個好了。                         | **Interviewee:** (Tries typing in English) Seems not quite right... Oh. Hmm... (Me: What are you looking for?) I'm looking for the... the English name of that brand... Never mind, I'll switch to another one. |
| **Me:** 那這個（回答）的裡面有什麼妳不知道的嗎？                                                                                                            | **Me:** Is there anything in this (answer) that you didn't know?                                                                                                     |
| **Interviewee:** 像其實我不知道口紅裡面會有鉛，然後我也沒有知道鄰苯二甲酸酯這種比較學名一點的化學物質。                                                         | **Interviewee:** Like, actually I didn't know there could be lead in lipstick, and I also didn't know about phthalates, this kind of more scientific chemical substance. |
| **Me:** 好。那妳剛剛提到這個，妳有什麼感覺嗎？會影響妳的想法還是什麼？                                                                                        | **Me:** Okay. You mentioned this just now, do you have any feelings about it? Does it influence your thoughts or anything?                                        |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯，我會意識到好像不要那麼常化妝。對。                                                                                                      | **Interviewee:** Hmm, I'll realize maybe I shouldn't wear makeup so often. Yes.                                                                                     |
| **Me:** 好的。OK。那妳可以幫我回那個Momo那邊。                                                                                                                | **Me:** Okay. OK. Can you help me go back to the Momo page?                                                                                                         |
| **Me:** 呃，最 (註: TXT 誤聽為 桌子) 上面有一個代碼，綠色的那個，妳可以幫我講出來嗎？                                                                       | **Me:** Uh, at the very (Note: TXT misheard as "table") top, there's a code, the green one, can you say it out loud for me?                                       |
| **Interviewee:** 這個代碼是17LSR。(註: Participant read E7L)                                                                                                  | **Interviewee:** This code is 17LSR.

Okay, okay.                                                                                                 |

| **Interviewer:** 好的。那我介紹一下，我是成功大學創意設計所的學生，然後這個是我的論文的一部分，一個環保的 App。那等一下你可以幫我測試這個軟體嗎？                                                                                                                                          | **Interviewer:** Okay.

| **Interviewee:** 品牌嗎？感覺很不錯，因為是可以上市，應該就是不錯。然後它有國際電壓，嗯，就是可以...感覺就是可以帶出國，然後不用再特別用轉接頭，所以是對女孩子來說很方便。                                                                                                                              | **Interviewee:** The brand? Feels pretty good, because it can be listed [publicly traded], it should be good. And it has international voltage, um, which means you can... feels like you can take it abroad, and don't need a special adapter, so it's very convenient for girls. |

Um. Okay. So here, on this webpage, where is the most important part?                                                                                                                                 |

| **Interviewee:** 哦，就是別的品牌可能更環保一點，所以我可以購買這些品牌作為替代。                                                                           | **Interviewee:** Oh, it means other brands might be a bit more environmentally friendly, so I can buy these brands as alternatives.                                         |
| **Me:** 好。那妳有什麼問題妳想要自己問它嗎？                                                                                                                | **Me:** Okay.

Can I press this?                                                                                          |

| **Me:** 然後它推薦我可以制定購物清單、設定預算或是「三思後行」。這些有什麼妳之前沒有自己想到的嗎？什麼新的嗎？                                                  | **Me:** Then it recommended I can create a shopping list, set a budget, or "Think thrice before acting." Is there anything here you hadn't thought of yourself before? Anything new? |
| **Interviewee:** 我覺得，嗯...「選擇可持續產品」可能是我之前沒有想過的。                                                                                    | **Interviewee:** I think, hmm...

| **Interviewee:** 嗯...我覺得重點...我覺得重點可能是...還是最重要的，是要多去有主動的一些行動，像是說你可以去直接跟公司反映啊，或者是政策上面的支持，這樣子。          | **Interviewee:** Hmm... I think the point... I think the point might be... still the most important thing is to take more proactive actions, like, say, you can directly give feedback to the company, or support relevant policies, like that. |

| **Interviewee:** 有。                                                                                                                       | **Interviewee:** Yes.                                                                                                                               |
| **Me:** 那你當場 (註: 應為 通常) 會買什麼？                                                                                                  | **Me:** What do you usually (Note: "on the spot" likely misspoken/misheard, context suggests "usually") buy?                                        |
| **Interviewee:** Momo的話，通常會買一些3C用品或家電比較多。                                                                                 | **Interviewee:** On Momo, I usually buy more 3C products or home appliances.                                                                        |
| **Me:** 那其他的品牌呢？ (註: TXT 用 平颱)                                                                                                  | **Me:** What about other brands? (Note: TXT used "platforms")                                                                                       |
| **Interviewee:** 其他就是不一樣的，就是衣服或者之類的。                                                                                     | **Interviewee:** Others are different, like clothes or things like that.                                                                            |
| **Me:** 買這樣沒關。(註: 應為 日用品？) 是不是衣服或者日用品？好。那Momo上沒有衣服嗎？                                                       | **Me:** Buying like this doesn't matter. (Note: Likely meant "Daily necessities?") Are they clothes or daily necessities? Okay. Doesn't Momo have clothes? |
| **Interviewee:** 就是通常大家會覺得Momo上面的家電比較便宜，而且Momo的宅配選項就是比較多的感覺。                                              | **Interviewee:** It's just that people usually think home appliances on Momo are cheaper, and Momo's home delivery options feel more numerous.           |
| **Me:** 好，跟其他的比。那目前你有什麼想要買嗎？ (註: JSON/TXT 誤聽為 賣)                                                                     | **Me:** Okay, compared to others. Is there anything you want to buy right now? (Note: JSON/TXT misheard as "sell")                                     |
| **Interviewee:** 最近的話，嗯，應該是耳機吧。                                                                                               | **Interviewee:** Recently, um, probably headphones.                                                                                                 |
| **Me:** 好。那你，呃，可以幫我找一下你想要買的嗎？喔，我...注意一下...欸，找不到。你會打品牌嗎？因為我不知道他的那個在哪裡。                | **Me:** Okay. Uh, can you help me find what you want to buy? Oh, I... pay attention... Hey, can't find it. Would you type the brand? Because I don't know where it is. |
| **Interviewee:** (Searches)                                                                                                               | **Interviewee:** (Searches)                                                                                                                       |
| **Me:** 你要查什麼？                                                                                                                        | **Me:** What are you searching for?                                                                                                                 |
| **Interviewee:** 就是耳機。                                                                                                                 | **Interviewee:** Just headphones.                                                                                                                   |
| **Me:** 耳機，yeah。Mhm。那你想找什麼品牌嗎？                                                                                               | **Me:** Headphones, yeah. Mhm. Are you looking for a specific brand?                                                                                |
| **Interviewee:** 還是...我最近是看這個，Sony的。                                                                                            | **Interviewee:** Or... recently I've been looking at this one, Sony.                                                                                |
| **Me:** Sony的？那為什麼Sony？Sony的耳機？就是耳罩式的耳機？                                                                                  | **Me:** Sony? Why Sony? Sony headphones? The over-ear type?                                                                                         |
| **Interviewee:** 對。                                                                                                                       | **Interviewee:** Right.                                                                                                                             |
| **Me:** 好。那你為什麼要選 (註: JSON 誤聽為 幹嘛) 這個呢？這個品牌？                                                                        | **Me:** Okay. Why did you choose (Note: JSON misheard as "what for") this one? This brand?                                                          |
| **Interviewee:** 因為就是耳機的話其實很多選擇，可是我之前試過朋友的Sony的耳罩式，我覺得還蠻不錯的。就是它的那個戴起來... (註: JSON 誤聽為 代償人) 因為很多的耳機 (註: JSON 誤聽為 雞) 戴久了都會痛啊，但是這些...還沒有買 (註: JSON 誤聽為 賣) 過這個品牌。 | **Interviewee:** Because for headphones, there are actually many choices, but I tried a friend's Sony over-ear ones before, and I thought they were quite good. Just the way they feel when worn... (Note: JSON misheard "wearing comfort" as "compensation person") Because many headphones (Note: JSON misheard "headphones" as "chicken") hurt after wearing them for a long time, but these... I haven't bought (Note: JSON misheard as "sell") this brand before. |
| **Me:** 對。好。那，呃，你這個...這個網頁上，重要的地方在哪裡？                                                                              | **Me:** Right. Okay. Uh, on this... this webpage, where are the important parts?                                                                    |
| **Interviewee:** 最重要的地方？                                                                                                             | **Interviewee:** The most important parts?                                                                                                          |
| **Me:** 對。                                                                                                                                | **Me:** Yes.                                                                                                                                        |
| **Interviewee:** 就是如果是論一個商品的話，最重要的就是圖片跟價格嘛，然後還有品名這樣子，基本上就已經很夠了。                                | **Interviewee:** If we're talking about a product, the most important things are the picture and the price, right? And also the product name like that, basically that's enough. |
| **Me:** 好。那你覺得這裡還有什麼其他的新的嗎？你之前沒有看過嗎？這一塊？                                                                    | **Me:** Okay. Do you think there's anything else new here? Haven't you seen this part before? This section?                                         |
| **Interviewee:** 這塊...                                                                                                                    | **Interviewee:** This section...                                                                                                                    |
| **Me:** 好。那你覺得這一塊是什麼？                                                                                                          | **Me:** Okay. What do you think this section is?                                                                                                    |
| **Interviewee:** 這一塊，它是類似給你建議的嗎？或是...就是會給你一些資訊讓你參考。好。                                                    | **Interviewee:** This section, is it something like giving you suggestions? Or... it just gives you some information for reference. Okay.                 |
| **Me:** 然後就是它下面還有這種環保指數...                                                                                                   | **Me:** And then below it, there's this environmental index...                                                                                      |
| **Interviewee:** 應該會比較偏，就是會幫你看這個東西的個人環保，有沒有幫助。                                                                | **Interviewee:** It probably leans more towards, like, helping you see the personal environmental impact of this item, whether it's helpful.           |
| **Me:** 好。那買東西的時候呢，你會考慮它的環保嗎？                                                                                          | **Me:** Okay. When buying things, do you consider their environmental impact?                                                                       |
| **Interviewee:** 其實不太會。                                                                                                               | **Interviewee:** Actually, not really.                                                                                                              |
| **Me:** 好。那這個內容的重點在哪裡？                                                                                                        | **Me:** Okay. What is the main point of this content?                                                                                               |
| **Interviewee:** 就是它會給你參考它這個品牌的，然後這個東西的資訊，讓你了解。好。                                                            | **Interviewee:** It gives you information about this brand for reference, and information about this item, letting you understand. Okay.                |
| **Me:** 那我看完這個了，你可以找一些可能更好的替代品，不一定要馬上買，可以比較。好。那你幫我看到那個第二個部分，「儲蓄」，你覺得這個是什麼？ | **Me:** Now that I've read this, you can find some potentially better alternatives, you don't have to buy immediately, you can compare. Okay. Can you help me look at the second part, "Savings"? What do you think this is? |
| **Interviewee:** 儲蓄？嗯...儲蓄喔？他可能...看一下喔，就是他會，就是可能有一些品牌的小品...小品牌，碳排放會比較少嘛，如果是...就是比起大公司的。 | **Interviewee:** Savings? Um... Savings, huh? He might... let me see, it means he will, like, maybe some brands' small items... small brands, their carbon emissions might be lower, right? If it's... compared to big companies. |
| **Me:** 那再...現在其他的品牌你有買過還是看過嗎？                                                                                          | **Me:** Then again... have you bought or seen these other brands before?                                                                             |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯...沒有。                                                                                                                | **Interviewee:** Um... no.                                                                                                                          |
| **Me:** 好。那你覺得為什麼他會推薦這些品牌呢？                                                                                              | **Me:** Okay. Why do you think it recommends these brands?                                                                                          |
| **Interviewee:** 因為他的...他的解釋就是說這些要嘛就是，一開始的原料就比較環保，有些是可以用比較久，然後用比較久的話，它平均下來每天的...就是每天除下來的排放量 (註: TXT 誤聽為 配方量) 比較少。 | **Interviewee:** Because its... its explanation is that these are either, the raw materials are more environmentally friendly from the start, or some can be used longer, and if used longer, its average daily... the daily divided emissions (Note: TXT misheard as "formula amount") are lower. |
| **Me:** 好。那看到這些其他的品牌，你會考慮其他的嗎？                                                                                        | **Me:** Okay. Seeing these other brands, would you consider others?                                                                                 |
| **Interviewee:** 會。因為其實我對原料這種東西比較還好，可是如果我，如果知道這個東西，就是我有另外一個品牌比較耐用，可以用比較久，我可能就會想要參考一下。 | **Interviewee:** Yes. Because actually, I'm relatively indifferent to raw materials, but if I know this item, like, if I have another brand that's more durable and can be used longer, I might want to check it out for reference. |
| **Me:** 好。那因為這裡的氣壓不多啊 (註: JSON 誤聽，應為 資料不多啊)，你還是想要看什麼其他的嗎？你說什麼意思？就是這些品牌，其他的品牌，這裡有他的名詞而已，沒有很多。有什麼你比較想知道嗎？ | **Me:** Okay. Since the air pressure here isn't much (Note: JSON misheard, should be "data isn't much"), do you still want to see anything else? What do you mean? Like these brands, other brands, there are only their names here, not much else. Is there anything you particularly want to know? |
| **Interviewee:** 應該是這一個，就是耐用設計。                                                                                                | **Interviewee:** Probably this one, the durable design.                                                                                             |
| **Me:** 好，為什麼這個呢？                                                                                                                  | **Me:** Okay, why this one?                                                                                                                         |
| **Interviewee:** 因為如果我自己買東西的話，我會比較注重，我希望它可以永久很久 (註: 應為 用很久)...因為我買東西會憂鬱很久 (註: 應為 猶豫很久)，所以我會想說只要我這個東西我可以使用的很久的話就可以明確的麻煩 (註: 應為 買)。 OK。 | **Interviewee:** Because if I buy things myself, I pay more attention, I hope it can last forever for a long time (Note: Should be "be used for a long time")... Because I get depressed for a long time when buying things (Note: Should be "hesitate for a long time"), so I'd think as long as I can use this thing for a long time, then I can clearly trouble (Note: Should be "buy"). OK. |
| **Me:** 那你想要看的什麼圖片嗎？還是什麼其他的評論？還是...？                                                                                 | **Me:** Do you want to see any pictures? Or any other reviews? Or...?                                                                               |
| **Interviewee:** 目前沒...目前沒有。                                                                                                        | **Interviewee:** Not currently... currently no.                                                                                                     |
| **Me:** 好。那如果，如果我可以...因為現在什麼都沒有，那如果有什麼其他的氣調 (註: JSON 誤聽，應為 資料)，你讓...你要看什麼 (註: JSON 誤聽 場嗎)？它的評論還是照片還是價格還是...？ | **Me:** Okay. What if, what if I could... Because there's nothing now, but if there was some other air conditioning (Note: JSON misheard, should be "data"), you let... what do you want to see (Note: JSON misheard "place")? Its reviews or photos or price or...? |
| **Interviewee:** 如果是這邊要再加一點東西的話，我希望我可以看到價格跟，就是可能跟這個牌子的比較。因為就是我看到這些，可是我可能不太確定那我原本的是多少，或是我不是這邊推薦的，他可能不一定是一定一樣的東西啊。 | **Interviewee:** If something were to be added here, I hope I could see the price and, like, maybe a comparison with this brand. Because I see these, but I might not be sure how much my original one was, or maybe it's not the one recommended here, it might not necessarily be the exact same thing. |
| **Me:** 嗯。對。然後我也想要看說，就是比價這樣子。嗯。還是另外一個想法是，你也可以...那個通常人會使用這個產品多久？ 對。                           | **Me:** Mhm. Right. And I also want to see, like, price comparison. Mhm. Or another idea is, you could also... how long do people typically use this product? Right. |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯。這個我覺得平常大家會使用多久感覺就比較難，就是比較難就是短時間研究出來吧，因為他假設這個產品剛出，他們也要一段時間才會知道說這個東西可以用多久。 | **Interviewee:** Um. This one, I think how long everyone usually uses it feels harder, it's harder to research in a short time, right? Because assuming this product just came out, they also need some time to know how long this thing can be used. |
| **Me:** 好。來可以嗎？你幫我看到你的第三個部分，你覺得這個是什麼？                                                                          | **Me:** Okay. Come on, can you? Help me look at your third part, what do you think this is?                                                          |
| **Interviewee:** 哦，是原本公司的股票嗎？嗯。哦，所以我到時候開的話還可以看到它這個公司的最近的市場發展？                                      | **Interviewee:** Oh, is it the original company's stock? Um. Oh, so if I open it then, I can still see this company's recent market development?           |
| **Me:** 對。那你，你趁現有要投資過嗎？ (註: JSON 誤聽 你趁現有要透直播嗎)                                                                     | **Me:** Right. Have you, have you taken the opportunity to invest before? (Note: JSON misheard "Have you taken the opportunity to live stream now?")   |
| **Interviewee:** 有，那種就是模擬投資啊。實際上的沒有。                                                                                      | **Interviewee:** Yes, the kind that's simulated investing. Not actual investing.                                                                    |
| **Me:** 好。那你現在買 (註: JSON/TXT 誤聽為 賣) 東西跟投資 (註: JSON 誤聽為 透抽) 有什麼關係嗎？還是從完全不一樣的？                       | **Me:** Okay. Does buying (Note: JSON/TXT misheard as "selling") things now have any relation to investing (Note: JSON misheard as "cuttlefish")? Or are they completely different? |
| **Interviewee:** 就是，雖然說實際在投資的時候，你不會覺得說一般人買東西對這個，這個的波動有沒有那麼的明顯，就是我買不買其實對現在的股票其實不會差太多。但是假設每個人都，就是他可能這間，這間公司可能最近有什麼比較，比如說新品上市，或是出現什麼，就是比如說，呃，影響品牌的信譽的東西，那可能他的股票就會跌。我覺得那種比較重要。就是一般的消費的話可能比較還好。 | **Interviewee:** Well, although when actually investing, you wouldn't feel that ordinary people buying things has such an obvious effect on the fluctuations of this, this stock. Like, whether I buy or not doesn't really make much difference to the current stock price. But suppose everyone, like, maybe this, this company recently had something major, like a new product launch, or something happened, like, uh, something affecting the brand's reputation, then maybe its stock price will fall. I think that kind of thing is more important. Regular consumption might be less significant. |
| **Me:** 可是品牌的信譽會影響人要不要消費。嗯。那如果你很喜歡這個，這個品牌，你會比較考慮買這個，這個股票嗎？                                   | **Me:** But brand reputation affects whether people want to consume. Um. So if you really like this, this brand, would you be more likely to consider buying this, this stock? |
| **Interviewee:** 其實如果，如果我喜歡這個品牌是因為它的產品的話，可能會。因為就是假設這個產品真的好用的話，就會讓可能這個東西就會比較暢銷。可是我可能主要還是會比較care說這個品牌的發展性如何，因為像Sony已經上市很久了。然後我可能就是，就算我很喜歡，也是要看時間才可以去買，不一定說我很希望 (註: JSON 誤聽) 我就可以買。 | **Interviewee:** Actually, if, if I like this brand because of its products, maybe. Because if this product is really good, it might make this thing sell better. But I might still mainly care more about the brand's development potential, because like Sony has been listed for a long time. And I might just, even if I like it a lot, I still need to consider the timing to buy, it's not necessarily that just because I really want (Note: JSON misheard "like" as "hope") it, I can buy it. |
| **Me:** 嗯。對啦。那它，它這裡跟你講的那個啊 (註: 應為 內容)，重點在哪裡？                                                                     | **Me:** Um. Right. So, what it, what it tells you here (Note: "ah" likely filler, meant "content"), where is the main point?                             |
| **Interviewee:** 他會先跟你說就是最近他的近期的股票趨勢，那我就可以看出來它最近就是雖然前陣子有點跌 (註: JSON 誤聽)，但是最近有在慢慢的上升。然後呢再來就是他會說他的，就是這些這個品牌對對環保的領域做了什麼事情，然後什麼事情沒有做，這樣子。 | **Interviewee:** It first tells you its recent stock trend. Then I can see that recently, although it dipped (Note: JSON misheard "dipped" as "a bit") a while ago, it has been slowly rising recently. And then next, it will talk about its, like what this brand has done in the field of environmental protection, and what it hasn't done, like that. |
| **Me:** 好。那，呃，可以幫我回那個第一個部分那個嗎？                                                                                          | **Me:** Okay. Uh, can you help me go back to that first part?                                                                                       |
| **Interviewee:** 對。                                                                                                                       | **Interviewee:** Right.                                                                                                                             |
| **Me:** 那最下面有兩個按鈕，你想要按哪個嗎？                                                                                                | **Me:** At the very bottom, there are two buttons. Which one do you want to press?                                                                  |
| **Interviewee:** 呃，這個。因為產地我應該會知道。                                                                                            | **Interviewee:** Uh, this one. Because I probably know the place of origin.                                                                         |
| **Me:** 好。那為什麼你要這個呢？                                                                                                            | **Me:** Okay. Why do you want this one?                                                                                                             |
| **Interviewee:** 因為就是買東西的話，你一定要比較說會不會有比這個更好的商品。因為產地的話其實你自己如果這是一個大牌子或什麼的，你其實可以猜到說他產地是哪一天 (註: 應為 哪裡)。嗯。對。所以我可能會比較想要知道說其他品牌在這方面做得怎麼樣。 | **Interviewee:** Because when buying things, you definitely need to compare if there are better products than this one. Because for the place of origin, if it's a big brand or something, you can actually guess where its place of origin is (Note: "which day" misspoken/misheard, meant "where"). Um. Right. So I might be more interested in knowing how other brands are doing in this aspect. |
| **Me:** 好。那這個，剛剛打...它給你講的內容裡面有什麼重要的嗎？                                                                                | **Me:** Okay. This one, just typed... is there anything important in the content it gave you?                                                        |
| **Interviewee:** 我看一下喔。就是他會，他因為他這裡的那個，他這裡舉例的就跟...就會牌子就會比較大，然後我就可以看說這三個，這三個關於環保的，關於環保或是人權管理的部分做了什麼事情。然後這些品牌會比較像是，一般人會參考的。因為剛剛那些就是說碳排放量很低的，可能平常我們要買的時候我們不會想到，但是我們想到這些，然後我們可以之間 (註: 應為 直接) 比較的話其實還不錯。而且他最後也會幫我們統整說誰跟誰在評分上面比較好，然後就是會變成更好的選擇。 | **Interviewee:** Let me see. It will, because here, the examples it gives are like... the brands will be bigger, and then I can see these three, what these three have done regarding environmental protection, or human rights management. And these brands are more like what ordinary people would refer to. Because those ones just now that said low carbon emissions, maybe we wouldn't think of them when we usually buy, but we think of these, and if we can compare between (Note: "between" likely misspoken, meant "directly") them, it's actually quite good. And finally, it also helps us summarize who compares better with whom in terms of rating, and then it becomes a better choice. |
| **Me:** 那你有什麼其他的問題你想要問他嗎？也可以做其他測試。                                                                                | **Me:** Do you have any other questions you want to ask it? You can also do other tests.                                                            |
| **Interviewee:** 那個這題大車 (註: JSON 誤聽，應為 替代產品)                                                                                 | **Interviewee:** That question, big car (Note: JSON misheard, likely meant "alternative products" based on button function)                           |
| **Me:** 好。你可以幫我講出來嗎？要去上面。                                                                                                  | **Me:** Okay. Can you say it out loud for me? Need to go up.                                                                                        |
| **Interviewee:** 就是檢查一個產品的可課 (註: 應為 可持續性)...就是不管是買自己買東西或是買家用品，就是一個東西，可持續性。就是，我覺得就是之前會有人說你的消費決定你的生活，就是你要像是比如說像我可能不喜歡就是之前會有一些那種剝削的，使用剝削的棉花的品牌，我可能就不會消費。就是我覺得說聯合抵制或是什麼，這件事情是對公司會有壓力的。那假設我在環保這部分上，然後大家也許注意到這件事情去相對的比較少買，對品牌，對品牌也是硬傷 (註: 應為 影響)。然後品牌就會想，就是知道這件事情，然後來改善這個狀況。 | **Interviewee:** Just checking a product's class class (Note: Should be "sustainability")... It's like whether buying things for myself or buying household goods, just one thing, sustainability. It's like, I feel like someone said before, "Your consumption determines your world." It's like you need to, for example, like maybe I don't like brands that previously used exploitative, exploited cotton, I might not consume them. It's just, I feel that boycotting together or something, this matter puts pressure on the company. So suppose in the environmental aspect, and maybe everyone notices this matter and relatively buys less, for the brand, for the brand it's also a hard injury (Note: Should be "impact"). Then the brand will think, know about this matter, and then improve this situation. |
| **Me:** 好。好。可以幫我回那個Momo那邊。那最上面有一個代碼，你可以幫我講出來？                                                              | **Me:** Okay. Okay. Can you help me go back to the Momo page? At the very top, there's a code, can you say it out loud for me?                     |
| **Interviewee:** 代碼？哪一個？                                                                                                               | **Interviewee:** Code? Which one?                                                                                                                   |
| **Me:** 這個綠色的代碼。                                                                                                                    | **Me:** This green code.                                                                                                                            |
| **Interviewee:** C5LGY。                                                                                                                    | **Interviewee:** C5LGY.                                                                                                                             |

| **Interviewee:** 呃...我覺得可能制定購物清單，就是...我有時候會看一看，然後就很想要，但是其實也不是那麼想要，就是腦波太弱了，看到廣告很吸引人就想要買。那制定購物清單就可以讓我三思而後行。                                                                                                                      | **Interviewee:** Uh... I think maybe making a shopping list, because... sometimes I look around, and then I really want something, but actually I don't want it that much, just my brain waves are too weak, I see an attractive ad and want to buy. So making a shopping list can make me think twice before acting. |

Investing?                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Interviewee:** (Looks) 推薦投資他嗎？可是他不是不好嗎？所以我應該不會想投資他。                                                                                                                                                         | **Interviewee:** (Looks) Recommend investing in it? But isn't it bad? So I probably wouldn't want to invest in it.                                                                                                                               |
| **Interviewer:** 所以你覺得賣東西跟投資有什麼關係嗎？還是是完全不一樣的？                                                                                                                                                               | **Interviewer:** So do you think selling things and investing have any relationship? Or are they completely different?                                                                                                                           |
| **Interviewee:** 會有關係。就是...應該說投資會...就是等於是給那間公司更多的支持，不是嗎？對我來說解釋是這樣子。                                                                                                                                | **Interviewee:** There would be a relationship. Just... should say investing would... just means giving that company more support, doesn't it? To me, the explanation is like that.                                                                |
| **Interviewer:** 所以如果今天那個公司，它是不優的，那它當然就不要去投資它了。                                                                                                                                                              | **Interviewer:** So if today that company, it's not good, then of course one shouldn't invest in it.                                                                                                                                           |
| **Interviewee:** 所以如果它的商品很好，你比較會想要投資嗎？                                                                                                                                                                            | **Interviewee:** So if its products are very good, you'd be more inclined to invest?                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Interviewer:** 對對對。哦...就是支持他們。對，支持他們。對對對。                                                                                                                                                                       | **Interviewer:** Yes yes yes. Oh... just supporting them. Yes, supporting them. Yes yes yes.                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Interviewee:** 好的。                                                                                                                                                                                                        | **Interviewee:** Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Interviewer:** 好。那那個卡片上可以幫我寫這個綠色的號碼？後面...                                                                                                                                                                  | **Interviewer:** Okay.

Later...                                                                                                                                                     |

| **Interviewer:** 首先我要問你，我可以錄影我們的對話嗎？                                                                                                                                                                            | **Interviewer:** First, I want to ask you, can I record our conversation?                                                                                                                                                                      |

| **Interviewer:** 好。那可以大聲一點講，哈？因為這裡有很多人。                                                                                                                                                                        | **Interviewer:** Okay.

| **Interviewee:** 我要對著他嗎？                                                                                                                                                                                                | **Interviewee:** Do I need to face it?                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Interviewer:** 這樣可以吧。好。那第一個問題是，你平常會...你平常會網路上買東西嗎？                                                                                                                                                          | **Interviewer:** This should be fine. Okay.

| **Interviewee:** 他寫代號，應該是就是這間公司的代號，然後底下應該就是他列出來的股票的圖表。                                                                                                                                                          | **Interviewee:** It writes code, it should be the code for this company, and below should be the stock charts it listed.                                                                                                                        |

(Looks at chart)... I probably wouldn't buy, because its volatility is a bit too high.                                                                                                         |
