Hmm okay.                                                                                                                    |
| **Me:** (Background noise - 打那個關掉)                                                                                                                     | **Me:** (Background noise - hit that turn off)                                                                                                                                        |
| **Me:** 妳最近有用過Momo (註: JSON 誤聽為 媽媽) 嗎？                                                                                                          | **Me:** Have you used Momo (Note: JSON misheard as "mom") recently?                                                                                                                     |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯，我沒有用過Momo，我有用過蝦皮。                                                                                                           | **Interviewee:** Hmm, I haven't used Momo, I have used Shopee.                                                                                                                          |
| **Me:** OK。那妳平常網路上會買 (註: JSON 誤聽為 賣) 什麼樣的東西？                                                                                          | **Me:** OK. What kind of things do you usually buy (Note: JSON misheard as "sell") online?                                                                                             |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯...我想一下...網路上會買什麼東西...我都買一些蠻奇怪的東西。比如說，因為我喜歡做，嗯，就是吊飾之類的那種手作，所以我會去買那種材料，或是毛線之類的，我也會編織之類的，就是都會上網去買這些東西。 | **Interviewee:** Hmm... let me think... what do I buy online... I buy some rather strange things. For example, because I like to make, hmm, like charms and that kind of handmade craft, so I buy those kinds of materials, or yarn, things like that, I also knit, things like that, I buy all these things online. |
| **Me:** 好。那妳覺得Momo上，有什麼妳想要買的嗎？                                                                                                              | **Me:** Okay. Do you think there's anything you want to buy on Momo?                                                                                                                    |
| **Interviewee:** 我要買，我要買保健食品。我覺得最近的...我覺得我最近的記憶力有點下降，所以我要買維他命來吃。                                                     | **Interviewee:** I want to buy, I want to buy health supplements. I feel like recently... I feel like my memory has been declining recently, so I want to buy vitamins to take.       |
| **Me:** 嗯。(Waiting for page to load) 沒有維他命啊？                                                                                                       | **Me:** Hmm. (Waiting for page to load) No vitamins, huh?                                                                                                                             |
| **Me:** 所以妳想要買這個維他命？嗯。好像這個網頁有沒有圖片嗎？沒有他的圖片啊？（看到圖片）有...他還是在搜尋 (註: TXT 誤聽為 設卡) 嗎？他還沒有弄好嗎？妳可以試試refresh一次。啊，妳覺得是網路的問題嗎？有時候學校網路會這樣子，怪怪的喔。就是，還是妳要連我的？ | **Me:** So you want to buy this vitamin? Hmm. Does this webpage seem to have no pictures? No pictures of it? (Sees picture) There is... Is it still searching (Note: TXT misheard as "setting card")? Is it not ready yet? You can try refreshing once. Ah, do you think it's a network problem? Sometimes the school network is like this, a bit strange. So, or do you want to connect to mine? |
| **Interviewee:** 喔好。                                                                                                                                       | **Interviewee:** Oh okay.                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Me:** 把密碼交出來。                                                                                                                                      | **Me:** Hand over the password.                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Interviewee:** (Connects to hotspot) 真的，是網路的問題。有，圖片是很多的。                                                                               | **Interviewee:** (Connects to hotspot) Really, it's a network problem. Yes, there are many pictures.                                                                                  |
| **Me:** 好。這個妳有最近買過嗎？                                                                                                                              | **Me:** Okay. Have you bought this recently?                                                                                                                                          |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯...有哦。                                                                                                                                  | **Interviewee:** Hmm... Yes.                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Me:** 好酷喔。                                                                                                                                            | **Me:** So cool.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Interviewee:** 我自己本身是沒有吃啦，但是我們家也有人有吃過。但是我那個家人其實沒有很熟，所以我只有聽過他有買過魚油這個東西，我沒有看過他吃過。                         | **Interviewee:** I haven't taken it myself, but someone in my family has taken it before. But I'm not very familiar with that family member, so I've only heard that they bought fish oil, I haven't seen them take it. |
| **Me:** 嗯。那剛剛有發生什麼？有什麼新的東西嗎？哇，這個直接跳出來，好酷喔。                                                                                 | **Me:** Hmm. So what happened just now? Was there anything new? Wow, this popped up directly, so cool.                                                                                |
| **Me:** 那妳覺得他的最明顯的部分是什麼？                                                                                                                    | **Me:** What do you think is its most obvious part?                                                                                                                                   |
| **Interviewee:** 他現在看到的是，他有把碳足跡列出來，就是說這一間公司有沒有那個...他對於環保的概念有沒有那個...他列了很詳細的。                                    | **Interviewee:** What I see now is that it has listed the carbon footprint, meaning whether this company has that... whether it has the concept of environmental protection... it listed it very detailedly. |
| **Me:** 嗯。妳覺得自己環保的人嗎？                                                                                                                          | **Me:** Hmm. Do you consider yourself an environmentally conscious person?                                                                                                            |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯...妳覺得自己環保的人嗎？還是還好？                                                                                                       | **Interviewee:** Hmm... Do you consider yourself an environmentally conscious person? Or just okay?                                                                                 |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯，環保...關心它們 (註: TXT 誤聽為 方法) 吧？是還好。就是我會注意這個，就是因為小時候就常講說那個，如果一個東西啊，最好要在自己，就是自己的家這樣子買，這樣子碳足跡就不會比較高。然後，聽懂的話是還好啦，但是有時候會注意。 | **Interviewee:** Hmm, environmental protection... care about them (Note: TXT misheard as "method"), right? It's okay. It's just that I pay attention to this, because when I was young, people often said that, if there's an item, it's best to buy it in your own, like your own home area, that way the carbon footprint won't be as high. So, if understood, it's okay, but sometimes I do pay attention. |
| **Me:** 那妳覺得這個資料 (註: TXT 誤聽為 細療) 有什麼有用的部分嗎？                                                                                         | **Me:** What do you think is the useful part of this data (Note: TXT misheard as "fine treatment")?                                                                                  |
| **Interviewee:** 有用的部分...有用的部分...我是覺得可以讓使用者看到就是說，哦，你們這一間公司，你要買的這一間公司，它那個，它在環保上面有沒有，它在環保上面有沒有用心，這樣子。哇，這個真的好多喔。我看下其他的選擇。 | **Interviewee:** Useful part... useful part... I feel it can let users see, like, oh, this company you're considering buying from, its, whether it's putting effort into environmental protection, like that. Wow, there's really a lot here. Let me look at other options. |
| **Interviewee:** (Looking at MUJI bag) 無印？這是什麼樣的產品？                                                                                             | **Interviewee:** (Looking at MUJI bag) MUJI? What kind of product is this?                                                                                                           |
| **Me:** 是購物袋。                                                                                                                                          | **Me:** It's a shopping bag.                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Interviewee:** 就是那個...在學校啊，在學校我就看到蠻多人在戴這個無印的購物袋 (註: TXT 誤聽為 跟我感覺)，然後出現這個，大概就...基本上呢，就是大家都會，就走在路上的時候就會，如果我們遇到十個人的話，大概有一半的人就會帶走。 | **Interviewee:** It's that... at school, at school I see quite a lot of people carrying this MUJI shopping bag (Note: TXT misheard as "and my feeling"), and seeing this, probably just... basically, everyone does, when walking on the street, if we meet ten people, probably half of them will carry one away. |
| **Me:** 那妳剛剛有看到另外一個產品，無印的產品，然後妳把這個產品...另外一個產品可以比較嗎？一個報告？剛剛那個AI的報告啊。                                            | **Me:** You just saw another product, a MUJI product, and then you put this product... can the other product be compared? A report? That AI report from just now.             |
| **Interviewee:** 所以就要可以先開啊。「社會責任不明」，兩家店？兩家都是「社會責任不明」？嗯哼。對呀，我都聽過...（喃喃自語）...了。                               | **Interviewee:** So I should be able to open it first. "Social responsibility unclear," two stores? Both are "Social responsibility unclear"? Uh-huh. Yeah, I've heard of them all... (muttering)... already. |
| **Me:** (Looking at 3M hook) 今天下雨了，真的好重喔。不然我們去走走？喔...嗯...我不知道...好像有？好像有？那個男的好像有？我決定我要連自己就好。我絕對不要連去... | **Me:** (Looking at 3M hook) It rained today, it's really heavy. Otherwise, shall we go for a walk? Oh... hmm... I don't know... seems like there is? Seems like there is? That guy seems to have one? I've decided I'll just connect to my own. I definitely don't want to connect to... |
| **Interviewee:** 他說這是車？要幾個？一個？                                                                                                                   | **Interviewee:** It says this is a car? How many? One?                                                                                                                                |

| **Me:** 好啊。那這樣就可以了。手機，妳可以使用妳的手機掃描這個QR。那下面有一個問卷 (註: TXT 誤聽為 溫泉)。那這個測試代碼要就是這些，所以如果妳測試一個產品就可以了。但是妳因為妳測試三個產品，可以寫三個。 | **Me:** Okay. That's fine then. Phone, you can use your phone to scan this QR. Then below there's a questionnaire (Note: TXT misheard as "hot spring"). And this test code is just these, so if you tested one product, that's fine. But since you tested three products, you can write three. |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯。喔。                                                                                                                                     | **Interviewee:** Hmm.
