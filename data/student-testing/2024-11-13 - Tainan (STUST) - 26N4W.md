And it shows sold out (Note: TXT misheard as "Tencent sells bowls"), some items are sold out, right, and then can't be found like that.       |
| **Me:** 好。那還有什麼嗎？                                                                                                                                  | **Me:** Okay. Anything else?                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Interviewee:** 然後還有...我都（會）不會在意，我都直接看價錢，然後看一下還有什麼東西，然後就直接買了。                                                        | **Interviewee:** And also... I (will) won't care, I just look at the price directly, then see what else there is, and then just buy it directly.                                     |
| **Me:** 好。那右邊呢？右邊這個？                                                                                                                              | **Me:** Okay. What about the right side? This one on the right?                                                                                                                       |
| **Interviewee:** 這是妳，這是，這是什麼？這應該是妳製作的那個吧？因為通常出現不會出現這個。                                                                   | **Interviewee:** This is you, this is, what is this? This should be the thing you made, right? Because usually this doesn't appear.                                               |
| **Me:** 好。那它，它的，它給妳講什麼？它有講中文？                                                                                                          | **Me:** Okay. Then it, its, what does it tell you? Does it speak Chinese?                                                                                                            |
| **Interviewee:** 品牌，就是介紹吧。然後還有她的一些其他的什麼作品啊，然後好像包裝 (註: TXT 誤聽為 包藏) 一些之類的。喔，還有它的那個碳排放方面，還有它的一些投資股票嗎？之類的。 | **Interviewee:** Brand, it's an introduction, right? And also some of her other works, and seems like packaging (Note: TXT misheard as "conceal"), things like that. Oh, and its carbon emission aspect, and some of its investments, stocks? Things like that. |
| **Me:** 那這個資料 (註: JSON 誤聽為 cdi) 裡面有什麼妳覺得比較有趣的，還是有興趣的部分嗎？                                                                     | **Me:** Is there anything in this data (Note: JSON misheard as "cdi") that you find particularly interesting, or any parts you're interested in?                               |
| **Interviewee:** 有興趣的部分？對... ESG評分 (註: TXT 誤聽為 美麗徽章)。有，她說去就直接，直接棄她出版社的。蛤？對。嗯。還有勞工問題 (註: TXT 誤聽為 老公問題)。 | **Interviewee:** Interested parts? Right... ESG rating (Note: TXT misheard as "Beautiful Badge"). Yes, she said to go directly, directly abandon her publisher. Huh? Right. Hmm. And labor issues (Note: TXT misheard as "husband issues"). |
| **Me:** 好。對。大概就是這樣子。好。那下面還有兩個按鈕 (註: TXT 誤聽為 案子)。呃，妳想按什麼嗎？還是互相按也可以？                                               | **Me:** Okay. Right. Roughly like this. Okay. Then below there are two buttons (Note: TXT misheard as "cases"). Uh, do you want to press anything? Or pressing each other is also okay? |
| **Interviewee:** （網路問題）...然後你可以問...（AI建議）這個是什麼？「比較」和「資訊」，還有比較其他出版社的那些資訊吧？碳排放的那些資訊。                               | **Interviewee:** (Network issue)... Then you can ask... (AI suggestions) What is this? "Compare" and "Information", and also compare information from other publishers? That carbon emission information. |
| **Me:** 好。對。那這個，這個裡面有什麼有興趣的嗎？找到小褲子 (註: TXT 誤聽為 小棍子)？                                                                      | **Me:** Okay. Right. Is there anything interesting in this one? Found small pants (Note: TXT misheard as "small sticks")?                                                       |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯...蠻興趣的耶。我好像都沒在注意這東西耶。哇，都沒在注意耶。有一些出版社之類的。                                                              | **Interviewee:** Hmm... quite interesting. I seem to have never paid attention to this stuff. Wow, never paid attention. There are some publishers and things like that.            |
| **Me:** 那這題妳有什麼問題想要問Lulu AI嗎？                                                                                                                 | **Me:** Do you have any questions you want to ask Lulu AI about this?                                                                                                           |
| **Interviewee:** 我想想我要問什麼...我也是...如果 (註: TXT 誤聽為 我很煩要) 是五千元就買那個，買那個，買那個...我怎麼中獎 (註: TXT 誤聽為 中錢) 了？嗯。再寫一些相關問題？我要問什麼？哇靠...我要想問什麼問題耶。除了這些還有其他的嗎？總感覺如果問好多...你有特點嗎？那應該是角川 (註: TXT 誤聽為 漫甲無敵) 特點。好像很多。我看了我只知道東立跟那個，我也只知道東立、東立跟那個什麼木馬的，反正就是那些。好，尖端。對，尖端。 | **Interviewee:** Let me think what I want to ask... Me too... if (Note: TXT misheard as "I'm annoyed want") it's 5000 yuan then buy that, buy that, buy that... how did I win the lottery (Note: TXT misheard as "hit money")? Hmm. Write some related questions again? What should I ask? Wow damn... I need to think what question to ask. Besides these, are there others? Feels like if I ask too many... Do you have special features? Then it should be Kadokawa's (Note: TXT misheard as "Man Jia Wu Di") special features. Seems like a lot. I looked, I only know Tong Li and that one, I also only know Tong Li, Tong Li and that what's-it-called Mu Ma, anyway just those. Okay, Sharp Point. Yes, Sharp Point. |
| **Me:** 好。那它剛剛說什麼？                                                                                                                                | **Me:** Okay. What did it say just now?                                                                                                                                       |
| **Interviewee:** 它說，我剛剛問...我問說還有其他出版社的嗎？我看有沒有跟三采 (註: TXT 誤聽為 商政) 差別。還有喔，有「位（慰）（未）」，「綠色書」，「自然之聲 (註: TXT 誤聽為 資深)」，「環保」、「出版」。這些的？這些出版社，可持續發展...喔！值得妳考慮支持喔！ | **Interviewee:** It said, I just asked... I asked if there are other publishers? See if there's a difference with Sanmin (Note: TXT misheard as "business politics"). There are, oh, there's "Wei" (comfort/future), "Green Book", "Voice of Nature (Note: TXT misheard as "senior")", "Environmental Protection", "Publishing". These? These publishers, sustainable development... Oh! Worth your consideration to support! |
| **Me:** 妳有買過這些的嗎？                                                                                                                                  | **Me:** Have you bought from these before?                                                                                                                                    |
| **Interviewee:** 沒有。                                                                                                                                     | **Interviewee:** No.                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Me:** 那如果比如說，他會給妳推薦這些出版社的書本？                                                                                                        | **Me:** What if, for example, it recommends books from these publishers to you?                                                                                                |
| **Interviewee:** 可是它這些書有，有哪些...它有出過哪些書啊？隨便複製一個，「綠色書」，它這個，它沒有...它這個是，這是店面吧？                                 | **Interviewee:** But these books it has, which ones... which books has it published? Just randomly copy one, "Green Book", this one, it doesn't have... this one is, this is a storefront, right? |
| **Me:** 對啊，這是店面啊。                                                                                                                                  | **Me:** Yeah, this is a storefront.                                                                                                                                           |
| **Interviewee:** 對，它推薦的是店面的品牌名稱。                                                                                                               | **Interviewee:** Right, what it recommends are the brand names of storefronts.                                                                                                |
| **Me:** 所以妳相信它跟妳講的這些嗎？ (註: TXT 誤聽為 信號)                                                                                                    | **Me:** So do you believe what it told you? (Note: TXT misheard as "signals")                                                                                                |
| **Interviewee:** 它出...喔，出三采？反正真的有的應該是相信的。因為畢竟我自己也不懂，除非就像是剛剛那個複製貼上去，現在看到發現說，好像這好像其實不是，這不是出版社，而是那個一個地點。好，對。這看起來超級不像那個的...這一本書。 | **Interviewee:** It published... oh, published Sanmin? Anyway, the ones that really exist, I should believe. Because after all, I don't know myself, unless it's like just now, copy-pasting it, now seeing it and finding out, seems like this actually isn't, this isn't a publisher, but rather that one location. Okay, right. This looks super unlike that... this one book. |
| **Me:** 好。對。好。那這樣可以了。妳再幫我拍照一下Momo跟它互動。                                                                                             | **Me:** Okay. Right. Okay. That's fine then. Help me take another photo of Momo and the interaction with it.                                                                  |

| **Me:** 什麼其他的，這個網頁，不是它一定給妳回覆的，妳幫我拍照一下。讓妳熟悉它。                                                                              | **Me:** Anything else, this webpage, not necessarily the one it replied with, help me take a photo. Let you get familiar with it.                                             |
| **Interviewee:** （拍照）...然後這邊。                                                                                                                        | **Interviewee:** (Takes photo)... And here.                                                                                                                                   |
