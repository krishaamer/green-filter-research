It's analyzing the product I want to buy, some of its introductions, and also environmental protection, environmental protection related. And also this... uh... What is this? This is... hmm, this should probably be something like stocks. |
| **Me:** 啊。那對你來說，哪一個部分最重要的？                                                                                                                | **Me:** Ah. Then for you, which part is the most important?                                                                                                                           |
| **Interviewee:** 我覺得，呃，我覺得這個介紹的比較重要。                                                                                                      | **Interviewee:** I think, uh, I think this introduction is more important.                                                                                                            |
| **Me:** 啊。那這裡，這個內容裡面的重點是什麼？                                                                                                              | **Me:** Ah. Then here, what's the main point inside this content?                                                                                                                     |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯...他在講應該是就是這雙鞋製作的時候的一些，它的用料或者是它的環保問題比較嚴重的汙染問題。                                                      | **Interviewee:** Hmm... It's talking about probably, during the production of this pair of shoes, some of its materials or its environmental issues, the more serious pollution problems. |
| **Me:** 好。那你自己的看法呢？這裡有什麼可以使用的嗎？                                                                                                      | **Me:** Okay. What about your own view? Is there anything here that can be used?                                                                                                      |
| **Interviewee:** 嗯...就是它有這個「材料可續性、可持續性」，就是他會跟你講說這雙鞋，呃，這材質的，的那個可續、可持續性，就是你會比較了解，就是如果你買了這雙鞋之後，他能，他可能對環境不太好，這樣。 | **Interviewee:** Hmm... It has this "Material Sustainability, Sustainability", meaning it will tell you about this pair of shoes, uh, this material's, its sustainability, sustainability, so you'll understand better, like if you buy this pair of shoes, it can, it might not be good for the environment, like that. |
| **Me:** 嗯。那最下面還有兩個按鈕 (註: TXT 誤聽為 按針) 可以幫我按一個嗎？如果想要。                                                                        | **Me:** Hmm. Then at the very bottom there are two buttons (Note: TXT misheard as "needles"). Can you press one for me? If you want to.                                                |
| **Interviewee:** （按下按鈕）                                                                                                                               | **Interviewee:** (Presses button)                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Me:** 那這是什麼呢？                                                                                                                                      | **Me:** What is this then?                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Interviewee:** 就是他，他跟一些其他的品牌做比較，然後他跟你講一些相較於這個品牌來講，比較更環保的其他品牌。                                                    | **Interviewee:** It's, it compares with some other brands, and then it tells you some other brands that, compared to this brand, are relatively more environmentally friendly.            |
| **Me:** 那其他的品牌你有買過嗎？                                                                                                                            | **Me:** Have you bought these other brands?                                                                                                                                           |
