"enabling data-driven decision making"

When will Bolt show CO2e emissions per every trip?

Sustainable finance data platform:

As long as humanity is a mono-planetary species, we have to come to terms with the limitations of our home, Earth, which is becoming increasingly urbanized. 

"The study employed a mixed-methods approach, starting with a , followed by . A survey of 900 college students across 21 universities in Taiwan was then conducted to understand . The major contribution is the interactive AI-assistant prototype, informed by the design research findings.

Prototype informed by design research aims to empower young adults to make informed decisions that align with their environmental values, whether through sustainable shopping, saving, or investing.

In-person face-to-face testing with 32 students at 7 universities provided additional changed in the app design. It allowed to better understand the struggles students face with technology: old laptops, slow wi-fi, lack of power plugs and dieing batteries.

Designing AI systems that are capable of translating complex environmental data into actionable insights.

In conclusion, this research addresses the need for convenient tools to enable college students to take sustainable financial actions in their daily lives. By leveraging advancements in AI and data-driven interaction design, the proposed AI companion aims to act as a translation layer between complex environmental data and human-comprehensible language. The prototype demonstrates how thoughtful design can empower the next generation to align their consumption and investment behaviors with their concern for the environment, driving positive change through their financial choices."

## RQ1: What design considerations should be addressed when designing an AI companion for college students integrating sustainability and finance?

***From Literature Review.***

A comprehensive literature review in the interconnected economic behavior and ecological sustainability underscores the critical role that financial decisions play in impacting the planet's health.

## RQ2: How can AI companions support college students with sustainability knowledge in the context of financial decisions?	

***From Literature Review, User Survey, Expert Interviews, and User Testing the Prototype.***

*Design for Visibility & Simplicity*
Testers often overlooked the AI analysis feature, thinking it was part of the website, not a 3rd party service. The interface must make key actions obvious. Use prominent announcements to announce new features (e.g. a pop‐up tour highlighting what's new). Minimize extra clicks: as one expert (Huang) noted, "people are lazy... if it’s easier to get the information that I don’t have to click a button, I will pay attention". In short, design a streamlined UI with clear one-step interactions and in-context prompts.

*Design for Intuitive Visuals & Feedback*
Replace dense text with clear graphics and simple ratings. Huang observed that users tune out long reports but immediately grasp an icon or "eco score" (e.g. a polar bear or 0–100 scale). Similarly, testers noticed numeric eco-scores  more than textual features. Thus, represent sustainability metrics as concise visuals or scores, with brief tooltips explaining meaning.

*Design for Engaging Tone & Fun Elements*
Use approachable language and interactive cues. Experts advised avoiding jargon: e.g. change button text from “Continue discussion” to a playful prompt to spark curiosity and intriguing to capture user interest. Gamification (e.g. progress bars, “unlocking” sustainable tips) may sustain engagement, given users’ limited patience for lengthy explanations.

*Design for Trust and Transparency*
Students expressed moderate trust in AI (survey results show many neutral-to-skeptical responses). To build credibility, the companion must cite verifiable data (certifications, carbon labels, etc.) rather than vague claims. For example, testers distrusted offsetting alone (“I still feel like I'm not really doing it right” when just buying carbon credits.), so the app should provide concrete evidence of impact. Avoid taking ESG scores at face value – include context (e.g. B Corp or supply-chain data) as advised by literature. In practice, feature designs should highlight third-party credentials (green certifications) and explain methodology to counter skepticism.

*Design Mobile-First*
For technical reasons the prototype testing was done using laptop computers (Apple does not allow adding 3rd party overlays on iOS apps the same way Google allows with Chrome Browser Extensions). However, given 96% of students use smartphones (majority iOS), mobile-first is a must, even given all the technical limitations. The design should favor a mobile app or browser extension that integrates with their existing shopping/payment tools. Survey clustering suggests leveraging daily habits (shopping/savings apps) as entry points. Ensure compatibility (notably, iOS imposes browser restrictions) and consider platform-specific design (e.g. integrating with Momo app interface as envisioned). Shopee was consistenly mentioned by testers and could serve for the next round of testing instead of Momo.

## RQ3: What AI companion features do college students prioritize as the highest?

*From Survey of College Students.*

Survey results from 900 college students across universities in the Northern, Western, Southern and Eastern parts of Taiwan highlights the concern among young adults regarding environmental degradation. However, my survey results acknowledges the barriers these individuals face, including a lack of tools and clear information, which hinders their ability to contribute effectively to environmental sustainability.

Their preferences and attitudes.

College students are concerned with environmental issues but lack tools to affect systemic change. This research introduces an AI companion to help young adults engage in sustainable shopping, saving, and investing.

College students can set their *Intention* and the AI companion can help them fulfill that intention in a variety of financial situation from shopping to saving and investing.

## Final Takeaway

The consumer element doesn't have enough money by itself but it can make financial tools work better (higher baseline) to galvanize and encourage institutional investment into sustainability.
