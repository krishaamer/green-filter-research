# Methodology

Start with expert survey, then expert interviews (because so many
questions from literature review).

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[0] }} />

I adopted a face-to-face method to increase response rates distributing
flyers to students on college campuses, canteens, and classrooms getting
verbal permission from educators in their ´ classrooms to distribute the
survey flyer. The flyer included a colorful AI-generated visual with a
futuristic game-link female figure, the title “climate anxiety survey”,
a website link (ziran.tw) and scannable QR-code.

Similarly to (Liu et al., 2023) I distributed the survey in schools in
the Northern, Soutern, Central, and East regions of Taiwan.

The survey only included questions and descriptions in Chinese. I have
used the Claude 3 Opus model to translate them to English for this
table.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[1] }} />

Respondents who remained outside the survey parameters were disregarded
from the data analysis. References were stored in the Zotero paid
version with 6 GB storage. Bibtex and Better Bibtex were used to export
the references to the .bib format consumable by Quarto.

## Research Design

When developing my research design, I relied on the advice of (Christian
Rohrer, 2022) to decide when to choose which User-Experience Research
methods.s

**The research design of this study consists of 3 steps.**

-   Qualitative research targeted at financial and interaction design
    experts, leading to a *wish list* of features.
-   Survey potential users’ preferences, including a choice experiment
    of the proposed features.
-   Design a prototype of the personal sustainable finance AI assistant,
    tested using qualitative methods in a focus group.
-   This mixed-method research design is divided into three stages
    (fig. 11).
-   My purpose for the first qualitative stage is to explore the general
    themes arising from the literature review related to the design of
    AI advisors for investing. I will identify specific user experience
    factors, through interviewing experts in financial technology and
    user experience design and reviewing existing applications on the
    marketplace. At this stage in the research, the central concept
    being studied is defined generally as expectations towards a
    sustainable investment AI advisor.
-   I will then proceed to the second, quantitative stage, informed by
    the previously identified factors, and prepare a survey, including a
    Likert scale, and a choice experiment, focusing on the preferences
    of the potential users in generation-z aged 18-29, living in Taiwan
    (see fig. 12 on next page), exploring the relationship between
    independent variables: - “Interest in Sustainability” - “Interest in
    Investing” - “Preferred Features” - and the dependent variable “User
    Sign-ups”.
-   In the third stage, I will return to the qualitative methods, by
    building a prototype of the sustainable investing AI companion,
    taking into account insights gathered in the previous stage. I will
    use a focus group to discuss the prototype, and conduct a thematic
    analysis of the discussions’ recordings, leading to further
    validation of previously gathered data and possible changes in the
    prototype. The gained insights, accompanied by the app prototype,
    which embodies my findings, will be the final outcome of my
    research.

## Conceptual Framework

The conceptual framework map presents the key concepts arising from the
literature review thus far in the research process. I’m using these
concepts when developing interview strategies for phase one of the
research, developing the survey questionnaire for phase two, as well as
for building the Personal Sustainable AI Financial Advisor (PSAA) for
young adults at the final stage of the process. However, I expect the
conceptual framework to further evolve with additional findings while
conducting my research.

Conceptual Model

## Research Methods

### Phase One - Qualitative Research

The qualitative research methods employed in the first stage of the
research design enables me to explore concepts arising for literature
review further, using a more open approach, without limiting the
conversation only to pre-ascribed notions. The strength of the
qualitative approach in the first stage is to encourage the discovery of
new ideas, not yet common in literature and potential user experience
factors related to sustainable investing and user experience.

**Sampling**

My qualitative sampling structure uses non-probability snowball
sampling, with the following criteria: financial industry, fintech, and
design experts everywhere, including in Taiwan and Sweden, but also
Estonia, Portugal, and elsewhere.

**Method:** Semi-Structured Interviews

I will conduct exploratory research in English using semi-structured
interviews recorded online and offline.

### Phase Two - Quantitative Research

The strength of quantitative research is to enable me to access a larger
sample of potential users in two countries, using online survey methods,
and to validate some of the qualitative findings from stage one.

**Sampling** My quantitative sampling structure uses a judgmental
criterion: adults aged in Generation-Z (18-29), located in Taiwan,
surveyed using a Chinese-language online survey.

**Method:** Likert The survey includes a Likert scale between 1 to 5 to
validate key findings from the first stage of the research by assessing
responses to statements regarding the app’s design, features, and other
criteria that may still emerge.

**Method:** Choice Experiment The survey includes a choice experiment
between different sets of potential features available when
communicating with the sustainable finance AI companion.

### Phase Three - Qualitative Research

In the last phase, I will return to the qualitative methods to further
validate the quantitative findings from stage two. Here my focus will be
on operationalizing the gathered insights into a prototype that users
can experiment with and discuss with their peers in a focus group
setting.

**Sampling**

The phase three sampling structure uses a judgmental criterion: - age
Gen-Z cohort - located in Taiwan - Using the Chinese language for
discussion.

Individual face-to-face interviews were organized at universities around
Taiwan. Because in-person presence is required in this stage, the
prototype will only be tested by potential users physically present in
Taiwan. To avoid convenience sampling, I posted online ads in Chinese
and reach out to varied student clubs to invite people who I don’t know
personally, to participate in a “sustainable AI application testing”
(wording may change).

**Method:** Focus Group The strength of a focus group is the ability to
observe potential users in a social setting, where knowledge can be
exchanged between the participants. The whole experience, including
emerging conversations, will be recorded and transcribed.

**Method:** Thematic Analysis Finally, I will perform a thematic
analysis of the focus group transcriptions in order to validate previous
findings, and open avenues for future research.

Interview transcripts from Descript and Google Speech-to-Text model were
combined using Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental 03-25
(gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25) model.

## Testing

Does the prototype match user needs?

Testing was the most difficult part of the thesis process.

-   Testing with random people found at the university.

-   Testing with experts.

-   Testing with unknown people in the target audience.

### App Testing Flow

### 1st Wave of Testing (Spring 2024) {#st-wave-of-testing-spring-2024}

-   1 month from 2024 April 2 to May 2, 2024
-   8 anonymous participants at NCKU
-   Participant observation
-   No audio recording

### 2nd Wave of Testing (Autumn 2024 - Spring 2025) {#nd-wave-of-testing-autumn-2024---spring-2025}

In-Person Face-to-Face Testing

I conducted in-person testing individually with 32 students at 7
universities. Interviews were conducted in Chinese and transcribed and
translated to English using Google Voice to Text AI as well as Describe
AI. Face-to-face testing was concluded in several universities across
Taiwan.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[2] }} />

### Expert Feedback

Talk to 5 experts over video call and 1 one face-to-face in English;
record, transcribe, and perform thematic analysis of the contents.
