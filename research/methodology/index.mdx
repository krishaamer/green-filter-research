# Methodology

Start with expert survey, then expert interviews (because so many
questions from literature review).

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[0] }} />

I adopted a face-to-face method to increase response rates distributing
flyers to students on college campuses, canteens, and classrooms getting
verbal permission from educators in their ´ classrooms to distribute the
survey flyer. The flyer included a colorful AI-generated visual with a
futuristic game-link female figure, the title “climate anxiety survey”,
a website link (ziran.tw) and scannable QR-code.

Similarly to (Liu et al., 2023) I distributed the survey in schools in
the Northern, Soutern, Central, and East regions of Taiwan.

The survey only included questions and descriptions in Chinese. I have
used the Claude 3 Opus model to translate them to english for this
table.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[1] }} />

Respondents who remained outside the survey parameters were disregarded
from the data analysis.

## Research Design

-   Christian Rohrer (2022): Research methods

**The research design of this study consists of 3 steps.**

-   Qualitative research targeted at financial and interaction design
    experts, leading to a *wish list* of features.
-   Survey potential users’ preferences, including a choice experiment
    of the proposed features.
-   Design a prototype of the personal sustainable finance AI assistant,
    tested using qualitative methods in a focus group.
-   This mixed-method research design is divided into three stages
    (fig. 11).
-   My purpose for the first qualitative stage is to explore the general
    themes arising from the literature review related to the design of
    AI advisors for investing. I will identify specific user experience
    factors, through interviewing experts in financial technology and
    user experience design and reviewing existing applications on the
    marketplace. At this stage in the research, the central concept
    being studied is defined generally as expectations towards a
    sustainable investment AI advisor.
-   I will then proceed to the second, quantitative stage, informed by
    the previously identified factors, and prepare a survey, including a
    Likert scale, and a choice experiment, focusing on the preferences
    of the potential users aged 18-35, living in Sweden and Taiwan (see
    fig. 12 on next page), exploring the relationship between
    independent variables: - “Interest in Sustainability” - “Interest in
    Investing” - “Preferred Features” - and the dependent variable “User
    Sign-ups”.
-   In the third stage, I will return to the qualitative methods, by
    building a prototype of the sustainable investing AI companion,
    taking into account insights gathered in the previous stage. I will
    use a focus group to discuss the prototype, and conduct a thematic
    analysis of the discussions’ recordings, leading to further
    validation of previously gathered data and possible changes in the
    prototype. The gained insights, accompanied by the app prototype,
    which embodies my findings, will be the final outcome of my
    research.

## Conceptual Framework

-   The conceptual framework map (fig. 13) presents the key concepts
    arising from the literature review thus far in the research process.
    I’m using these concepts when developing interview strategies for
    phase one of the research, developing the survey questionnaire for
    phase two, as well as for building the Personal Sustainable AI
    Financial Advisor (PSAA) for young adults at the final stage of the
    process. However, I expect the conceptual framework to further
    evolve with additional findings while conducting my research.

Conceptual Model

## Research Methods

### Phase One - Qualitative Research

The qualitative research methods employed in the first stage of the
research design enables me to explore concepts arising for literature
review further, using a more open approach, without limiting the
conversation only to pre-ascribed notions. The strength of the
qualitative approach in the first stage is to encourage the discovery of
new ideas, not yet common in literature and potential user experience
factors related to sustainable investing and user experience.

#### Sampling

My qualitative sampling structure uses non-probability snowball
sampling, with the following criteria: financial industry, fintech, and
design experts everywhere, including in Taiwan and Sweden, but also
Estonia, Portugal, and elsewhere.

**Method:** Semi-Structured Interviews

I will conduct exploratory research in English using semi-structured
interviews recorded online and offline.

### Phase Two - Quantitative Research

The strength of quantitative research is to enable me to access a larger
sample of potential users in two countries, using online survey methods,
and to validate some of the qualitative findings from stage one.

**Sampling** My quantitative sampling structure uses a judgmental
criterion: age 18-35, located in Sweden or Taiwan, surveyed using an
English-language online survey.

**Method:** Likert The survey includes a Likert scale between 1 to 7 to
validate key findings from the first stage of the research by assessing
responses to statements regarding the app’s design, features, and other
criteria that may still emerge.

**Method:** Choice Experiment The survey includes a choice experiment
between different sets of potential features available when
communicating with the sustainable finance AI companion.

### Phase Three - Qualitative Research

In the last phase, I will return to the qualitative methods to further
validate the quantitative findings from stage two. Here my focus will be
on operationalizing the gathered insights into a prototype that users
can experiment with and discuss with their peers in a focus group
setting. Sampling

The phase three sampling structure uses a judgmental criterion: - age
18-35 - located in Taiwan - Using the English language for discussion

A focus group of 6 to 10 people will be gathered in Tainan. Because
in-person presence is required in this stage, the prototype will only be
tested by potential users physically present in Taiwan. To avoid
convenience sampling, I will post online ads in English to invite people
who I don’t know personally, to participate in a “financial AI
application testing group” (wording may change).

**Method:** Focus Group The strength of a focus group is the ability to
observe potential users in a social setting, where knowledge can be
exchanged between the participants. The whole experience, including
emerging conversations, will be recorded and transcribed.

**Method:** Thematic Analysis Finally, I will perform a thematic
analysis of the focus group transcriptions in order to validate previous
findings, and open avenues for future research.
