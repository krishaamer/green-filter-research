# Methodology

Start with expert survey, then expert interviews (because so many questions from literature review).

| Group                              | Task                       |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Experts (Finance)                  | Interview                  |
| Experts (Design)                   | Interview                  |
| Experts (Sustainability)           | Interview                  |
| Target Audience (College Students) | Survey + Prototype Testing |

I adopted a face-to-face method to increase response rates distributing flyers to students on college campuses, canteens, and classrooms getting verbal permission from educators in their ´ classrooms to distribute the survey flyer. The flyer included a colorful AI-generated visual with a futuristic game-link female figure, the title "climate anxiety survey", a website link (ziran.tw) and scannable QR-code.

Similarly to [@liuDigitalCapabilityDigital2023] I distributed the survey in schools in the Northern, Soutern, Central, and East regions of Taiwan.

The survey only included questions and descriptions in Chinese. I have used the Claude 3 Opus model to translate them to English for this table.

-   Bibtex and Better Bibtex were used to export the references to the .bib format consumable by Quarto.

## Research Design

When developing my research design, I relied on the advice of [@christianrohrerWhenUseWhich2022] to decide when to choose which User-Experience Research methods.s

**The research design of this study consists of 3 steps.**

-   Qualitative research targeted at financial and interaction design experts, leading to a *wish list* of features.
-   Survey potential users' preferences, including a choice experiment of the proposed features.
-   Design a prototype of the personal sustainable finance AI assistant, tested using qualitative methods in a focus group.
-   This mixed-method research design is divided into three stages (fig. 11).
-   My purpose for the first qualitative stage is to explore the general themes arising from the literature review related to the design of AI advisors for investing. I will identify specific user experience factors, through interviewing experts in financial technology and user experience design and reviewing existing applications on the marketplace. At this stage in the research, the central concept being studied is defined generally as expectations towards a sustainable investment AI advisor.
-   I will then proceed to the second, quantitative stage, informed by the previously identified factors, and prepare a survey, including a Likert scale, and a choice experiment, focusing on the preferences of the potential users in generation-z aged 18-29, living in Taiwan (see fig. 12 on next page), exploring the relationship between independent variables: - "Interest in Sustainability" - "Interest in Investing" - "Preferred Features" - and the dependent variable "User Sign-ups".
-   In the third stage, I will return to the qualitative methods, by building a prototype of the sustainable investing AI companion, taking into account insights gathered in the previous stage. I will use a focus group to discuss the prototype, and conduct a thematic analysis of the discussions' recordings, leading to further validation of previously gathered data and possible changes in the prototype. The gained insights, accompanied by the app prototype, which embodies my findings, will be the final outcome of my research.

## Conceptual Framework

-   The conceptual framework map presents the key concepts arising from the literature review thus far in the research process. I'm using these concepts when developing interview strategies for phase one of the research, developing the survey questionnaire for phase two, as well as for building the Personal Sustainable AI Financial Advisor (PSAA) for young adults at the final stage of the process. However, I expect the conceptual framework to further evolve with additional findings while conducting my research.

Conceptual Model

## Research Methods

### Phase One - Qualitative Research

The qualitative research methods employed in the first stage of the research design enables me to explore concepts arising for literature review further, using a more open approach, without limiting the conversation only to pre-ascribed notions. The strength of the qualitative approach in the first stage is to encourage the discovery of new ideas, not yet common in literature and potential user experience factors related to sustainable investing and user experience.

#### Sampling

My qualitative sampling structure uses non-probability snowball sampling, with the following criteria: financial industry, fintech, and design experts everywhere, including in Taiwan and Sweden, but also Estonia, Portugal, and elsewhere.

**Method:** Semi-Structured Interviews

I will conduct exploratory research in English using semi-structured interviews recorded online and offline.

### Phase Two - Quantitative Research

The strength of quantitative research is to enable me to access a larger sample of potential users in two countries, using online survey methods, and to validate some of the qualitative findings from stage one.

**Sampling** My quantitative sampling structure uses a judgmental criterion: adults aged in Generation-Z (18-29), located in Taiwan, surveyed using a Chinese-language online survey.

**Method:** Likert The survey includes a Likert scale between 1 to 5 to validate key findings from the first stage of the research by assessing responses to statements regarding the app's design, features, and other criteria that may still emerge.

**Method:** Choice Experiment The survey includes a choice experiment between different sets of potential features available when communicating with the sustainable finance AI companion.

### Phase Three - Qualitative Research

In the last phase, I will return to the qualitative methods to further validate the quantitative findings from stage two. Here my focus will be on operationalizing the gathered insights into a prototype that users can experiment with and discuss with their peers in a focus group setting. Sampling

The phase three sampling structure uses a judgmental criterion: - age 18-35 - located in Taiwan - Using the Chinese language for discussion

Individual face-to-face interviews with be organized at universities around Taiwan. Because in-person presence is required in this stage, the prototype will only be tested by potential users physically present in Taiwan. To avoid convenience sampling, I will post online ads in Chinese and reach out to varied student clubs to invite people who I don't know personally, to participate in a "sustainable AI application testing" (wording may change).

**Method:** Focus Group The strength of a focus group is the ability to observe potential users in a social setting, where knowledge can be exchanged between the participants. The whole experience, including emerging conversations, will be recorded and transcribed.

**Method:** Thematic Analysis Finally, I will perform a thematic analysis of the focus group transcriptions in order to validate previous findings, and open avenues for future research.

-   Interview transcript from Descript and Google Speech-to-Text model were combined using Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental 03-25 (gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25) model.

## Testing

Does the prototype match user needs?

Testing was the most difficult part of the thesis process.

-   Testing with friends and acquaintances.

-   Testing with experts.

-   Testing with unknown people in the target audience.

| may3 - first looked for NET clothes but Momo doesn't sell it - Looked for Sony camera lens |

1 may prof suggestion - make connection between biodibersity and production and consumption clearer - what is the incentive for companies to share their data?

my own idea: like the switch of going from traditional banking with ATM machines on the street (or even the physica bank office) to online banking with mobile payments

-   hypothesis: esg accessibility can push companies to increase production standards

-   what if you can see ESG in near-realtime such as the stock market price

-   i can imagine esg derivative product like siemens gamesa

-   ai can help integrate esg derivatives into daily life to drive esg adoption

-   "effective altruism (EA)"

-   "Blockchain technology can improve price transparency in product distribution by allowing consumers to know the exact pricing from raw materials to distributors to suppliers."

-   

Interviews and testing survey were conducted anonymously in hopes to have more honest responses from the responders.

-   ziran chrome extension is unable to record activity due to browser security restrictions for plugins
-   ai.ziran.tw record user activity
-   semi-structured interviews were conducted in chinese
-   the interviewer (me) took notes of the interviews
-   some gaps in the data exist due to the limited chinese language skills of the interviewer (me)

basic interview script - momo: what is a brand that you like'd or would like to buy - search - please pick a product (or search again) - on product page: what do you notice on this page? - what kind of information is important for you on this page? - do you notice anything else - (if the user doesn't notice the green filter, direct their attention to it and ask: what do you think this does?) - would you click on it - if the user says yes, continue - if thhe user says no, make note and continue - as the extension generates a response: what do you think about this content? - is there any information that you consider important? - anything else you see that you think looks special - do you see anywhere you can click? - would you click on it? - if yes, continue - if no, make note, and continue - explain: due to the limitation of the prototype, the test will continue on a separate page where you can ask questions - is there anything you would like to ask the helper? - notice if the user picks from sample questions - remind the user they can come up with their own question - as the ai is generating content ask: do you see any information in this content - did you know this before or is there any info you didn't know before? make note. - front page: explain the helper takes into account your personal info and goals. - ask: what kind of information do you think important to share with the helper?
