# Methodology

## Research Design

[@baytas3KindsDesign2020] categorizes design research into three modes: (1) conducting research to inform design decisions, (2) studying designs to generate knowledge, and (3) using design itself as a means of inquiry. My research is of the 1st category, aiming to make better design decisions for my sustainability-focused financial app. When developing my research design, I relied on the advice of [@christianrohrerWhenUseWhich2022] to decide when to choose which user experience research methods.

To knit together the themes of youth finance and sustainability, with the help of interaction design and AI, this study adopts the *Theory of Planned Behavior* (TPB) as its primary analytic frame used to organize the overall results from a theoretical point of view. TPB states that the strength of a person’s intention depends on three belief clusters: (1) a cognitive and affective attitude toward the act, (2) perceived social norms, and (3) perceived behavioral control [@ajzenTheoryPlannedBehavior1991].

By foregrounding TPB I can interpret both the adoption of a financial AI companion and the subsequent shift toward sustainable shopping, saving, and investing with a single set of constructs. [@haggerProgressTheoryPlanned2025] extensive meta-meta-study (study of several underlying meta-studies) summarize 40 years of TPB research, showing strong, consistent effects of *attitude*, *subjective norm*, and *perceived behavioral control* on *intentions*, and of intentions on behavior; the effect is found to be robust across various behaviors, populations, and study designs.

The graph below shows the basic structure of TPB.

## Research Methods

Overview of research methods.

| Group                              | Task              |
|------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Experts (Finance)                  | Interview         |
| Experts (Design)                   | Interview         |
| Experts (Sustainability)           | Interview         |
| Target Audience (College Students) | Survey            |
| Target Audience (College Students) | Prototype Testing |

This mixed-method research design is divided into three stages.

### Phase One - Qualitative Research

My purpose for the first qualitative stage is to explore the general themes arising from the literature review related to the design of AI advisors for investing. I identified specific user experience factors, through interviewing experts in financial technology and user experience design and reviewing existing applications on the marketplace. At this stage in the research, the central concept being studied was defined generally as expectations towards a sustainable investment AI advisor.

I started with literature review, which led into expert interviews (there were many questions arising from the literature). I identified key concepts from expert discussions and gained exposure to their industry insights.

The qualitative research methods employed in the first stage of the research design enables me to explore concepts arising for literature review further, using a more open approach, without limiting the conversation only to pre-ascribed notions. The strength of the qualitative approach in the first stage is to encourage the discovery of new ideas, not yet common in literature and potential user experience factors related to sustainable investing and user experience.

#### Sampling

My qualitative sampling structure used non-probability snowball sampling, with the following criteria: targeting financial industry, fintech, design, and sustainability experts; located everywhere.

#### Methods

I conducted exploratory research in English using semi-structured interviews recorded online and offline. I talked to 5 experts over video call, 1 expert face-to-face, and 1 expert over WhatsApp voice messages; 6 interviews were conducted in English and 1 in Portuguese. I recorded audio and video, transcribed the conversations. I used OpenAI's o3 model to translate the Portuguese interview to English. I then performed thematic analysis across all the contents, leading to a *wish list* of features.

| Interview Mode      | Number of Experts | Language   | Recording Method |
|---------------------|-------------------|------------|------------------|
| Video Call          | 5                 | English    | Audio & Video    |
| Face-to-Face        | 1                 | English    | Audio & Video    |
| WhatsApp Voice Msgs | 1                 | Portuguese | Audio            |

Thematic analysis coding was developed using Atlas.ti "Intentional AI Coding" feature, using the following prompt:

> "How do industry experts describe their design and sustainability principles, AI and technology strategies? What common language emerges between design, sustainability, finance, and AI? Identify passages where experts link system thinking, transparency, simplicity, feedback loops, and long term impact across design, sustainability, AI, and finance." - Prompt for Atlas.ti "Intentional AI Coding"

Specific questions generated by Atlast.ti from the prompt, which guide the AI coding.

| Question | Category |
|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| How do industry experts describe their design and sustainability principles? | Design Principles |
| What AI and technology strategies do industry experts employ? | AI Strategies |
| What common language emerges between design, sustainability, finance, and AI? | Common Language |
| How do experts link systems thinking across design, sustainability, AI, and finance? | System Thinking |
| In what ways do experts emphasize transparency in their discussions on design, sustainability, AI, and finance? | Transparency |
| How is simplicity articulated by experts in relation to design, sustainability, AI, and finance? | Simplicity |
| What role do feedback loops play in the experts' frameworks for design, sustainability, AI, and finance? | Feedback Loops |
| How do experts define long term impact in the context of design, sustainability, AI, and finance? | Long term Impact |

#### Conceptual Framework

The conceptual framework map presents the key concepts arising from the literature review thus far in the research process. I'm using these concepts when developing interview strategies for phase one of the research, developing the survey questionnaire for phase two, as well as for building the Green Filter AI Companion for young adults at the final stage of the process. However, I expect the conceptual framework to further evolve with additional findings while conducting my research.

### Phase Two - Quantitative Research

I then proceeded to the second, quantitative stage, informed by the previously identified factors, and prepared a survey to understand potential users' preferences, including a Likert scale, a choice experiment, and a selection of proposed features, focusing on the preferences of the potential users in Gen-Z, aged 18-29, living in Taiwan.

#### Sampling

My quantitative sampling structure uses a judgmental criterion: adults aged in Gen-Z (18-29), located in Taiwan, surveyed using a Chinese-language online survey.

#### Methods

Likert: The survey includes a Likert scale between 1 to 5 to validate key findings from the first stage of the research by assessing responses to statements regarding the app's design, features, and other criteria that may still emerge.

Choice Experiment: The survey includes a *choice experiment* between different sets of potential features available when communicating with the sustainable finance AI companion.

#### Survey Development and Expected Findings

In December 2020, in preparation for the final version of the survey, I ran a preliminary questionnaire, testing open-ended and close-ended questions, as way to prepare for the proposal of this research. I conducted a preliminary round of face-to-face interviews using 21 open-ended, probing questions and a convenience sampling of NCKU foreign students (n = 12) on campus between ages 19 and 29. The interviews were conducted in English and lasted between 9 and 21 minutes; they gave me some initial feedback on my research idea, the respondents' daily routines, app usage, and feelings towards financial questions, including investing, relationship with nature, and environmental sustainability

This preliminary version of the survey was only used to develop the questionnaire itself and the data collected (even though the recorded audio was transcribed), is not part of the research results. These preliminary conversations led me to emphasize more on the financial journey of the user, i.e. to consider the importance of the shopping, savings, and payments, with the apps students already use daily, serving as an entry point to becoming an investor (this approach later became known as embedded finance). I expected my future research findings to confirm this initial idea and to offer diverse ways and examples of what that path could look like in practice.

I then proceeded to change my target audience to Taiwanese students and developed the survey to include more specific questions, including more close-ended multiple-choice varieties.

#### Final Survey: Data Collection

For the actual survey, I developed 63 close-ended and open-ended questions. For survey distribution, I adopted a face-to-face method to increase response rates, distributing flyers to students on college campuses, canteens, and classrooms, getting verbal permission from educators in their classrooms to distribute the survey flyer. Similarly to the approach take by [@liuDigitalCapabilityDigital2023], I distributed the survey flyer at universities located in the Northern, Soutern, Central, and East regions of Taiwan. The flyer included a colorful AI-generated visual with a futuristic game-like female figure, and the title "climate anxiety survey" in Chinese, as well as a website link (ziran.tw) and scannable QR-code.

The survey only included questions and descriptions in Chinese. I have used the Claude 3 Opus model to translate them to English for this table.

### Phase Three - Qualitative Research

In the third and last phase, I returned to qualitative methods, to further validate the quantitative findings from stage two, by building a prototype of the sustainable investing AI companion, taking into account insights gathered in the previous stage. Here my focus was on operationalizing the gathered insights into a prototype that users can experiment with. I designed and refined a prototype of the personal sustainable finance AI assistant. I used face-to-face interviews to discuss the prototype, and conducted a thematic analysis of the discussions' recordings, leading to further validation of previously gathered data and changes in the prototype. The gained insights, accompanied by the app prototype, which embodies my findings, are the final outcome of my research.

#### Sampling

The phase three sampling structure used a judgmental criterion:

-   Age Gen-Z cohort
-   Located in Taiwan
-   Using Chinese for discussion.

Individual face-to-face interviews were organized at universities around Taiwan. Because in-person presence is required in this stage, the prototype will only be tested by potential users physically present in Taiwan. To avoid convenience sampling, I posted online ads in Chinese and reach out to varied student clubs to invite people who I don't know personally, to participate in a "sustainable AI application testing" (wording may change).

#### Methods

Face-to-face prototype testing. The strength of in-person is the ability to observe potential users, where knowledge can be exchanged directly. The interviews were recorded and transcribed. Finally, I performed a thematic analysis of the interview transcriptions in order to validate previous findings, and open avenues for future research.

Interview transcripts from Descript and Google Speech-to-Text model were combined using Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental 03-25 (gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25) model.

#### Prototype Testing

Does the prototype match user needs?

Testing was the most difficult part of the thesis process.

-   Testing with random people found at the university.

-   Testing with experts.

-   Testing with unknown people in the target audience.

#### 1st Wave of (Preliminary) Prototype Testing (Spring 2024)

The 1st wave of preliminary testing took place during 1 month from 2024 April 2 to May 2, 2024 at the NCKU campus. I found 8 anonymous participants at different NCKU locations, such as the student canteens and the medical library, confirmed the people I approached were Taiwanese students studying at NCKU, and then simply asked them to test my app, using my own laptop. I made use of *participant observation* and took notes myself. There was no audio or video recording.

#### 2nd Wave of (In Production) Prototype Testing (Autumn 2024 - Spring 2025)

The 2nd wave of testing took place from Autumn 2024 to Spring 2025 and was more comprehensive. I conducted in-person face-to-face testing individually with 32 students at 7 universities. Interviews were conducted in Chinese and transcribed and translated to English using Google Voice to Text AI as well as Describe AI.
