# Methodology

Start with expert survey, then expert interviews (because so many questions from literature review). Identify key concepts from expert discussion and gain industry insights.

| Group                              | Task                       |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Experts (Finance)                  | Interview                  |
| Experts (Design)                   | Interview                  |
| Experts (Sustainability)           | Interview                  |
| Target Audience (College Students) | Survey + Prototype Testing |

I adopted a face-to-face method to increase response rates distributing flyers to students on college campuses, canteens, and classrooms getting verbal permission from educators in their ´ classrooms to distribute the survey flyer. The flyer included a colorful AI-generated visual with a futuristic game-link female figure, the title "climate anxiety survey", a website link (ziran.tw) and scannable QR-code.

Similarly to [@liuDigitalCapabilityDigital2023] I distributed the survey in schools in the Northern, Soutern, Central, and East regions of Taiwan.

The survey only included questions and descriptions in Chinese. I have used the Claude 3 Opus model to translate them to English for this table.

: 36 Likert Fields included in the survey

Respondents who remained outside the survey parameters were disregarded from the data analysis. References were stored in the Zotero paid version with 6 GB storage. Bibtex and Better Bibtex were used to export the references to the .bib format consumable by Quarto.

## Research Design

When developing my research design, I relied on the advice of [@christianrohrerWhenUseWhich2022] to decide when to choose which User-Experience Research methods.s

**The research design of this study consists of 3 steps.**

-   Qualitative research targeted at financial, design, and sustainability experts, leading to a *wish list* of features.

-   Survey potential users' preferences, including a choice experiment of the proposed features.
-   Design a prototype of the personal sustainable finance AI assistant, tested using qualitative methods in a focus group.
-   This mixed-method research design is divided into three stages (fig. 11).
-   My purpose for the first qualitative stage is to explore the general themes arising from the literature review related to the design of AI advisors for investing. I will identify specific user experience factors, through interviewing experts in financial technology and user experience design and reviewing existing applications on the marketplace. At this stage in the research, the central concept being studied is defined generally as expectations towards a sustainable investment AI advisor.
-   I will then proceed to the second, quantitative stage, informed by the previously identified factors, and prepare a survey, including a Likert scale, and a choice experiment, focusing on the preferences of the potential users in generation-z aged 18-29, living in Taiwan (see fig. 12 on next page), exploring the relationship between independent variables: - "Interest in Sustainability" - "Interest in Investing" - "Preferred Features" - and the dependent variable "User Sign-ups".
-   In the third stage, I will return to the qualitative methods, by building a prototype of the sustainable investing AI companion, taking into account insights gathered in the previous stage. I will use a focus group to discuss the prototype, and conduct a thematic analysis of the discussions' recordings, leading to further validation of previously gathered data and possible changes in the prototype. The gained insights, accompanied by the app prototype, which embodies my findings, will be the final outcome of my research.

## Conceptual Framework

The conceptual framework map presents the key concepts arising from the literature review thus far in the research process. I'm using these concepts when developing interview strategies for phase one of the research, developing the survey questionnaire for phase two, as well as for building the Personal Sustainable AI Financial Advisor (PSAA) for young adults at the final stage of the process. However, I expect the conceptual framework to further evolve with additional findings while conducting my research.

Conceptual Model

## Research Methods

### Phase One - Qualitative Research

The qualitative research methods employed in the first stage of the research design enables me to explore concepts arising for literature review further, using a more open approach, without limiting the conversation only to pre-ascribed notions. The strength of the qualitative approach in the first stage is to encourage the discovery of new ideas, not yet common in literature and potential user experience factors related to sustainable investing and user experience.

**Sampling**

My qualitative sampling structure uses non-probability snowball sampling, with the following criteria: financial industry, fintech, and design experts everywhere.

**Method:** Semi-Structured Interviews

I will conduct exploratory research in English using semi-structured interviews recorded online and offline.

### Phase Two - Quantitative Research

The strength of quantitative research is to enable me to access a larger sample of potential users in two countries, using online survey methods, and to validate some of the qualitative findings from stage one.

**Sampling** My quantitative sampling structure uses a judgmental criterion: adults aged in Generation-Z (18-29), located in Taiwan, surveyed using a Chinese-language online survey.

**Method:** Likert The survey includes a Likert scale between 1 to 5 to validate key findings from the first stage of the research by assessing responses to statements regarding the app's design, features, and other criteria that may still emerge.

**Method:** Choice Experiment The survey includes a choice experiment between different sets of potential features available when communicating with the sustainable finance AI companion.

### Phase Three - Qualitative Research

In the last phase, I will return to the qualitative methods to further validate the quantitative findings from stage two. Here my focus will be on operationalizing the gathered insights into a prototype that users can experiment with and discuss with their peers in a focus group setting. 

**Sampling**

The phase three sampling structure uses a judgmental criterion: - age Gen-Z cohort - located in Taiwan - Using the Chinese language for discussion.

Individual face-to-face interviews were organized at universities around Taiwan. Because in-person presence is required in this stage, the prototype will only be tested by potential users physically present in Taiwan. To avoid convenience sampling, I posted online ads in Chinese and reach out to varied student clubs to invite people who I don't know personally, to participate in a "sustainable AI application testing" (wording may change).

**Method:** Focus Group The strength of a focus group is the ability to observe potential users in a social setting, where knowledge can be exchanged between the participants. The whole experience, including emerging conversations, will be recorded and transcribed.

**Method:** Thematic Analysis Finally, I will perform a thematic analysis of the focus group transcriptions in order to validate previous findings, and open avenues for future research.

Interview transcripts from Descript and Google Speech-to-Text model were combined using Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental 03-25 (gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25) model.

## Testing

Does the prototype match user needs?

Testing was the most difficult part of the thesis process.

-   Testing with random people found at the university.

-   Testing with experts.

-   Testing with unknown people in the target audience.

### 1st Wave of Testing (Spring 2024)

-   1 month from 2024 April 2 to May 2, 2024
-   8 anonymous participants at NCKU
-   Participant observation
-   No audio recording

### 2nd Wave of Testing (Autumn 2024 - Spring 2025)

In-Person Face-to-Face Testing

I conducted in-person testing individually with 32 students at 7 universities. Interviews were conducted in Chinese and transcribed and translated to English using Google Voice to Text AI as well as Describe AI. Face-to-face testing was concluded in several universities across Taiwan.
