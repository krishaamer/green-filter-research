  abstract = {The renowned cultural theorist and media designer Anne Balsamo maintains that technology and culture are inseparable; those who engage in technological innovation are designing the cultures of the future. Designing Culture is a call for taking culture seriously in the design and development of innovative technologies. Balsamo contends that the wellspring of technological innovation is the technological imagination, a quality of mind that enables people to think with technology, to transform what is known into what is possible. She describes the technological imagination at work in several multimedia collaborations in which she was involved as a designer or developer. One of these entailed the creation of an interactive documentary for the NGO Forum held in conjunction with the UN World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995. (That documentary is included as a DVD in Designing Culture.) Balsamo also recounts the development of the interactive museum exhibit XFR: Experiments in the Future of Reading, created by the group RED (Research in Experimental Documents) at Xerox PARC. She speculates on what it would mean to cultivate imaginations as ingenious in creating new democratic cultural possibilities as they are in creating new kinds of technologies and digital media. Designing Culture is a manifesto for transforming educational programs and developing learning strategies adequate to the task of inspiring culturally attuned technological imaginations.},

  abstract = {Technological developments have given shape to robotic services which have forayed in the finance and investment industry in the form of Robo-advisors. Robo-advisors are in use in the developed nations since over a decade but have recently entered the developing nations, like India, since early 2015. This research explores the present state of Robo-advisory services in the Indian context and investigates how Robo-advisors can help in mitigating behavioral biases of a retail investor. The present study gives an in-depth understanding about the ability of Robo-advisory to mitigate behavioral biases from the perspective of experts. These experts are from the product development team, quality control team, middleware, or at top management level from BFSI (Banking and Financial Services Industry), IT (Information Technology), FINTECH (Finance Technology) and NBFCs (Non-Banking Finance Companies) in India. The researchers have adopted a qualitative approach, of interviewing these experts, to discover the phenomenon and gain insight about Robo-advisory services. Each interview was recorded and transcribed on word-for-word basis. The transcribed content underwent a structured content analysis, using different categories, resulting from the conducted literature review. The intent is not to generalize the findings, since the field of Robo-advisory is at a nascent stage as far as Indian market is concerned. The key findings indicate that the current focus is to increase awareness level amongst investors, by educating them and by building trust. Our conclusion emphasizes the fact that Robo-advisors still need to mitigate investor's biases while performing risk analysis and profiling the investors. Robo-advisory platforms are not yet comprehensively self-sufficient to accurately perform risk analysis for retail investors.},

  abstract = {Speculative Design is an approach that considers alternate futures for technology and society. Through prototyping and/or defining scenarios, important discussions about ethics or the impact of design on the environment and culture can be brought to the forefront of the design process. Sometimes considered alarmist and sensational, it's still a powerful tool for design.  Companies are applying this approach to business strategies or articulating visions for emerging technologies. They are speculating on everything from the future of their products to eliciting communities for input to developing new services. Speculative Design's potential for application is so diverse that it can be used as a lens to consider a more holistic approach to problems and uncover new questions about the future that we may have never asked.  Phil shares several projects from Apple's early vision of the iPad to how governments are using it to design new services today. He also covers some basic framework for how to begin looking at the future and consider all the potential factors and environments that could influence your products or services.

The bulk of the literature on environmental corporate social responsibility suggests that this type of behavior even results in higher profit. However, a product-differentiation framework with perfect competition predicts that renewable energy use has no effect on profit. This paper tests this prediction by investigating the relationship between firms' renewable energy use and profit on the basis of panel data for 920 firms over 2014\textendash 2018. We do not find evidence for an impact of renewable energy use on profit. Hence, a `win-win' in the form of higher profit and a better environment does not seem to exist. In addition, the results appear to suggest that firms do not have a positive willingness to pay for renewable energy as contribution to the environment. This implies that firms are only willing to contribute to climate-change mitigation through buying renewable energy when this is aligned with the profit-maximization objective.},

However, we know quite little about whether such action can also generate benefits for firms induced by political action, such as benefits associated with public procurement, (softer) regulatory enforcement and corporate tax breaks. We argue that citizens are more likely to support such rewards for firms that have a stronger record of environmental business conduct, express stronger commitment to future environmental action and submit such action to independent audits. The empirical analysis focuses on vehicle emissions reduction by car producers and plastic waste reduction by retailers. Choice experiments with 6726 respondents from Germany and the United States support these arguments. Our findings are surprisingly consistent across two different sociocultural and political contexts (Germany, USA), two different environmental policy domains (vehicle emissions, plastic waste) and three forms of political rewards. Whereas studies focusing on narrowly defined economic benefits (competitiveness) of environmental business conduct have become somewhat more sceptical about the magnitude and scope of such benefits, our results provide more room for optimism by pointing to other types of benefits of corporate environmental action.},

Moreover, negative affect in relation to SRI contributed as an observable factor to explain variance heterogeneity while experience in fund savings, positive product involvement as well as positive affect were not significant. Our main finding is, however, that latent behavioral characteristics of the investors are strong predictors of latent class membership thereby contributing to distinguish nontrivial investor sub-groups. We find no support for the contribution of sociodemographic characteristics. These results can serve to identify market segments so that equity fund offerings, including those related to SRI, can be mobilized, optimized and tailored to meet the demand for SRI among private investors.},

The results of DY suggest that, first, the total connectedness of 21st century technology assets and traditional common stocks is very high, and hence in the turbulent economy, there is a high probability of contemporaneous losses. Second, Bitcoin, MSCIW, MSCI US, and KFTX are net contributors of volatility shocks whereas US dollar, oil, gold, VIX, green bond and green bond select are net receivers. Therefore, Fintech and common equities are not good hedging instruments in the same portfolio. Third, the short-term witnesses higher volatility transmission than the long-term. That is, holding assets for a long-term is likely to mitigate risks whereas trading financial assets in the short-term can increase risk because of higher volatility. Fourth, the traditional assets, gold and oil, as well as modern assets, green bonds, are useful as good hedgers compared with other assets because shock transmissions from them to Fintech, KFTX are below 0.1\% and, more importantly, the total volatility spill-over of all assets in the sample is moderately average, accounting for 44.39\%.},

Both advice tasks are increasingly offered through automated online technologies. Little is known, however, about what drives individuals' acceptance of such automated financial advice and, from a consumer point of view, which firms may be best positioned to provide such advice. We generate novel insights on these questions by conducting a real-world empirical study using an interactive automated online tool that employs an innovative computer algorithm to build pension investment profiles, the ``Pension Builder,'' and a large, representative sample. We focus on the role that two key firm characteristics have on consumer acceptance of pension investment advice generated by computer algorithms running on automated interactive online tools: profit orientation and role in the sales channel. We find that consumers' perceptions of trust and expertise of the firm providing the automated advice are important drivers of advice acceptance (besides a strong impact of the satisfaction with the consumer\textendash online tool interaction), and that these constructs themselves are clearly influenced by the for-profit vs. not-for-profit orientation and the product provider vs. advisor only role in the sales channel of the firm providing the advice. We discuss the implications of our findings for marketers and policy makers and provide suggestions for future research.},

  abstract = {Business researchers use experimental methods extensively due to their high internal validity. However, controlled laboratory and crowdsourcing settings often introduce issues of artificiality, data contamination, and low managerial relevance of the dependent variables. Field experiments can overcome these issues but are traditionally time- and resource-consuming. This primer presents an alternative experimental setting to conduct online field experiments in a time- and cost-effective way. It does so by introducing the Facebook A/B split test functionality, which allows for random assignment of manipulated variables embedded in ecologically-valid stimuli. We compare and contrast this method against laboratory settings and Amazon Mechanical Turk in terms of design flexibility, managerial relevance, data quality control, and sample representativeness. We then provide an empirical demonstration of how to set up, pre-test, run, and analyze FBST experiments.},

  abstract = {We submit that the safe operating space of the planetary boundary of novel entities is exceeded since annual production and releases are increasing at a pace that outstrips the global capacity for assessment and monitoring. The novel entities boundary in the planetary boundaries framework refers to entities that are novel in a geological sense and that could have large-scale impacts that threaten the integrity of Earth system processes. We review the scientific literature relevant to quantifying the boundary for novel entities and highlight plastic pollution as a particular aspect of high concern. An impact pathway from production of novel entities to impacts on Earth system processes is presented. We define and apply three criteria for assessment of the suitability of control variables for the boundary: feasibility, relevance, and comprehensiveness. We propose several complementary control variables to capture the complexity of this boundary, while acknowledging major data limitations. We conclude that humanity is currently operating outside the planetary boundary based on the weight-of-evidence for several of these control variables. The increasing rate of production and releases of larger volumes and higher numbers of novel entities with diverse risk potentials exceed societies' ability to conduct safety related assessments and monitoring. We recommend taking urgent action to reduce the harm associated with exceeding the boundary by reducing the production and releases of novel entities, noting that even so, the persistence of many novel entities and/or their associated effects will continue to pose a threat.},

  abstract = {Stock market price prediction has improved due to social network activity since social networks can provide useful information, for example, on message sentiment. Few studies have analysed the influence of social networks on the bond market, and even fewer have specifically analysed the influence on the green bond market. By financing environmental projects that promote sustainability, green bonds are becoming increasingly important because of their relationship with major issues, such as climate change and water management. In addition, increases in people's environmental awareness have led companies to enact corporate social responsibility policies and environmentally sustainable projects. This context supports the relevance of this research because although there have been previous studies on green bonds, there is a scarcity of manuscripts that relate green bonds with social media and, more specifically, with investors' sentiments. Therefore, using panel data analysis, the aim of this study is to analyze how the investor sentiment extracted from social networks influences the green bond market. The results of this manuscript should lead investors and markets to consider social networks as relevant sources of information not only for the equity market but also for the bond market, specifically the green bond market.},

  abstract = {Africa is one of the fastest growing mobile phone markets in the world with more than 630 million mobile subscribers and the lowest mobile penetration rate at 63.9\% (2014). It is experiencing an unprecedented growth in sectors such as health, education, agriculture and citizen participation thanks to mobile technology. Local developers and entrepreneurs with the right set of skills have an important role to play in the creation of mobile services solving local problems. However, very few multi-year capacity building initiatives on mobile app development exist in the region, and universities are often slow in offering new curricula. In this paper, we present and evaluate a model of teaching mobile app development that was implemented in Senegal and used in the last six years through the MobileSenegal project. We determined the impact of this capacity building effort on participants and the Senegalese tech ecosystem by administering a survey in year five, and systematically analyzing the mobile solutions they designed throughout the years. Our findings show that participants are trained with skills that are valuable in the Senegalese job market and MobileSenegal responds to a specific need in the Senegalese tech ecosystem that is not covered by other initiatives. Further directions of MobileSenegal and its sustainability are outlined.},
