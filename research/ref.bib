This paper investigates the factors that can enhance consumers' ability to dispose of potentially harmful products sustainably. In a field experiment we demonstrate that the physical proximity to a drop-off point enhances the sustainability of consumer disposal of harmful products. We show that the influence of proximity on disposal behaviour is magnified if the consequences of disposal are described using metaphors. An online experiment complements these findings by showing that processing fluency \textendash{} the ease to process information - is the mechanism behind this effect. These results provide practical implications for policy-makers and managers who want to enhance sustainable disposal of harmful products, underlying the critical importance of the simplicity of the disposal initiatives and the need to strategically place drop-off bins throughout the city.},

As most of the educational institutions have been closed since March and the learning process in higher education has moved online, therefore, developing countries like Bangladesh are also trying to continue classes through the online platform with a lack of technological resources, readiness, and inclusiveness from the perspective of the students. This quantitative study surveyed over 844 students of different universities of Bangladesh to analyze the status of preparedness, participation, and classroom activities through online during the pandemic. The findings revealed a lack of preparedness, participation, and less scope of classroom activities through online learning. Problems of infeasible consistency of the internet and electricity, paying attention, understanding lessons through the online platform are the main constraints of online learning in the developing country. Finding ways of mitigating these problems can be the next subject for further researchers.},

  abstract = {Following the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in China in late December 2019, more than 217 countries became almost immediately infected in the resulting pandemic. Consequently, many of them decided to close their educational institutions as a way of preventing the spread of this virus. For many of them, though, the closure made them unable to deliver learning materials to students owing to their inability to provide the right technology for the purpose. To assist with the digitalizing of learning during this time, this study reviews the most common technologies used in the delivery of learning materials, with the experience of most infected countries being considered. Major challenges in online learning are discussed in this study as well. Further, Saudi Arabia was considered as a case study for the effectiveness of distance learning during the 2020 spring semester, where 300 undergraduate students were surveyed on their opinions of distance learning. The responses to the survey indicated that distance learning was effective in providing the required knowledge to the students during the outbreak of COVID-19. The findings showed that although the lack of interaction and poor internet connections were factors affecting comfortable and successful learning of physics and mathematics, 63\% of students were satisfied with learning management systems, 75\% of students found it easy to understand course materials, and 67\% of students found it easy to understand assignments and could deal with them comfortably. The study findings can encourage educational institutions to digitalize their learning materials in the future.},

  abstract = {Bangladesh electricity sector suffers from heavy subsidization of fossil fuels and regulated electricity prices. These interventions distort the fuel mix in electricity production, promote overconsumption of fossil fuels and slow down the low-carbon transition. As a signatory of the 2015 UNFCCC Paris Agreement, Bangladesh has pledged to reduce GHG emissions by 15\% (of which 5\% is unconditional) with respect to Business as Usual by 2030, yet its overall CO2 emissions are increasing. Urgent actions are needed for Bangladesh to fulfil its climate pledge. We use a fit-for-purpose Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model to evaluate the effects of several decarbonisation policies, namely the implementation of carbon taxes and the removal of fossil fuel subsidies and intra-sectoral electricity price distortions. We find that all policies can deliver a win-win situation in terms of macroeconomic variables and CO2 emissions with respect to a benchmark scenario that includes existing price distortions and no carbon taxes. The reduction of 4.6\% in CO2 emissions achieved in the price reform policy experiment indicates that liberalised energy markets can help achieve its Paris Agreement target. Thus, we recommend that the government considers reforming electricity and fossil fuel price structure to foster economic development and environmental sustainability.},

Synthesizing paleoclimate, observational, and model-based studies, we provide a revised shortlist of global ``core'' tipping elements and regional ``impact'' tipping elements and their temperature thresholds. Current global warming of \textasciitilde 1.1\textdegree C above preindustrial temperatures already lies within the lower end of some tipping point uncertainty ranges. Several tipping points may be triggered in the Paris Agreement range of 1.5 to {$<$}2\textdegree C global warming, with many more likely at the 2 to 3\textdegree C of warming expected on current policy trajectories. This strengthens the evidence base for urgent action to mitigate climate change and to develop improved tipping point risk assessment, early warning capability, and adaptation strategies.           ,              Getting tipsy                            Climate tipping points are conditions beyond which changes in a part of the climate system become self-perpetuating. These changes may lead to abrupt, irreversible, and dangerous impacts with serious implications for humanity. Armstrong McKay               et al               . present an updated assessment of the most important climate tipping elements and their potential tipping points, including their temperature thresholds, time scales, and impacts. Their analysis indicates that even global warming of 1\textdegree C, a threshold that we already have passed, puts us at risk by triggering some tipping points. This finding provides a compelling reason to limit additional warming as much as possible. \textemdash HJS                        ,              Global warming greater than 1.5\textdegree C could trigger multiple climate tipping points.           ,                             INTRODUCTION                                Climate tipping points (CTPs) are a source of growing scientific, policy, and public concern. They occur when change in large parts of the climate system\textemdash known as tipping elements\textemdash become self-perpetuating beyond a warming threshold. Triggering CTPs leads to significant, policy-relevant impacts, including substantial sea level rise from collapsing ice sheets, dieback of biodiverse biomes such as the Amazon rainforest or warm-water corals, and carbon release from thawing permafrost. Nine policy-relevant tipping elements and their CTPs were originally identified by Lenton                 et al                 . (2008). We carry out the first comprehensive reassessment of all suggested tipping elements, their CTPs, and the timescales and impacts of tipping. We also highlight steps to further improve understanding of CTPs, including an expert elicitation, a model intercomparison project, and early warning systems leveraging deep learning and remotely sensed data.                                                        RATIONALE                                Since the original identification of tipping elements there have been substantial advances in scientific understanding from paleoclimate, observational, and model-based studies. Additional tipping elements have been proposed (e.g., parts of the East Antarctic ice sheet) and the status of others (e.g., Arctic summer sea ice) has been questioned. Observations have revealed that parts of the West Antarctic ice sheet may have already passed a tipping point. Potential early warning signals of the Greenland ice sheet, Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, and Amazon rainforest destabilization have been detected. Multiple abrupt shifts have been found in climate models. Recent work has suggested that up to 15 tipping elements are now active (Lenton                 et al                 ., 2019). Hence it is timely to synthesize this new knowledge to provide a revised shortlist of potential tipping elements and their CTP thresholds.                                                        RESULTS               We identify nine global ``core'' tipping elements which contribute substantially to Earth system functioning and seven regional ``impact'' tipping elements which contribute substantially to human welfare or have great value as unique features of the Earth system (see figure). Their estimated CTP thresholds have significant implications for climate policy: Current global warming of \textasciitilde 1.1\textdegree C above pre-industrial already lies within the lower end of five CTP uncertainty ranges. Six CTPs become likely (with a further four possible) within the Paris Agreement range of 1.5 to {$<$}2\textdegree C warming, including collapse of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, die-off of low-latitude coral reefs, and widespread abrupt permafrost thaw. An additional CTP becomes likely and another three possible at the \textasciitilde 2.6\textdegree C of warming expected under current policies.                                         CONCLUSION               Our assessment provides strong scientific evidence for urgent action to mitigate climate change. We show that even the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to well below 2\textdegree C and preferably 1.5\textdegree C is not safe as 1.5\textdegree C and above risks crossing multiple tipping points. Crossing these CTPs can generate positive feedbacks that increase the likelihood of crossing other CTPs. Currently the world is heading toward \textasciitilde 2 to 3\textdegree C of global warming; at best, if all net-zero pledges and nationally determined contributions are implemented it could reach just below 2\textdegree C. This would lower tipping point risks somewhat but would still be dangerous as it could trigger multiple climate tipping points.

Pins are colored according to our central global warming threshold estimate being below 2\textdegree C, i.e., within the Paris Agreement range (light orange, circles); between 2 and 4\textdegree C, i.e., accessible with current policies (orange, diamonds); and 4\textdegree C and above (red, triangles).},

  abstract = {This paper investigates how institutional pressures affect the development of Circular Economy (CE) in firms. Using Institutional Entrepreneurship as a theoretical framework, this paper considers three different levels of institutional pressures (coercive, normative, and mimetic) to examine the effect of each pressure and their interactions on the development of CE. Seeking to clarify the debate on the effect of institutional pressures, this paper considers that the main limitation arises from the fact that previous research has analysed the relationship between institutional pressures without considering the interaction between them and the non-linearity of the processes. Deviating from previous papers, our analysis combines regression methods with Machine learning (i.e. Artificial Neural Networks), and employs data from the EU survey on Public Consultation on the Circular Economy. This research finds that while coercive pressures have a compulsory effect on the development of CE, mimetic and normative pressures do not have an effect by themselves, but only in interaction with coercive pressures. Moreover, this paper shows that the application of machine learning tools has an important contribution in solving interaction problems. From the perspective of environmental policy, this means that a comprehensive policy is required, which implies the coexistence or interaction of the three types of pressures.}

  abstract = {The renowned cultural theorist and media designer Anne Balsamo maintains that technology and culture are inseparable; those who engage in technological innovation are designing the cultures of the future. Designing Culture is a call for taking culture seriously in the design and development of innovative technologies. Balsamo contends that the wellspring of technological innovation is the technological imagination, a quality of mind that enables people to think with technology, to transform what is known into what is possible. She describes the technological imagination at work in several multimedia collaborations in which she was involved as a designer or developer. One of these entailed the creation of an interactive documentary for the NGO Forum held in conjunction with the UN World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995. (That documentary is included as a DVD in Designing Culture.) Balsamo also recounts the development of the interactive museum exhibit XFR: Experiments in the Future of Reading, created by the group RED (Research in Experimental Documents) at Xerox PARC. She speculates on what it would mean to cultivate imaginations as ingenious in creating new democratic cultural possibilities as they are in creating new kinds of technologies and digital media. Designing Culture is a manifesto for transforming educational programs and developing learning strategies adequate to the task of inspiring culturally attuned technological imaginations.},

Because it is concerned with alternative present and future states, many acknowledge the potential of speculative design for raising critical discussion and public engagement on science, technology, and society. In this article, we ask how the analogy of speculative design to thought experiments highlights or problematizes certain aspects of speculative design. Building on the work of Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby, we answer this question through a comparative conceptual analysis of speculative design and thought experimentation as they are understood in their original contexts. We go on to create a theoretical framework applied to four cases: Metamorphism; Walden, a game; The Substitute; and GoatMan. We argue that understanding speculative design by analogy to thought experiments could help design practitioners better achieve the aim of public engagement, enabling a more inclusive and nuanced discussion about the form and style of speculative design.},

  abstract = {Packaging ecodesign can contribute to improve the environmental performance of pharmaceutical products. The main goal of this article is to present an ecodesign approach based on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for pharmaceutical packaging, assessing opportunities to improve the packaging environmental performance, and providing ecodesign recommendations to the pharmaceutical sector. The proposed ecodesign approach consists of five phases. I) The most representative packaging of medicines in the market (blister, bottle, and sachet), with different sizes, materials and weights, were investigated. II) Three ecodesign strategies were selected to analyze with LCA: i) weight and/or volume reduction, ii) alternative types of packaging, and iii) transportation with less environmental impact. III\textendash IV) A cradle-to-gate life cycle model has been implemented, including transport to pharmacies. Alternative transportation modes (truck, train, airplane, and ship) and different packaging production locations have been considered. Thirteen environmental categories have been analyzed. V) Ecodesign recommendations for improving the environmental performance of pharmaceutical packaging are presented in two stages: i) specific recommendations based on LCA, illustrated in sheets with examples of ecodesign, quantifying the environmental impact reduction of an ecodesign solution compared to the original; and ii) generic recommendations for different packaging life cycle phases. Ecodesign recommendations highlight the use of smaller-size packaging, avoiding superfluous elements and empty spaces, which reduces material and production costs, and transportation impacts; the selection of modes of transportation with less environmental impact, considering the packaging production location; and the use of electric vehicles for pharmacy distribution. This ecodesign approach based on LCA allows quantifying environmental impacts robustly to support the incorporation of environmental information from the design, material selection, and packaging production to distribution till the final consumer. This article emphasizes the importance of developing specific packaging ecodesign based on LCA to improve environmental performance and provide more informed recommendations to stakeholders.},

In various daily contexts, individuals can make small choices in favor of environmentally sustainable behavior to counteract this effect. With ever-increasing digitalization, these decisions are shifted toward a digital world. Digital nudging presents a promising approach to foster environmentally sustainable behavior without restricting the freedom of choice. However, research on digital nudging appears to be highly fragmented, leaving information systems designers without guidance on which nudging elements to choose in a specific context. By conducting a structured literature review followed by a framework development, this paper provides an information systems design perspective that matches digital nudging elements on context decision types and indicates the effectiveness of their combination. Thus, the provided framework is of practical use for designing effective digital nudging elements. Moreover, it contributes to research by identifying meta-inferences of the current status quo and offering impulses for future research.},

Robo-advisors are in use in the developed nations since over a decade but have recently entered the developing nations, like India, since early 2015. This research explores the present state of Robo-advisory services in the Indian context and investigates how Robo-advisors can help in mitigating behavioral biases of a retail investor. The present study gives an in-depth understanding about the ability of Robo-advisory to mitigate behavioral biases from the perspective of experts. These experts are from the product development team, quality control team, middleware, or at top management level from BFSI (Banking and Financial Services Industry), IT (Information Technology), FINTECH (Finance Technology) and NBFCs (Non-Banking Finance Companies) in India. The researchers have adopted a qualitative approach, of interviewing these experts, to discover the phenomenon and gain insight about Robo-advisory services. Each interview was recorded and transcribed on word-for-word basis. The transcribed content underwent a structured content analysis, using different categories, resulting from the conducted literature review. The intent is not to generalize the findings, since the field of Robo-advisory is at a nascent stage as far as Indian market is concerned. The key findings indicate that the current focus is to increase awareness level amongst investors, by educating them and by building trust. Our conclusion emphasizes the fact that Robo-advisors still need to mitigate investor's biases while performing risk analysis and profiling the investors. Robo-advisory platforms are not yet comprehensively self-sufficient to accurately perform risk analysis for retail investors.},

We also highlight two broad and complementary perspectives for defining possible quality criteria for assessing explainability: epistemological and psychological (cognitive). These definition attempts aim to support the three main functions that we believe should attract the interest and further research of XAI scholars: clear inventories, clear verification criteria, and clear validation methods.},

Because of the pandemic of this novel coronavirus in terms of COVID-19, the social life global wide has been changed a lot. To keep the social distance between human being to prevent from being infected is the most important strategy for all the countries. Many dental schools have been locked down to minimize the spread out of this coronavirus infection. Close contact between human being are required for all those learning process in traditional dental education. Learning methods should be innovated to keep on the learning process but away from being infected for dental education during pandemic. The purpose of this manuscript is to exchange the information and experience of those dental educators from different countries to prepare for the future demand for dental education during pandemic. Materials and methods By means of three online symposiums, dental educators from different countries were invited to give presentation and discussion regarding to the information and experience in the innovation of dental education during the pandemic. Results The results showed that the impact of the pandemic of COVID-19 affects the dental education a lot. Intelligent technology has certain benefit for the learning process of dental education during the pandemic. Conclusion The impact of the pandemic of COVID-19 affects dental education a lot. The model of dental education should be innovated to suit different situations and novelty intelligent technology should be applied for future dental education.},

  abstract = {Green transformation has become one of the most important directions in the further development of the world. It involves the development of green technologies and the creation of legal regulations enforcing, for example, saving energy or reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases, as well as any other activities aimed at changing society's attitude towards the acceptance of \textendash{} frequently more expensive but more environment-friendly \textendash{} technological solutions and legal norms. Thus green transformation can be defined as combining economic growth with caring about the environment in order to guarantee a high quality of life for present and future generations at the level which is attainable due to civilisational development, as well as to an effective and rational use of the available resources. Still, there is no single globally accepted way to this transformation. It is proceeding in a variety of ways and depends on many different factors. The main purpose of the paper is a comparative analysis of the directions of changes occurring in the process of green transformation in EU countries. The added value of the research presented in the paper and its novelty is the analysis of the current patterns of green transformation in EU countries. The paper concentrated on recognizing them and drawing attention to the unfavourable directions of this transformation as well as to its positive aspects. The changes in the process of green transformation were analysed based on data used by the OECD to describe green growth in two periods: 2004 or 2005 as initial data and the last available data (usually 2018 or 2019). For this purpose the TOPSIS method was applied. The EU countries were divided into groups according to their way of applying green transformation. The provided research allows to better understand the course of this transformation in various EU countries.},

The air exchange rate in the conference hall was between 5.73 ACH and 9.11 ACH, which exceeded the minimum air ventilation rate required in Taiwan. This shows that a passive solar chimney can effectively applied to the conference hall to meet indoor ventilation and air exchange requirements without using air conditioning.}

We use a data-driven analysis of global high-level climate action on emissions reduction in the building sector using 256,717 English-language tweets across a 13-year time frame (2009\textendash 2021). Using natural language processing and network analysis, we show that public sentiments and emotions on social media are reactive to these climate policy actions. Between 2009\textendash 2012, discussions around green building-led emission reduction efforts were highly influential in shaping the online public perceptions of climate action. From 2013 to 2016, communication around low-carbon construction and energy efficiency significantly influenced the online narrative. More significant interactions on net-zero transition, climate tech, circular economy, mass timber housing and climate justice in 2017\textendash 2021 shaped the online climate action discourse. We find positive sentiments are more prominent and recurrent and comprise a larger share of the social media conversation. However, we also see a rise in negative sentiment by 30\textendash 40\% following popular policy events like the IPCC report launches, the Paris Agreement and the EU Green Deal. With greater online engagement and information diffusion, social and environmental justice topics emerge in the online discourse. Continuing such shifts in online climate discourse is pivotal to a more just and people-centric transition in such hard-to-decarbonise sectors.},

  abstract = {The application of life cycle assessment (LCA) through ecodesign strategies enables making informed choices on the sustainability of products and services. Accordingly, in this work we quantify the environmental impacts associated with the life cycle of an enzymatic multipurpose cleaner to provide guidance on how producers and consumers can boost the implementation of more sustainable production and consumption patterns. LCA methodology with primary data is applied. To enable future comparison, 1 kg of detergent in its container is used as a functional unit, and cradle-to-grave system boundaries are set according to the reference "detergents and cleaning products" Product Category Rules (PCR). The environmental impacts are grouped into upstream, core and downstream life cycle phases, and seven impact categories are analyzed. Regarding the upstream stage, the degreaser 3-butoxy-2-propanol has the larger environmental load in 4 of 7 categories analyzed. During the core stage, electricity, natural gas and road transport of raw materials are the main contributors, while road transport has the largest share in 6 of the 7 downstream impact categories. Considering a cradle-to-grave boundary, a CO2-eq footprint of 0.76 kg per kg of packaged detergent is obtained, where energy consumption and transportation are the main impact drivers. Five ecodesigned scenarios are proposed to lower the overall environmental footprint of the enzymatic cleaner, including the use of renewable energy, higher volume packaging, the use of recycled packaging, the use of renewable surfactants from vegetal origin instead of petrochemically derived ones and the change from road transport for distribution to railway transport are analyzed. Among the proposed new scenarios aimed lower the cradle-to-grave environmental impacts, enlarging packaging volume results the most effective choice, lowering the impacts by 8\textendash 38\% (global warming reduction by 25\%). On the contrary, the substitution of the petroleum-based surfactant by one based on palm kernel oil increases the impacts by 4\textendash 16\%. Overall, using larger packaging and the adoption of railway transportation are the most effective measures to reduce the impacts. As the followed PCR does not take into account the impacts generated after the use phase, we encourage its extension to the complete life cycle so toxicity and biodegradability aspects can also be considered. Covering from the extraction of raw materials, to production, transport, use and end-of-life, this work may pave the path toward the adoption of responsible production and consumption patterns in the cleaning sector.},

ALA architects delivered the winning entry to the architectural competition held in 2013. In 2014 Ramboll Finland won the structural design contract for the project, taking the project from conceptual architectural design through to completion of construction in 2018. The main structural system is fundamentally a steel frame solution designed to Eurocode. Two EXC4 classified, 109m span, tilted arches carry the two main floors and roof of the building. Post-tensioned cables tie the bases of the arches to provide a tied-arch structure. Other post-tensioned cables in the floor system and concrete cores hold the tilting arches in position. Transverse trusses allow the cantilevering balcony to be delivered. 2400t of steel have been used to deliver the main frame structural solution. With careful and considered design, fabrication and construction, high quality to good tolerances and stringent requirements have been successfully achieved. An overview of the bridge-like structural system that has been conceived and developed for the project shall be presented. Some of the challenges encountered and resolved in the design shall be discussed, as well as an overview of key decisions made to handle project delivery budget and timetable requirements.},

Only material production and use phase are considered in this work, to have a better understanding of the different contributions. Simultaneous topological design and material choice are investigated for 2D examples. The results show that considering out-of-plane thickness as a variable, both problems can now be decoupled for simple load cases. It is shown that a very simple material index depending only on the type of transport can be used. An optimal volume fraction is obtained, specific only to each topology problem, but unrelated to the material chosen or the loads applied. The method is promising for fast ecodesign and its simple implementation enables easy future improvements.},

  abstract = {Food waste is an inefficiency problem that needs to be reduced significantly to achieve a sustainable food system. Best practices and knowledge are available on how to reduce waste but large volumes of food are still wasted every year, so policies that support or enforce broader implementation of best practices are needed. One policy that could be used to push implementation and successful use of best practices to reduce food waste is the Swedish Environmental Code, which states that all actors must consider every possibility to reduce the amount of waste generated in any facility, unless this is unreasonably expensive. However, there is no clear definition on the actual waste reduction needed to comply with this requirement, so it is not enforced in practice. This study explored the potential gains of applying the Environmental Code, potential benchmarking thresholds for illegal levels of food waste and best voluntary practices that can achieve low levels of food waste. The Environmental Code is applicable to most operator food handling systems, and was assessed here using the Swedish public catering sector as a case. All 290 Swedish municipalities were asked to provide raw data for the study and some agreed, resulting in a dataset covering 458 public catering units serving care homes, schools and preschools. The data were analysed to identify different permissible levels of food waste, while the best canteens provided information on their best practices to keep food waste low. The results showed that with best voluntary practice for each type of catering unit, overall food waste would be reduced by up to 76 \%. Best voluntary practices used by the best-performing canteens were identified as: `reusing buffet leftovers', `adjusting recipes based on previous consumption', `advising guests to start with small tasting portions', `setting goals for waste reduction' and `serving smaller volumes in buffet containers and refilling more often'. All these actions can realistically be implemented as standard practices by public catering organisations. The present analysis could not confirm that all these actions have actually been implemented, or to what extent, but practical implementation of identified best voluntary practices meeting stated benchmarks is recommended. The Environmental Code is technology-neutral and goal-oriented and participating food business operators are not forced by law or official regulations to introduce resource-saving measures, but this study shows that some measures can lead to a large reduction in food waste. The study does not show whether harsh, i.e. costly, measures can be enforced on businesses, which can only be determined by case law (court practice). However, in the specific cases in this study, measures that could have been enforced based on the Environmental Code would have led to at least 76 \% reduction in food waste. This would be a major step towards a sustainable food system.},

  abstract = {Plastic pollution and climate change have commonly been treated as two separate issues and sometimes are even seen as competing. Here we present an alternative view that these two issues are fundamentally linked. Primarily, we explore how plastic contributes to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the beginning to the end of its life cycle. Secondly, we show that more extreme weather and floods associated with climate change, will exacerbate the spread of plastic in the natural environment. Finally, both issues occur throughout the marine environment, and we show that ecosystems and species can be particularly vulnerable to both, such as coral reefs that face disease spread through plastic pollution and climate-driven increased global bleaching events. A Web of Science search showed climate change and plastic pollution studies in the ocean are often siloed, with only 0.4\% of the articles examining both stressors simultaneously. We also identified a lack of regional and industry-specific life cycle analysis data for comparisons in relative GHG contributions by materials and products. Overall, we suggest that rather than debate over the relative importance of climate change or marine plastic pollution, a more productive course would be to determine the linking factors between the two and identify solutions to combat both crises.},

  abstract = {Speculative Design is an approach that considers alternate futures for technology and society. Through prototyping and/or defining scenarios, important discussions about ethics or the impact of design on the environment and culture can be brought to the forefront of the design process. Sometimes considered alarmist and sensational, it's still a powerful tool for design.  Companies are applying this approach to business strategies or articulating visions for emerging technologies. They are speculating on everything from the future of their products to eliciting communities for input to developing new services. Speculative Design's potential for application is so diverse that it can be used as a lens to consider a more holistic approach to problems and uncover new questions about the future that we may have never asked.  Phil shares several projects from Apple's early vision of the iPad to how governments are using it to design new services today. He also covers some basic framework for how to begin looking at the future and consider all the potential factors and environments that could influence your products or services.

To this end, participants were presented with three different products (smart phones, monitors and portable speakers) with two different nudges (attraction and default) and a control condition. Results from two experiments show that, while there was already a strong preference to make eco-friendly choices in control conditions, when eco-friendly choices were costlier, there was a clear positive effect of an attraction nudge on participants' eco-friendly preferences. In other words, when product prices were generally high, or when there are large price differences between options, the attraction nudge resulted in a higher probability of eco-friendly choices compared to when no attraction effect is used. The default nudge was less efficient, sometimes producing a negative effect, while its effect was mediated by whether participants endorsed a strong bio-centric worldview, in which case the default nudge promoted more eco-friendly choices. The results are discussed in relation to potential challenges pertaining to deceit and perceived paternalistic intentions with use of nudges.},

Generated using a moderated focus group discussion with principals and teachers, the findings suggest that principals' and teachers' leadership practices are acceptable in the policy, social support, and financial dimensions but still lack structural and teaching aspects about conducting blended learning. Based on this study's findings, pesantren leaders (kyai) and school principals should pay attention to training programs for implementing blended learning for teachers. The government is encouraged to assist in providing technical facilities pesantren can implement blended learning more effectively.},

We use the secondary reflection of light to reduce glare and improve lighting uniformity. The results show that high efficiency lighting can reduce by 25\% the standard lighting equipment and still provide the same illumination levels. Furthermore, the overall conference hall lighting uniformity increases from 0.59 to 0.78.}

The bulk of the literature on environmental corporate social responsibility suggests that this type of behavior even results in higher profit. However, a product-differentiation framework with perfect competition predicts that renewable energy use has no effect on profit. This paper tests this prediction by investigating the relationship between firms' renewable energy use and profit on the basis of panel data for 920 firms over 2014\textendash 2018. We do not find evidence for an impact of renewable energy use on profit. Hence, a `win-win' in the form of higher profit and a better environment does not seem to exist. In addition, the results appear to suggest that firms do not have a positive willingness to pay for renewable energy as contribution to the environment. This implies that firms are only willing to contribute to climate-change mitigation through buying renewable energy when this is aligned with the profit-maximization objective.},

The COVID-19 pandemic has suddenly and abruptly forced schools and education indeed to engage in such a transformation. In this study we examine the digital transformation initiated by the COVID-19 pandemic in the basic education of the young generation, the variety of digital divides emerging and reinforced, and the possible barriers reported along the way. We argue that information management research should better acknowledge children, their digitalized everyday life and their basic education as significant areas of concern. We should understand them as well as allow them to shape the education we offer in the context of higher education, but we should also aim at influencing the basic education of the young generation \textendash{} for the purpose of equipping them with important skills and competencies for their digital futures but also for the purpose of arousing their interest in this important field, maybe even as a career option.},

  abstract = {When designing a new circular economy system, many aspects must be considered in order to benefit from all possible environmental improvements. The selection of the right market or use of the resulting product is of paramount importance to ensure the final implementation of the solution. With this purpose, this study has undertaken the selection of a market that could absorb the large amounts of by-products generated in breweries, the optimization of the logistics for the collection of by-products, and the ecodesign of a valorisation process and the facility needed to set up the entire value chain. This analysis has resulted in the ecodesign of a valorisation process of brewery's side streams aiming at the production of ingredients for the formulation of aquaculture feeds. Life Cycle Assessment has been used to find an efficient and sustainable processing scheme and to ecodesign a Model Recovery Plant that uses the brewery's by-product as second-generation feedstuff to produce ingredients for aquafeed. The overall ecodesign of the new circular economy scheme for Brewer's side streams reached a reduction of the environmental footprint of 6\% in the resulting aquafeed products that account for the biggest part of the aquaculture footprint.},

In an attempt to understand and propose solutions to this challenge, the authors of this paper set out to: test an innovative combination of methods to generate and evaluate ideas and strategies; and to write about the findings using collaborative online methods. During this process universities in the UK moved to online working and so the authors completed this paper through entirely online means. The authors - a team of academic researchers from the University of AAA - came together in sessions designed as a hybrid of World Caf\'e and Delphi technique approaches to discuss challenges and solutions. The findings were written up drawing on insights from the use of massively authored papers (also known as `massively open online papers', MOOPs), and online tools to enable remote collaboration. Expert consensus was sought in this project within a group of participants (N~\hspace{0pt}=~\hspace{0pt}7) in one university setting to create a MOOP. This paper presents details of the process, the findings, and reflections on this collaborative and cooperative exercise. That this paper was written using the methods discussed within it, highlights the value and success of the approach. In light of the current Coronavirus pandemic and the increased need to work remotely, this paper offers academics useful strategies for meaningful and productive online collaboration.},

The review focuses on two main areas of research \textendash{} the effects of geometry and inclination angle on the ventilation performance of a solar chimney. The experimental investigations of solar chimney have dominated the existing literature. However, numerical modelling of solar chimney using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique has attracted increasing attention. Moreover, this review found that solar chimney as a passive ventilation strategy has not been fully understood.}

Though Indian teachers are used to the chalk-and-talk method, an online setup has compelled them to discover innovative strategies to maintain an inclusive classroom. It was found that teachers are using puppetry, storytelling, energizers, ice-breakers in their sessions to make it engaging. An in-depth study was undertaken to understand the experiences of five primary class teachers from private schools in India. Data thus collected were analyzed qualitatively. The study results demonstrated that the teachers had improved professionally\textemdash{} they have become independent in using the internet and exploring new ways of teaching them per their needs. Nevertheless, it was also found that the schools lack support, fear among the teachers of being asked to quit the job, blocking students from the online class if they fail to pay the fees, and exorbitant salary cuts. The challenges related to young students were - lack of proper resources for online sessions, low attention span, technical distractions, lack of physical development, excessive interference of the parents and lack of socialization.

The concept of the `duality of structure' is taken as our starting point for understanding the linkages between health promotion and sustainable development, and for uncovering the structural properties or conditions which either enable or constrain sustainable public health initiatives. We argue that strategies towards health promotion are not sufficiently integrated with strategies for sustainable development, and thus political strategies aimed at solving health problems or sustainability problems may cause new, undesired and unforeseen environmental or health problems. First, we explore how the relation between health and sustainability is articulated in international policy documents. Next, we develop a model for understanding the relation between health promotion and sustainability. Third, we use examples from agriculture and food production to illustrate that health and sustainability are mutually enabling and constraining. We conclude that while the renewed focus on food security and food inequalities has brought the health and sustainability dimensions of the food system onto the political agenda, the conceptualization of duality between health and sustainability could be a new platform for a critical and theoretical stance towards the market-oriented food system strategy. Thinking along the lines of duality means that the integration of health promotion strategies and sustainable development strategies cannot be based on an approach to integration in which either health or sustainability is given precedence over the other. From a duality perspective, integration means conceiving sustainability from a health perspective and health from a sustainability perspective.}

  abstract = {This study aims to provide information about circular economy perspectives in the management of textile products and textile waste in the European Union (EU). The report improves the understanding of current value chains in the manufacturing and retailing of apparel products in the EU and provides a detailed picture of material flows in the EU textile sector in a global context. This includes an overview of the size of the textile processing industry in the EU in terms of turnover, employment, number and size of companies, and the EU's share of the global industry. Then, an accurate picture is drawn of the volume (tonnes) and value (Euros) of new fibres, yarns, fabrics and textile products (apparel and household textiles) produced in the EU and traded with the rest of the world. This is complemented by a detailed look at the volumes of post consumer textiles available for collection, reuse and recycling in EU countries, based on available data. This mapping serves as a preview of the upcoming challenges associated with the increased collection and processing of post-consumer textiles, foreseen as a result of mandatory obligations for the separate collection of textile waste in 2025. Furthermore, it identifies needs for planning the new fibre-to-fibre recycling capacity. This study also provides information on current industrial practice in the EU for the collection, sorting and preparation of post-consumer textiles for reuse and recycling. Both currently installed and emerging technologies for the recycling of textile fabrics and apparel are mapped in order to provide a snapshot of the state of the art of available technologies that are expected to cope with the increased amount of textile waste towards 2025. The study details existing capacities for the collection and sorting of old textiles in Europe, and describes recycling technologies that are at a relatively high technological maturity level in order to estimate future sorting and recycling capacities. In order to minimise overlaps with an ongoing study commissioned by DG GROW about textile recycling technologies, the review of recycling technologies in this study mainly focuses on the core principles of each technology type and provides examples of that technology type in operation. On this basis, the challenges that exist with regard to the sorting and recycling technologies in terms of achieving a more circular economy will be addressed. With regard to the perspectives of the circular economy in the textile sector, the study collects and examines established and newly emerging circular business models that have the potential to make the value chain for the European textile and clothing market and the post-consumer textiles sector more circular. Knowledge on existing and emerging practices of repair, reuse and recycling of textile products is presented and analysed with a view to ascertaining how these activities can contribute to increasing the circular economy in the EU. This provides a basis for identifying which options show the greatest potential, and for understanding which policy interventions, if any, could help shift the textile sector towards increased circularity. The study concludes with an analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) of the textiles production and consumption system in two scenarios: 1) the prevalence of a linear economy model and 2) a projected circular economy scenario. On this basis, the opportunities for and threats to the current textile sector, including the post-consumer textile collection, sorting, reuse and recycling industries, are examined in their entirety. Existing and emerging circular economy models are analysed in the same way},

However, we know quite little about whether such action can also generate benefits for firms induced by political action, such as benefits associated with public procurement, (softer) regulatory enforcement and corporate tax breaks. We argue that citizens are more likely to support such rewards for firms that have a stronger record of environmental business conduct, express stronger commitment to future environmental action and submit such action to independent audits. The empirical analysis focuses on vehicle emissions reduction by car producers and plastic waste reduction by retailers. Choice experiments with 6726 respondents from Germany and the United States support these arguments. Our findings are surprisingly consistent across two different sociocultural and political contexts (Germany, USA), two different environmental policy domains (vehicle emissions, plastic waste) and three forms of political rewards. Whereas studies focusing on narrowly defined economic benefits (competitiveness) of environmental business conduct have become somewhat more sceptical about the magnitude and scope of such benefits, our results provide more room for optimism by pointing to other types of benefits of corporate environmental action.},

  abstract = {We perform a choice experiment modeled on equity fund savings, to estimate preferences for sustainable and responsible investments and conventional fund attributes among private investors in Sweden (n = 559). We find that sustainability strategies, as well as an environmental focus, were more important than other fund characteristics. Moreover, negative affect in relation to SRI contributed as an observable factor to explain variance heterogeneity while experience in fund savings, positive product involvement as well as positive affect were not significant. Our main finding is, however, that latent behavioral characteristics of the investors are strong predictors of latent class membership thereby contributing to distinguish nontrivial investor sub-groups. We find no support for the contribution of sociodemographic characteristics. These results can serve to identify market segments so that equity fund offerings, including those related to SRI, can be mobilized, optimized and tailored to meet the demand for SRI among private investors.},

  abstract = {The shift to distance teaching and learning during the COVID-19 pandemic brought about a real challenge for both instructors and students. To face these difficulties in teaching undergraduate Chemistry courses at the University of Santo Tomas, a blended learning strategy in the context of teaching and learning of Physical Chemistry 1 and Analytical Chemistry for Chemical Engineering students were employed. Here, we present an online strategy that facilitated the transition from traditional face-to-face learning to full online instruction. This is a five-component blended learning strategy referred to as Discover, Learn, Practice, Collaborate and Assess (DLPCA). In DLPCA, the asynchronous part of the teaching was achieved through broadcast of pre-recorded lecture videos on YouTube to allow students to study and progress with learning at their own pace. The synchronous part of the teaching was conducted using video conferencing platforms, such as Zoom or Google Meet. The DLPCA strategy was presented and discussed to the students prior to its implementation. The analysis of the teaching and learning experience based on three indicators (i) student's learning experience, (ii) student's academic performance and (iii) instructor observations showed that DLPCA had a positive impact on students and instructors. The identified challenges were stability of internet connection and instructor's familiarity with readily available internet-based teaching tools, such as video conferencing software. Instructors must also find means to improve their interaction with students and maintain student interest and engagement during online classes. The survey also indicated that most of the students are satisfied with the DLCPA strategy. Hence, this strategy is considered a manageable and effective alternative that can be adapted to full online instruction to other undergraduate Chemistry lecture courses. Overall, the findings and insights in this study will add valuable resources for further hybrid instruction in the post-COVID-19 time in higher education.},

Here we address this gap using a comprehensive dataset describing the supply of 16 cultural, regulating and provisioning ecosystem services in 150 European agricultural grassland plots, and detailed multi-scale data on land use and plant diversity. After controlling for land-use and abiotic factors, we show that both plot-level and surrounding plant diversity play an important role in the supply of cultural and aboveground regulating ecosystem services. In contrast, provisioning and belowground regulating ecosystem services are more strongly driven by field-level management and abiotic factors. Structural equation models revealed that surrounding plant diversity promotes ecosystem services both directly, probably by fostering the spill-over of ecosystem service providers from surrounding areas, and indirectly, by maintaining plot-level diversity. By influencing the ecosystem services that local stakeholders prioritized, biodiversity at different scales was also shown to positively influence a wide range of stakeholder groups. These results provide a comprehensive picture of which ecosystem services rely most strongly on biodiversity, and the respective scales of biodiversity that drive these services. This key information is required for the upscaling of biodiversity\textendash ecosystem service relationships, and the informed management of biodiversity within agricultural landscapes.}

Using daily data from November 2018 to June 2020, we use both DY (Diebold \& Yilmaz, 2012) and BK (Barun\'ik et~al., 2017) to examine the volatility connectedness of returns series. The results of DY suggest that, first, the total connectedness of 21st century technology assets and traditional common stocks is very high, and hence in the turbulent economy, there is a high probability of contemporaneous losses. Second, Bitcoin, MSCIW, MSCI US, and KFTX are net contributors of volatility shocks whereas US dollar, oil, gold, VIX, green bond and green bond select are net receivers. Therefore, Fintech and common equities are not good hedging instruments in the same portfolio. Third, the short-term witnesses higher volatility transmission than the long-term. That is, holding assets for a long-term is likely to mitigate risks whereas trading financial assets in the short-term can increase risk because of higher volatility. Fourth, the traditional assets, gold and oil, as well as modern assets, green bonds, are useful as good hedgers compared with other assets because shock transmissions from them to Fintech, KFTX are below 0.1\% and, more importantly, the total volatility spill-over of all assets in the sample is moderately average, accounting for 44.39\%.},

We used factorial surveys with a 2x2 mixed design to compare user perceptions when a guideline is applied versus violated, under conditions of optimal versus sub-optimal AI performance. The results provided both qualitative and quantitative insights into the UX impact of each guideline. These insights can support creators of user-facing AI systems in their nuanced prioritization and application of the guidelines.}

  abstract = {Language models (LMs) are becoming the foundation for almost all major language technologies, but their capabilities, limitations, and risks are not well understood. We present Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) to improve the transparency of language models. First, we taxonomize the vast space of potential scenarios (i.e. use cases) and metrics (i.e. desiderata) that are of interest for LMs. Then we select a broad subset based on coverage and feasibility, noting what's missing or underrepresented (e.g. question answering for neglected English dialects, metrics for trustworthiness). Second, we adopt a multi-metric approach: We measure 7 metrics (accuracy, calibration, robustness, fairness, bias, toxicity, and efficiency) for each of 16 core scenarios when possible (87.5\% of the time). This ensures metrics beyond accuracy don't fall to the wayside, and that trade-offs are clearly exposed. We also perform 7 targeted evaluations, based on 26 targeted scenarios, to analyze specific aspects (e.g. reasoning, disinformation). Third, we conduct a large-scale evaluation of 30 prominent language models (spanning open, limited-access, and closed models) on all 42 scenarios, 21 of which were not previously used in mainstream LM evaluation. Prior to HELM, models on average were evaluated on just 17.9\% of the core HELM scenarios, with some prominent models not sharing a single scenario in common. We improve this to 96.0\%: now all 30 models have been densely benchmarked on the same core scenarios and metrics under standardized conditions. Our evaluation surfaces 25 top-level findings. For full transparency, we release all raw model prompts and completions publicly for further analysis, as well as a general modular toolkit. We intend for HELM to be a living benchmark for the community, continuously updated with new scenarios, metrics, and models.},

  abstract = {Financial advisors seek to accurately measure individuals' risk preferences and provide sound personalized investment advice. Both advice tasks are increasingly offered through automated online technologies. Little is known, however, about what drives individuals' acceptance of such automated financial advice and, from a consumer point of view, which firms may be best positioned to provide such advice. We generate novel insights on these questions by conducting a real-world empirical study using an interactive automated online tool that employs an innovative computer algorithm to build pension investment profiles, the ``Pension Builder,'' and a large, representative sample. We focus on the role that two key firm characteristics have on consumer acceptance of pension investment advice generated by computer algorithms running on automated interactive online tools: profit orientation and role in the sales channel. We find that consumers' perceptions of trust and expertise of the firm providing the automated advice are important drivers of advice acceptance (besides a strong impact of the satisfaction with the consumer\textendash online tool interaction), and that these constructs themselves are clearly influenced by the for-profit vs. not-for-profit orientation and the product provider vs. advisor only role in the sales channel of the firm providing the advice. We discuss the implications of our findings for marketers and policy makers and provide suggestions for future research.},

  abstract = {To support the sustainable development of the primary sector, in line with green new deals emerging worldwide, eco-design of new agri-food products is a priority. The wine industry, due to its growing market, has matured the need to develop an approach for understanding the environmental impacts of its products and to develop strategies to reduce such impacts in a life cycle perspective. This study has a two-fold aim: presenting the development of a methodological proposal for the use of PEF and PEF-CR in the eco-design of wine products; testing its applicability in a case study in the wine sector. The methodological proposal considered the combination of ISO 14006 and PEF methods into a procedure consisting of 8 steps. The proposal was successfully applied in the case of an Italian vinery committed to develop a new red wine product with improved performance if compared to its standard red wine production. The study occurred between 2018 and 2020, collecting primary data related to vineyards and vinery operations. Results proved that PEF method and PEF-CR can be effectively used in the eco-design of new wine products with reduced environmental impacts. Moreover, the study confirmed that PEF method can be used within the framework of ISO 14006. The study on standard red wine production confirmed that the fuel and pesticide consumption in the vineyard operation are environmental hotspots. To reduce these impacts, a new selection of Merlot Khorus grapes was made by the Italian vinery. Results of the eco-designed proved that the new product scored a reduction in the potential environmental impacts.},

It looks forward to an intellectually enriched opportunity for further future academic decision-making during any adversity. The intended purpose of this paper seeks to address the required essentialities of online teaching-learning in education amid the COVID-19 pandemic and how can existing resources of educational institutions effectively transform formal education into online education with the help of virtual classes and other pivotal online tools in this continually shifting educational landscape. The paper employs both quantitative and qualitative approach to study the perceptions of teachers and students on online teaching-learning modes and also highlighted the implementation process of online teaching-learning modes. The value of this paper is to draw a holistic picture of ongoing online teaching-learning activities during the lockdown period including establishing the linkage between change management process and online teaching-learning process in education system amid the COVID-19 outbreak so as to overcome the persisting academic disturbance and consequently ensure the resumption of educational activities and discourses as a normal course of procedure in the education system.},

LCS, which executes discrete event simulations, can evaluate the circularity of the entire life cycle of products. A what-if analysis is undertaken by varying the parameters, including the maximum remanufacturing count, number of remanufacturing sites, collection rate, and compatibility between new and old generations of photocopiers. This study determines that the compatibility of new and old copier models is critically important for increasing circularity and reducing CO2 emissions and life cycle costs. CO2 emissions and life cycle costs are reduced to 42\% and 87\%, respectively, comparing to the situation where the bottles are not remanufactured at all. However, some difficulties in obtaining the required data from the manufacturer made it difficult to evaluate circularity.},

The main goal of our study was to compare different forms of embodiment of Voice User Interfaces (VUI) in terms of how much they distract a user from a cognitive task. We used a voice-only system without physical embodiment (voice-only), a physical embodied system without anthropomorphic features (physical embodied), and a social embodied VUI with social cues such as eye movements (social embodied). In addition, we explored the relationship between design features of the VUI and perceived distraction, social presence, and perceived calm. Twenty-four participants carried out four different cognitive tasks with the three different VUI and one round of cognitive tasks without any VUI present. The cognitive tasks were chosen from a serious game (BrainTagger Suit) and included measurements of cognitive speed, working memory, visual memory, and process inhibition. Overall, results indicated the voice-only VUI caused the least distraction, especially for cognitive speed, while slightly showing impairment for visual memory. Social embodied VUI appeared to cause the most distraction across the four cognitive tasks with physical embodied VUI falling in between. Surprisingly, social presence was perceived as highest for the voice-only system which at the same time received the lowest scores for perceived calm. The advantages and disadvantages of each VUI are discussed.},

Through an integrative literature review, 288 articles were threefold analyzed: (i) bibliometric, (ii) conceptually about ecodesign methods, and (iii) categorically. The results showed a lack of understanding about the ecodesign concepts, and an integrated methodology was proposed. The most inclusive and sustainable ecodesign method for buildings deconstruction was Design for Adaptability and Disassembly (DfAD). The review shows the concentration of the studies in three categories and a framework was created relating DfAD strategies. The sector needs more information on ecodesign methods, deconstruction strategies, reusing of materials, and in the life cycle tools as decision support to make sustainable buildings.},

  abstract = {One of the goals of the European Union (EU) is to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. To this end, internal combustion vehicles (ICVs) will be progressively replaced with battery electric vehicles (BEVs) over the course of a transition period that is expected to last until 2035. While GHG reductions have been extensively evaluated for continental territories, this is not the case for territories with isolated electrical power systems, as in some islands of the EU. Emissions generated in these territories are considerably higher than in continental systems because their electricity generation mixes commonly have more polluting fuels. In this study, a calculation is performed of the CO2 emissions that result from the charging of a reference BEV in the different isolated electrical power systems of the Canary Islands (Spain). The results are then compared with the CO2 emissions of ICVs. Results show that the Canary electrical power systems that consume the least energy are the most contaminating and that charging a BEV entails higher CO2 emissions than those generated by an ICV. In addition, no significant differences were observed between BEV- and ICV-related CO2 emissions in the electrical power systems of the islands with higher energy consumption. A small decrease in CO2 emissions was only observed in isolated insular systems with energy storage systems and high levels of renewable penetration.}

However, controlled laboratory and crowdsourcing settings often introduce issues of artificiality, data contamination, and low managerial relevance of the dependent variables. Field experiments can overcome these issues but are traditionally time- and resource-consuming. This primer presents an alternative experimental setting to conduct online field experiments in a time- and cost-effective way. It does so by introducing the Facebook A/B split test functionality, which allows for random assignment of manipulated variables embedded in ecologically-valid stimuli. We compare and contrast this method against laboratory settings and Amazon Mechanical Turk in terms of design flexibility, managerial relevance, data quality control, and sample representativeness. We then provide an empirical demonstration of how to set up, pre-test, run, and analyze FBST experiments.},

The novel entities boundary in the planetary boundaries framework refers to entities that are novel in a geological sense and that could have large-scale impacts that threaten the integrity of Earth system processes. We review the scientific literature relevant to quantifying the boundary for novel entities and highlight plastic pollution as a particular aspect of high concern. An impact pathway from production of novel entities to impacts on Earth system processes is presented. We define and apply three criteria for assessment of the suitability of control variables for the boundary: feasibility, relevance, and comprehensiveness. We propose several complementary control variables to capture the complexity of this boundary, while acknowledging major data limitations. We conclude that humanity is currently operating outside the planetary boundary based on the weight-of-evidence for several of these control variables. The increasing rate of production and releases of larger volumes and higher numbers of novel entities with diverse risk potentials exceed societies' ability to conduct safety related assessments and monitoring. We recommend taking urgent action to reduce the harm associated with exceeding the boundary by reducing the production and releases of novel entities, noting that even so, the persistence of many novel entities and/or their associated effects will continue to pose a threat.},

Few studies have analysed the influence of social networks on the bond market, and even fewer have specifically analysed the influence on the green bond market. By financing environmental projects that promote sustainability, green bonds are becoming increasingly important because of their relationship with major issues, such as climate change and water management. In addition, increases in people's environmental awareness have led companies to enact corporate social responsibility policies and environmentally sustainable projects. This context supports the relevance of this research because although there have been previous studies on green bonds, there is a scarcity of manuscripts that relate green bonds with social media and, more specifically, with investors' sentiments. Therefore, using panel data analysis, the aim of this study is to analyze how the investor sentiment extracted from social networks influences the green bond market. The results of this manuscript should lead investors and markets to consider social networks as relevant sources of information not only for the equity market but also for the bond market, specifically the green bond market.},

We present results and analysis on home compostable packaging. This type of packaging requires the citizen to be able to correctly identify the packaging as ``home compostable,'' to have composting facilities at home, and to successfully compost the plastic. Using a citizen science approach, we engaged with 9,701 UK citizens geographically spread across the UK to examine their capability, opportunity, and motivation to do this. Of this cohort 1,648 citizens performed home compost experiments to test the environmental performance of compostable plastics. We report on the type of plastics they tested and their disintegration under real home composting conditions. The results show that the public are confused about the meaning of the labels of compostable and biodegradable plastics. 14\% of sampled plastic packaging items tested were certified ``industrial compostable'' only and 46\% had no compostable certification. Of the biodegradable and compostable plastics tested under different home composting conditions, the majority did not fully disintegrate, including 60\% of those that were certified ``home compostable.'' We conclude that for both of these reasons, home composting is not an effective or environmentally beneficial waste processing method for biodegradable or compostable packaging in the UK.},

The findings revealed that LIS students were not fully personalized and successful in decisions about their online educational activities during COVID-19 pandemic. However, they were motivated to learn through online learning and felt confident in performing basic functions of computers and internet. A significant difference of opinion was observed on `computer/internet self-efficacy' and `online communication self-efficacy' based on respondents' gender. Similarly, students from different levels of degree programs reported significantly different computer, internet, and online communication self-efficacy and learning motivation. Moreover, the age and grades of respondents were noted to be strong predictors of their OLR.

This work was carried out in Indonesia, but the benefits are beyond a stateboundary. The study examines how university students in developing countries have faced obstacles, and yet despite this, they are still trying their hardest to stay focused on achieving their personal goals during the pandemic. This research employed a qualitative phenomenological approach, involving eighty students that were studying at the Faculty of Education at a state university in Jakarta, Indonesia. As data collection techniques, students were asked to write learning log diaries and reflective essays and to participate in an online focus group discussion. The results showed that the students' motivation to remain learning during the COVID-19 pandemic fell into three key themes, each with associated sub-themes. The three themes and sub-themes described were: (a) personal, with sub-themes of challenge, curiosity, self-determination, satisfaction and religious commitment; (b) social, with sub-themes of relationships, inspiration, and well-being of self and others; and (c) environmental, with sub-themes of facilities and conditioning. The themes and sub-themes indicate the source of motivation for these university students to learn during the pandemic. This study concluded that these emerging adults were both intrinsically and extrinsically autonomously motivated and committed to their studies. Most of these students were motivated by their consequential aspirations, not by a controlled motivation, nor were they motivated by a reward, a penalty, or a rule that propelled them. By defining how the students managed to empower themselves, this study recommends the importance of preparing students to be more resilient and to enable them to cultivate the ability to remain optimistic and motivated to succeed and overcome any of life's adversities.},

This study is aimed to apprehend the enabling and impeding factors of these reforms, with a focus on optometry education. It brings together how the Indian optometry educational system has responded to COVID-19 disruptions with findings of the 2020 survey, in light of similar survey done in 2018. Methodology A cross-sectional survey was designed to find changes in optometry training and adaptations of Indian optometry educators amid COVID 19 lockdown. In the last week of April 2020, on the observation that the majority of optometry institutions have switched their teaching-learning activities on e-learning mode, an online survey was conducted using a validated questionnaire containing a mix of open and close-ended questions. Results Seventy-three out of 78 optometry educators (93.58\%) have switched to e-learning mode in a very short time span with good confidence. Most teaching-learning and assessment activities are carried out using multi-device supporting video conferencing tools, dedicated educational portals and social media apps. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic is proving to be a constructive disruptor, giving an opportunity for restructuring the present conventional, classroom based educational system. The quick transitions to online mode assisted in keeping continuity of optometry education programs, effectively fitting in the purpose of completion of the current academic year. The rapid transition to online education has not only benefited optometry students but also has created a momentum of continued education for practicing optometrist in the country.

En la \'ultima semana de abril de 2020, a partir de la observaci\'on de que la mayor\'ia de las instituciones de optometr\'ia han cambiado sus actividades de ense\~nanza-aprendizaje en el modo de aprendizaje electr\'onico, se realiz\'o una encuesta en l\'inea utilizando un cuestionario validado que conten\'ia una mezcla de preguntas abiertas y cerradas. Resultados: Setenta y tres de 78 educadores de optometr\'ia (93,58\%) han cambiado a la modalidad de aprendizaje electr\'onico en un per\'iodo de tiempo muy corto con buena confianza. La mayor\'ia de las actividades de ense\~nanza-aprendizaje y evaluaci\'on se llevan a cabo utilizando herramientas de videoconferencia de apoyo multidispositivo, portales educativos dedicados y aplicaciones de redes sociales. Conclusi\'on: La pandemia del COVID-19 est\'a demostrando ser un disruptor constructivo, que ofrece la oportunidad de reestructurar el actual sistema educativo convencional basado en el aula. Las r\'apidas transiciones al modo online ayudaron a mantener la continuidad de los programas educativos de optometr\'ia, encajando eficazmente en el prop\'osito de completar el a\~no acad\'emico actual. La r\'apida transici\'on a la educaci\'on en l\'inea no s\'olo ha beneficiado a los estudiantes de optometr\'ia, sino que tambi\'en ha creado un impulso de educaci\'on continua para los optometristas en ejercicio en el pa\'is.},

  abstract = {In an analysis of food system sustainability challenges and solutions among Swedish food system actors using Q-methodology, five perspectives were identified. One of the main three perspectives placed the highest priority on reduced meat consumption, food waste, and climate impact in agriculture, but downplayed strategies highlighted in the national food strategy and social aspects, and can be interpreted as a diagnostic climate mitigation-oriented perspective that does not reflect current negotiated policy processes or `softer' values of food. In an alternative regenerative perspective, industrialized large-scale farming and lack of internalization of external costs were regarded as the main problems, and diversity, soil health, and organic farming as the main solutions. Proponents of a third perspective regarded phasing out fossil fuels, increased profitability of companies, increased meat production, and self-sufficiency as high priorities. These contrasting views can be a major barrier to transforming the Swedish food system. However, a number of entry points for change (i.e. aspects highly important for some and neutral for others) were identified, including focusing on healthy diets and increased production of fruit and vegetables. Focusing on these can build trust among stakeholders before moving to discussions about the larger and more sensitive systemic changes needed.},

Decisions at the design stage have a significant impact on the downstream activities, easing or making them difficult, although these take place at a very later time. The paper presents an approach to include in the traditional design process environmental sustainability aspects next to functional and economic drivers. Its novelty stands in the support for companies to structure the acquired knowledge about sustainability; recently a growing number of industrial companies faced the environmental question, and now the problem is not related to the absence of environmental data, but to its effective capitalization and related scarce strategies to support and improve it. The method, starting from the company's data and information, identifies the best strategies to simplify and effectively support the decision-making process. In this way, it not only allows the designers to take advantage of the information coming from product life cycle phases but also it makes possible to lower the environmental impact of a product through their decisions. The output of the method consists of charts, maps, and graphical materials; using them designers can compare, in environmental terms, design alternatives. Different combinations can be analyzed and interpolated to select the best design combinations. The implementation in an industrial case of the method and its output allow its applicability and validation. Starting from environmental data collected by the company over the years, usually used by the marketing department, a critical review has been carried out to derive, from them, useful tools to be used during design choices.},

We used commercial online electronic services for medical students to learn sexual history\textendash taking skills. Methods A total of 174 medical students viewed a lecture on sexual history taking and the PLISSIT model (Permission, Limited Information, Specific Suggestion, Intensive Therapy) and were then randomized into dyads. They arranged a time to meet online on Zoom with their partner, chose a simple sexual history case-history (male or female) from a small selection, and recorded the 5- to 6-minute sexual history within a 1-week time frame. Each student played a ``provider'' or ``patient'' and then switched roles with a new case. One of the course tutors, all sexual health practitioners, downloaded 10 videos randomly assigned to them asynchronously and viewed and commented on the interaction of each ``provider'' along with comments on what to improve in the sexual history. 2~weeks later after the remainder of the lectures in the course, a second, more complex set of 8 cases were provided, so students could move at their comfort pace and choose~1. Main Outcome Measure Students were required to make 1 online post and 1 comment on another student's post for each case, on the experience, and associated issues arising, positive or negative. All comments were downloaded and analyzed by theme. Results Major themes included developing comfort in using sexual language, using simpler sexual terms suitable for patients, feeling confidence and mastery, excitement using technology developing clinical skills, surprise watching their performances and body language, observation of how they appeared to the ``patient,'' organizing sexual histories and incorporating PLISSIT model, ability to ask about context and relationships, and seeing the exercise as building on existing clinical skills training. Some expressed anxiety and nervousness, which by the second case had largely or completely dissipated. Conclusion A readily replicable, secure, cheap cloud-based model to integrate sexual history training asynchronously was provided, with tutors' comments, and student skills development, and performance evaluated.

  abstract = {Product design is one of the most important factors to introduce the circular economy model. In this discipline, the decisions made influence the whole life cycle of the product, since the raw material obtaining to the end of life of the product. Product engineering uses resources, both technical and material to create products. In this way, among all stages that product design encompasses, most relevant and significant decisions are taken during the conceptual stage, when changes can more easily be introduced. On the other hand, creativity plays an important role in introducing new features in products (as circularity is) in a new way. To implement in a proper manner these new functionalities in the products the concepts have to be evaluated. There are methods for assessing novelty and for assessing circularity, but in the case of circularity they are focused on products that have already been developed. Moreover, these methods do not assess circularity in a holistic way, as they only cover some of the aspects that the circular economy encompasses. This work intends to fill the gap that currently exists in the tools for evaluating product concepts by designing a metric, CN\textsubscript{C}on, that measures the circularity and the novelty of conceptual proposals as a whole. The metric works according the product functions and analysing the novelty, the strategies for durability and for extending the useful life of the product that the concepts use. It also assesses the raw material and the end of life of the materials with which the concepts are designed. The development of CN\textsubscript{C}on will help to implement the circular economy paradigm while encouraging creative design solutions.},

This is done in order to ensure that all citizens stay at home to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic including the closure of all workplace premises, schools and shops. It requires the changes in the daily routine from working at the office to work from home as well as dining in at the restaurants to food delivery. These significant changes have also affected academic institutions that need to devise alternatives to accommodate the shutdowns. The situation has also challenged the education system across the world and forces educators to shift from face-to-face to an online mode of teaching. Open and Distance Learning (ODL) method is one of the most suitable strategies that integrates virtual technology which consequently allows the continuation of the teaching and learning process. There are many tools available to provide online learning platforms. A user friendly and reliable technology is essential to ensure a successful online learning process. In some situations, the technology may neither seamless nor secure, and it can detract from the learning experience. A survey was conducted to identify the students' preference for their convenience in the adoption of online learning. The results of the study can be a reference for educators to make the most suitable tools as an option for the implementation of ODL.

It is experiencing an unprecedented growth in sectors such as health, education, agriculture and citizen participation thanks to mobile technology. Local developers and entrepreneurs with the right set of skills have an important role to play in the creation of mobile services solving local problems. However, very few multi-year capacity building initiatives on mobile app development exist in the region, and universities are often slow in offering new curricula. In this paper, we present and evaluate a model of teaching mobile app development that was implemented in Senegal and used in the last six years through the MobileSenegal project. We determined the impact of this capacity building effort on participants and the Senegalese tech ecosystem by administering a survey in year five, and systematically analyzing the mobile solutions they designed throughout the years. Our findings show that participants are trained with skills that are valuable in the Senegalese job market and MobileSenegal responds to a specific need in the Senegalese tech ecosystem that is not covered by other initiatives. Further directions of MobileSenegal and its sustainability are outlined.},

  abstract = {Looking back to the rumours from the early 2000's, when the world of technology bloomed together with the curiosity towards what was next to come, by 2020, robots should have assisted and supported almost every task from our daily life. While this may seem as a Sci-Fi movie scenario, it is partially a tangible reality, that we quickly got used to, thanks to the introduction of smart speakers. As the world changes, so does the future of our students. In this respects, the evolution of the technology comes up with specific environments for educational purpose. Building smart learning environments supported by e-learning platforms is an important area of research in education domain within our days. The evolution of these smart learning environments is justified by some events (Covid19) that force students to learn remotely. The paper proposes a software application component using Alexa smart speaker, that integrates different services (Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Services) for a proper virtual environment platform, for both students and teachers. It addresses the main concerns of the current educational system, and provides a smart solution through the use of Artificial Intelligence based tools. The proposed approach not only achieves unifying data and knowledge-share mechanisms in a remotely mode, but it brings also a good learning experience, increasing the effectiveness and the efficiency of the learning process.},

  abstract = {Introduction In the spot of the new emerging COVID-19 pandemic and its major impact worldwide on day-to-day activities many rules had to be changed in order to fight this pandemic. Lockdown started in Jordan and around the globe affecting several aspects of life including economy, education, entertainment, and government policies. Regarding education, the priority was to ensure the safety and progress of the educational process. Thus, new methods of teaching had to be applied using the online learning at Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST), Faculty of Medicine. This study was done to assess (1) Class Experience (2) Students and Lecturers' Interaction (3) Online Learning Advantages \& Disadvantages (4) Students' Preference. Methods A cross sectional study was conducted Convenience sampling technique was used to collect the data from the participants using a survey composed of 18 questions on Google Forms platform. A link was sent to the undergraduate medical students at the Jordan University of Science \& Technology via their e-learning accounts (n~=~3700). The form was available from May 22nd, 2020 to May 30th, 2020 for 8 days long. Data analysis was done using SPSS V 23. Results 2212 out of 3700 students responded, (55.8\%) of them were in the basic years and (44.2\%) of them were in the clinical years. (55.8\%) of students started to take online lectures after 3 weeks. (45.7\%) used the hybrid teaching method (asynchronous and synchronous), (31.4\%) used live classes, and 22.8\% recorded classes. Zoom was the most used platform. (48.7\%) and (57\%) of clinical students and basic students express their interaction as bad, while the others had good and excellent interaction. Maintaining social distance was the most advantage of online teaching, while poor technical setup and no direct contact were the most disadvantage, furthermore inability to have real clinical access was a significant problem for clinical students (p~{$<~$}.001). With reference to students' preferences 75\% of students were not pleased with their experience and 42\% of students prefer to integrate online learning with traditional learning. Conclusion Most medical students at JUST preferred the traditional face-to-face teaching method over the solo online teaching methods with recommendations to convert to a more integrated educational system. Also, a well-established infrastructure should be done in involving online teaching.},

  abstract = {Background COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated mandatory e-learning in medical and nursing education. How far are developing countries like India (with wide socioeconomic and cultural diversity) geared up for this challenge remains unexplored. At this critical juncture, we aim to evaluate if online teaching methods are as feasible, acceptable, and effective as in-class teaching for medical/nursing students. Objectives The questionnaire captured: (1) practicability/feasibility of online classes, (2) health issues from online classes, (3) current methods for e-teaching, and (4) student attitudes and preferences. Design Cross-sectional survey. Settings Population-based study in India. Participants Nursing and medical undergraduate students (I-IV year). Methodology The online questionnaire was distributed to 200 medical and nursing colleges across India. Categorical variables were analyzed using chi-square tests. Binary logistic regression was done to analyze factors predicting health issues in students. p~{$<~$}0.05 was considered significant. Results Overall, 1541 medical and 684 nursing students completed the survey from 156 cities. The availability of laptop (p~{$<~$}0.0001), Wi-Fi (p~{$<~$}0.0001), dedicated room (p~{$<~$}0.0001), and computer proficiency was more in students of affluent families and those from cities (p~{$<~$}0.0001). Class duration {$>$}4~h/day (p~{$<~$}0.0001), each class {$>$}40~min (p~{$<~$}0.009) and pre-existing health issues (p~{$<~$}0.0001) predicted the occurrence headache, eyestrain, anxiety, neck/back pain, and sleep disturbance. Power-point presentation was the most widely (80\%) used method of teaching. Only 30\% got adequate time to interact with teachers. Only 20.4\% felt e-learning can replace conventional teaching. Students preferred: 3\textendash 6 classes/day, each class {$<$}40~min, 10\textendash 20~min break between classes and interactive sessions. Conclusion There is a need to improve information and communication infrastructure to enhance feasibility of e-learning for nursing/medical students in India. There should be guidelines (number of classes/day, length of each class, break between classes, curriculum, etc) to improve the retention capacity in students and reduce health issues. Continuous feedback from teachers and students will be required to make e-learning effective.},

Using an ecologies concept to explore how lay investors are articulated into global financial networks through robo advisors, this paper contributes to studies on the ``financialization of everyday life''. It argues that investors are rendered passive by the disciplinary tools of algorithms, contemporary finance theories and elements of robo-advisor platforms that feed into these sociotechnological assemblages. The state's role in embedding citizen investors in these human-machine relationships is considered. The fragmented landscape of free, nonprofessional online financial advice and the opaque qualities of investing algorithms make investor subject formation incomplete and uncertain, especially when markets are highly volatile. This paper explores how both financial inclusion and exclusion operate simultaneously in robo-advisors and argues that robo-advisors may weaken efforts to promote financial literacy and education.},

  abstract = {Amid the coronavirus outbreak, many countries are facing a dramatic situation in terms of the global economy and human social activities, including education. The shutdown of schools is affecting many students around the world, with face-to-face classes suspended. Many countries facing the disastrous situation imposed class suspension at an early stage of the coronavirus outbreak, and Asia was one of the earliest regions to implement live online learning. Despite previous research on online teaching and learning, students' readiness to participate in the real-time online learning implemented during the coronavirus outbreak is not yet well understood. This study explored several key factors in the research framework related to learning motivation, learning readiness and student's self-efficacy in participating in live online learning during the coronavirus outbreak, taking into account gender differences and differences among sub-degree (SD), undergraduate (UG) and postgraduate (PG) students. Technology readiness was used instead of conventional online/internet self-efficacy to determine students' live online learning readiness. The hypothetical model was validated using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The results revealed no statistically significant differences between males and females. On the other hand, the mean scores for PG students were higher than for UG and SD students based on the post hoc test. We argue that during the coronavirus outbreak, gender differences were reduced because students are forced to learn more initiatively. We also suggest that students studying at a higher education degree level may have higher expectations of their academic achievement and were significantly different in their online learning readiness. This study has important implications for educators in implementing live online learning, particularly for the design of teaching contexts for students from different educational levels. More virtual activities should be considered to enhance the motivation for students undertaking lower-level degrees, and encouragement of student-to-student interactions can be considered.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        A brain-computer interface that decodes continuous language from non-invasive recordings would have many scientific and practical applications. Currently, however, decoders that reconstruct continuous language use invasive recordings from surgically implanted electrodes             1\textendash 3             , while decoders that use non-invasive recordings can only identify stimuli from among a small set of letters, words, or phrases             4\textendash 7             . Here we introduce a non-invasive decoder that reconstructs continuous natural language from cortical representations of semantic meaning             8             recorded using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Given novel brain recordings, this decoder generates intelligible word sequences that recover the meaning of perceived speech, imagined speech, and even silent videos, demonstrating that a single language decoder can be applied to a range of semantic tasks. To study how language is represented across the brain, we tested the decoder on different cortical networks, and found that natural language can be separately decoded from multiple cortical networks in each hemisphere. As brain-computer interfaces should respect mental privacy             9             , we tested whether successful decoding requires subject cooperation, and found that subject cooperation is required both to train and to apply the decoder. Our study demonstrates that continuous language can be decoded from non-invasive brain recordings, enabling future multipurpose brain-computer interfaces.},

  abstract = {Microplastic pollution is increasingly recognised as a global environmental challenge which stems from the rapid growth of the use of petrochemical-derived plastic. As researchers and practitioners face a myriad of environmental challenges, oceanic microplastic pollution has so far dominated interest. However, airborne microplastics present an increasing environmental and public health concern. There is currently a need for research addressing this emerging challenge, and at the same time, the lack of knowledge and consensus regarding airborne microplastics presents an obstacle to action. The purpose of this study is to utilise a participatory Structured Decision-Making (SDM) approach to understand the perspectives of a range of stakeholders involved in the microplastics landscape, and subsequently refine common research priorities and knowledge gaps to advance the field. Through two participatory workshops, we first defined shared objectives of stakeholders and then negotiated best courses of action to achieve these objectives based on discussion between stakeholders and facilitators. The qualitative approach taken has enabled the full, complex and multidisciplinary aspects of the research into airborne microplastic pollution to be considered. Our findings highlight some important potential consequences of airborne microplastic pollution, including impacts on human health, and the need for more interdisciplinary research, and collaborative, integrated approaches in this area. As a result of the first workshop, five fundamental objectives on the theme of airborne microplastics were identified. As a direct consequence of this, participants identified 84 actions split across eight themes, which are outlined later in this paper.},

During the product development process the designer will think about the environmental impact of the new product for each phase of the life cycle, starting from the extraction of the raw materials, production of materials out of these raw materials, the production techniques to transform the materials into components, assembly of these components into products, the distribution and packaging of the products, the use phase (the impact of consumables and energy consumption), and finally the end of use phase by the consumer. The possibility of repair, upgrade, remanufacture of products and the improvement of the recyclability of the materials starts with the design of the product. Ecodesign guidelines support the designer making decisions during the product development process. The ecodesign guidelines are often classified as ``design for X'' approaches, where X stands for the different phase in the life cycle of the product. These ecodesign guidelines are brought together in ecodesign tools. Three of these qualitative ecodesign tools are presented in this chapter. To verify all these ecodesign guidelines, the designer will be informed by each partner in the value chain to look for the best compromise. The designer has a key role in the chain collaboration, which is necessary for the transition to the circular economy. The designer's aim is to, develop products and services that fit in the circular economy with the ecodesign principles as a guide. Ecodesign can be considered as the copilot during the product development process. The designer always looks for the best compromise between the ecodesign guidelines and the other requirements of the product (technical, economic, and human-related).},

United States Department of Energy dynamic building energy analytical software, eQUEST, is used to execute the strictest energy consumption analytical assessment. It is forecasted to reach an energy-saving efficiency of 65\% with energy use intensity (EUI) of 43 kWh/m(2).yr for the whole building, far below that of 169 kWh/m(2).yr found in Taiwan low/mid-rise office buildings. This building has begun operation in 2011, through actual readings from Building Energy Management System (BEMS) during January to June, first-half-year accumulated EUI of 19.3 kWh/m(2).yr against eQUEST analytical assessment of 22.5 kWh/m(2).yr for the same period. Actual energy consumption analysis for air conditioning, lighting, socket outlet, and power equipment, respectively recorded 41.7\%, 11\%, 22.3\%, and 25\% in June. Demonstrating that eQUEST analytical assessed value is very consistent with building's actual energy consumption readings. The energy consumption standard in the experimental research behind the Magic School of Green Technology stands at world class.}

Net-based learning has become an indispensable tool, and the distance learning system on campus has risen gradually. In order to promote distance learning more effectively, this study attempts to reveal the mentality of teachers, and proposes a willing-of-usage model as a reference for related researchers. Based on the verified TAM (Technology Acceptance Model) model, this study proposed a new model which considers the interface design, the functionality, information literacy, teacher background and organizational support as the external factors. In this study, questionnaires for college teachers around the country are collected on the Internet to understand the will of using distance learning. The data is analyzed using the SPSS and the method of SEM (Structural Equation Modeling). Both reliability and validity are analyzed, and the methodology of factor analysis and path analysis is used to verify the hypothesis and to understand the positive factors that affect the usage of distance learning platform. Structural Equation Models analysis revealed that the paths of the TAM model achieve the significant level, and degree of the model fitness was mostly good. The results showed that the system functionality and interface design only significant affect the degree of ease of use; the organizational support in schools affects the usefulness and ease of use; the information literacy and teacher background only affects usefulness. This study also found that in order to promote the willing of distance learning platform usage, it would be useful if school support such as teaching assistant and career training can be provided.},

  abstract = {Rising environmental issues are now a global concern, in part due to human behaviour which is generally not environmentally friendly in doing daily living activities such as littering, excessive vehicle use, wasteful resources consumption, combustion of fossil fuel, consume non-recyclable product and consume non-organic product. An emerged behavioural change approach known as ``nudging'' offers an insight to promote pro-environmental behaviour amongst people by influencing people's decisions with choice architecture. This paper aims to review the status quo of pro-environmental context in nudging for behaviour change and the nudging techniques that are available for selection to promote pro-environmental behaviour. PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework was adopted in this review. A total of 37 eligible articles were identified from acknowledged databases, Web of Science (WOS) and SCOPUS for inclusion of review. This review found that the majority of nudging studies show positive effects in nudging the targeted behaviour of people and demonstrate that the nudging technique has great potential to influence pro-environmental behaviour. Furthermore, this review presented seven types of nudging techniques (prompting, sizing, proximity, presentation, priming, labelling, functional design) which can be adopted for pro-environmental purposes. This paper provides an insight for pro-environmentalists and stakeholders into the usefulness of the nudging approach and how it can be applied in pro-environmental context. The concepts of implementation and recommendations for each nudging technique are described in this paper.},

This has become the greatest challenge of decade to deal with it. Globally, scientists and researchers were busy in finding a way to deal with this deadly pandemic. As this pandemic breaks out a huge demand for healthcare equipment, medicinal facilities has been rises and Industry 4.0 seems to be a hope during this pandemic which has potential to satisfy all these needs. In the battle, against this pandemic branches of computer science: Artificial Intelligence(AI), Internet of Things(IoT), Robotics, Machine Learning(ML) and Deep Learning(DL) played very important roles. Without the help of IoT and Robotics it would be impossible for frontline warriors to remain contactless with an infected person. Meanwhile, rapid testing, prediction of disease, sentiment analysis of population and many more would be only possible due to presence ML and DL algorithms. Undoubtedly, if this pandemichappened before the emergence of AI, IoT, ML, DL and Robotics; then the aftermath will surely be something else. This paper will highlight the contribution of these technologies in handling this pandemic from its treatment to management. This paper will give idea about the role of technologies, their affects, solutions provided by them, improvement needed in healthcare facilities, their role in managing sentiments of public during pandemic. The innovative part of this paper is that we are exploring each field of industry 4.0 and observing which plays the most important role.},

However, human distrust of AI is a critical factor that may impede human-AI cooperation. Although AI agents have been endowed with anthropomorphic traits, such as a human-like appearance, in prior studies to improve human trust in AI, it is still an open question whether humans have more trust in an AI teammate and achieve better human-AI joint performance if they are deceived about the identity of their AI teammate as another human. This research assesses the effects of teammate identity (``human'' vs. AI) and teammate performance (low-performing vs. high-performing AI) on human-AI cooperation through a human subjects study. The results of this study show that humans behaviorally trust the AI more than another human by accepting their AI teammate's decisions more often. In addition, teammate performance has a significant effect on human-AI joint performance in the study, while teammate identity does not. These results caution against deceiving humans about the identity of AI in future applications involving human-AI cooperation.},
