Like other emergencies, as COVID-19 is announced as a pandemic, all countries have started trying to control the situation with technological advancement in the medical sector, educational progress, and in the continuity of productions. As most of the educational institutions have been closed since March and the learning process in higher education has moved online, therefore, developing countries like Bangladesh are also trying to continue classes through the online platform with a lack of technological resources, readiness, and inclusiveness from the perspective of the students. This quantitative study surveyed over 844 students of different universities of Bangladesh to analyze the status of preparedness, participation, and classroom activities through online during the pandemic. The findings revealed a lack of preparedness, participation, and less scope of classroom activities through online learning. Problems of infeasible consistency of the internet and electricity, paying attention, understanding lessons through the online platform are the main constraints of online learning in the developing country. Finding ways of mitigating these problems can be the next subject for further researchers.},

  abstract = {Following the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in China in late December 2019, more than 217 countries became almost immediately infected in the resulting pandemic. Consequently, many of them decided to close their educational institutions as a way of preventing the spread of this virus. For many of them, though, the closure made them unable to deliver learning materials to students owing to their inability to provide the right technology for the purpose. To assist with the digitalizing of learning during this time, this study reviews the most common technologies used in the delivery of learning materials, with the experience of most infected countries being considered. Major challenges in online learning are discussed in this study as well. Further, Saudi Arabia was considered as a case study for the effectiveness of distance learning during the 2020 spring semester, where 300 undergraduate students were surveyed on their opinions of distance learning. The responses to the survey indicated that distance learning was effective in providing the required knowledge to the students during the outbreak of COVID-19. The findings showed that although the lack of interaction and poor internet connections were factors affecting comfortable and successful learning of physics and mathematics, 63\% of students were satisfied with learning management systems, 75\% of students found it easy to understand course materials, and 67\% of students found it easy to understand assignments and could deal with them comfortably. The study findings can encourage educational institutions to digitalize their learning materials in the future.},

  abstract = {The renowned cultural theorist and media designer Anne Balsamo maintains that technology and culture are inseparable; those who engage in technological innovation are designing the cultures of the future. Designing Culture is a call for taking culture seriously in the design and development of innovative technologies. Balsamo contends that the wellspring of technological innovation is the technological imagination, a quality of mind that enables people to think with technology, to transform what is known into what is possible. She describes the technological imagination at work in several multimedia collaborations in which she was involved as a designer or developer. One of these entailed the creation of an interactive documentary for the NGO Forum held in conjunction with the UN World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995. (That documentary is included as a DVD in Designing Culture.) Balsamo also recounts the development of the interactive museum exhibit XFR: Experiments in the Future of Reading, created by the group RED (Research in Experimental Documents) at Xerox PARC. She speculates on what it would mean to cultivate imaginations as ingenious in creating new democratic cultural possibilities as they are in creating new kinds of technologies and digital media. Designing Culture is a manifesto for transforming educational programs and developing learning strategies adequate to the task of inspiring culturally attuned technological imaginations.},

  abstract = {Technological developments have given shape to robotic services which have forayed in the finance and investment industry in the form of Robo-advisors. Robo-advisors are in use in the developed nations since over a decade but have recently entered the developing nations, like India, since early 2015. This research explores the present state of Robo-advisory services in the Indian context and investigates how Robo-advisors can help in mitigating behavioral biases of a retail investor. The present study gives an in-depth understanding about the ability of Robo-advisory to mitigate behavioral biases from the perspective of experts. These experts are from the product development team, quality control team, middleware, or at top management level from BFSI (Banking and Financial Services Industry), IT (Information Technology), FINTECH (Finance Technology) and NBFCs (Non-Banking Finance Companies) in India. The researchers have adopted a qualitative approach, of interviewing these experts, to discover the phenomenon and gain insight about Robo-advisory services. Each interview was recorded and transcribed on word-for-word basis. The transcribed content underwent a structured content analysis, using different categories, resulting from the conducted literature review. The intent is not to generalize the findings, since the field of Robo-advisory is at a nascent stage as far as Indian market is concerned. The key findings indicate that the current focus is to increase awareness level amongst investors, by educating them and by building trust. Our conclusion emphasizes the fact that Robo-advisors still need to mitigate investor's biases while performing risk analysis and profiling the investors. Robo-advisory platforms are not yet comprehensively self-sufficient to accurately perform risk analysis for retail investors.},

The air exchange rate in the conference hall was between 5.73 ACH and 9.11 ACH, which exceeded the minimum air ventilation rate required in Taiwan. This shows that a passive solar chimney can effectively applied to the conference hall to meet indoor ventilation and air exchange requirements without using air conditioning.}

The project used photovoice and focus groups conducted via Zoom videoconferencing software. Eleven participants shared photographs, discussing their meaning and significance in relation to `safe spaces'. The photographs were then synthesised into an artist's impression of a safe space and transcripts of the online photovoice discussion analysed thematically and triangulated with the artist's impression. The paper provides a reflexive discussion of the research process and explores methodological and ethical implications of conducting sensitive qualitative research in online spaces.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT The Helsinki Central Library is a landmark project, delivered as part of the ?Finland 100? programme to celebrate 100 years of the independence of Finland. ALA architects delivered the winning entry to the architectural competition held in 2013. In 2014 Ramboll Finland won the structural design contract for the project, taking the project from conceptual architectural design through to completion of construction in 2018. The main structural system is fundamentally a steel frame solution designed to Eurocode. Two EXC4 classified, 109m span, tilted arches carry the two main floors and roof of the building. Post-tensioned cables tie the bases of the arches to provide a tied-arch structure. Other post-tensioned cables in the floor system and concrete cores hold the tilting arches in position. Transverse trusses allow the cantilevering balcony to be delivered. 2400t of steel have been used to deliver the main frame structural solution. With careful and considered design, fabrication and construction, high quality to good tolerances and stringent requirements have been successfully achieved. An overview of the bridge-like structural system that has been conceived and developed for the project shall be presented. Some of the challenges encountered and resolved in the design shall be discussed, as well as an overview of key decisions made to handle project delivery budget and timetable requirements.},

  abstract = {Speculative Design is an approach that considers alternate futures for technology and society. Through prototyping and/or defining scenarios, important discussions about ethics or the impact of design on the environment and culture can be brought to the forefront of the design process. Sometimes considered alarmist and sensational, it's still a powerful tool for design.  Companies are applying this approach to business strategies or articulating visions for emerging technologies. They are speculating on everything from the future of their products to eliciting communities for input to developing new services. Speculative Design's potential for application is so diverse that it can be used as a lens to consider a more holistic approach to problems and uncover new questions about the future that we may have never asked.  Phil shares several projects from Apple's early vision of the iPad to how governments are using it to design new services today. He also covers some basic framework for how to begin looking at the future and consider all the potential factors and environments that could influence your products or services.

Generated using a moderated focus group discussion with principals and teachers, the findings suggest that principals' and teachers' leadership practices are acceptable in the policy, social support, and financial dimensions but still lack structural and teaching aspects about conducting blended learning. Based on this study's findings, pesantren leaders (kyai) and school principals should pay attention to training programs for implementing blended learning for teachers. The government is encouraged to assist in providing technical facilities pesantren can implement blended learning more effectively.},

This study simulates the interior lighting of the International Conference Hall in the Magic School of Green Technology (MSGT) using high efficiency ceramic metal halide lamps that replace the general design luminaires, and PL and fluorescent lamps. We use the secondary reflection of light to reduce glare and improve lighting uniformity. The results show that high efficiency lighting can reduce by 25\% the standard lighting equipment and still provide the same illumination levels. Furthermore, the overall conference hall lighting uniformity increases from 0.59 to 0.78.}

The bulk of the literature on environmental corporate social responsibility suggests that this type of behavior even results in higher profit. However, a product-differentiation framework with perfect competition predicts that renewable energy use has no effect on profit. This paper tests this prediction by investigating the relationship between firms' renewable energy use and profit on the basis of panel data for 920 firms over 2014\textendash 2018. We do not find evidence for an impact of renewable energy use on profit. Hence, a `win-win' in the form of higher profit and a better environment does not seem to exist. In addition, the results appear to suggest that firms do not have a positive willingness to pay for renewable energy as contribution to the environment. This implies that firms are only willing to contribute to climate-change mitigation through buying renewable energy when this is aligned with the profit-maximization objective.},

The results showed that online teaching during pandemic had been performed regularly in synchronous meetings format. Both faculty and students were satisfied with online teaching in theoretical courses. However, both groups were less satisfied with the design and basic design courses.

The COVID-19 pandemic has suddenly and abruptly forced schools and education indeed to engage in such a transformation. In this study we examine the digital transformation initiated by the COVID-19 pandemic in the basic education of the young generation, the variety of digital divides emerging and reinforced, and the possible barriers reported along the way. We argue that information management research should better acknowledge children, their digitalized everyday life and their basic education as significant areas of concern. We should understand them as well as allow them to shape the education we offer in the context of higher education, but we should also aim at influencing the basic education of the young generation \textendash{} for the purpose of equipping them with important skills and competencies for their digital futures but also for the purpose of arousing their interest in this important field, maybe even as a career option.},

In an attempt to understand and propose solutions to this challenge, the authors of this paper set out to: test an innovative combination of methods to generate and evaluate ideas and strategies; and to write about the findings using collaborative online methods. During this process universities in the UK moved to online working and so the authors completed this paper through entirely online means. The authors - a team of academic researchers from the University of AAA - came together in sessions designed as a hybrid of World Caf\'e and Delphi technique approaches to discuss challenges and solutions. The findings were written up drawing on insights from the use of massively authored papers (also known as `massively open online papers', MOOPs), and online tools to enable remote collaboration. Expert consensus was sought in this project within a group of participants (N~\hspace{0pt}=~\hspace{0pt}7) in one university setting to create a MOOP. This paper presents details of the process, the findings, and reflections on this collaborative and cooperative exercise. That this paper was written using the methods discussed within it, highlights the value and success of the approach. In light of the current Coronavirus pandemic and the increased need to work remotely, this paper offers academics useful strategies for meaningful and productive online collaboration.},

An online survey was conducted from 1 May to 8 May 2020 to collect the information. A structural questionnaire link using `Google form' was sent to students' through WhatsApp and E-mail. A total of 232 students provided complete information regarding the survey. The simple percentage distribution was used to assess the learning status of the study participants. During the lockdown period, around 70\% of learners were involved in e-learning. Most of the learners were used android mobile for attending e-learning. Students have been facing various problems related to depression anxiety, poor internet connectivity, and unfavorable study environment at home. Students from remote areas and marginalized sections mainly face enormous challenges for the study during this pandemic. This study suggests targeted interventions to create a positive space for study among students from the vulnerable section of society. Strategies are urgently needed to build a resilient education system in the state that will ensure to develop the skill for employability and the productivity of the young minds.},

The review focuses on two main areas of research \textendash{} the effects of geometry and inclination angle on the ventilation performance of a solar chimney. The experimental investigations of solar chimney have dominated the existing literature. However, numerical modelling of solar chimney using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique has attracted increasing attention.

Teaching online during the COVID pandemic has turned out to be an adaptive and transformative challenge for teachers. Though Indian teachers are used to the chalk-and-talk method, an online setup has compelled them to discover innovative strategies to maintain an inclusive classroom. It was found that teachers are using puppetry, storytelling, energizers, ice-breakers in their sessions to make it engaging. An in-depth study was undertaken to understand the experiences of five primary class teachers from private schools in India. Data thus collected were analyzed qualitatively. The study results demonstrated that the teachers had improved professionally\textemdash{} they have become independent in using the internet and exploring new ways of teaching them per their needs. Nevertheless, it was also found that the schools lack support, fear among the teachers of being asked to quit the job, blocking students from the online class if they fail to pay the fees, and exorbitant salary cuts. The challenges related to young students were - lack of proper resources for online sessions, low attention span, technical distractions, lack of physical development, excessive interference of the parents and lack of socialization. The paper concludes with policy proposals regarding standardized online education platforms and provisions for proper resources for virtual class sessions to marginalized families to minimize India's digital divide.},

However, we know quite little about whether such action can also generate benefits for firms induced by political action, such as benefits associated with public procurement, (softer) regulatory enforcement and corporate tax breaks. We argue that citizens are more likely to support such rewards for firms that have a stronger record of environmental business conduct, express stronger commitment to future environmental action and submit such action to independent audits. The empirical analysis focuses on vehicle emissions reduction by car producers and plastic waste reduction by retailers. Choice experiments with 6726 respondents from Germany and the United States support these arguments. Our findings are surprisingly consistent across two different sociocultural and political contexts (Germany, USA), two different environmental policy domains (vehicle emissions, plastic waste) and three forms of political rewards. Whereas studies focusing on narrowly defined economic benefits (competitiveness) of environmental business conduct have become somewhat more sceptical about the magnitude and scope of such benefits, our results provide more room for optimism by pointing to other types of benefits of corporate environmental action.},

Moreover, negative affect in relation to SRI contributed as an observable factor to explain variance heterogeneity while experience in fund savings, positive product involvement as well as positive affect were not significant. Our main finding is, however, that latent behavioral characteristics of the investors are strong predictors of latent class membership thereby contributing to distinguish nontrivial investor sub-groups. We find no support for the contribution of sociodemographic characteristics. These results can serve to identify market segments so that equity fund offerings, including those related to SRI, can be mobilized, optimized and tailored to meet the demand for SRI among private investors.},

  abstract = {The shift to distance teaching and learning during the COVID-19 pandemic brought about a real challenge for both instructors and students. To face these difficulties in teaching undergraduate Chemistry courses at the University of Santo Tomas, a blended learning strategy in the context of teaching and learning of Physical Chemistry 1 and Analytical Chemistry for Chemical Engineering students were employed. Here, we present an online strategy that facilitated the transition from traditional face-to-face learning to full online instruction. This is a five-component blended learning strategy referred to as Discover, Learn, Practice, Collaborate and Assess (DLPCA). In DLPCA, the asynchronous part of the teaching was achieved through broadcast of pre-recorded lecture videos on YouTube to allow students to study and progress with learning at their own pace. The synchronous part of the teaching was conducted using video conferencing platforms, such as Zoom or Google Meet. The DLPCA strategy was presented and discussed to the students prior to its implementation. The analysis of the teaching and learning experience based on three indicators (i) student's learning experience, (ii) student's academic performance and (iii) instructor observations showed that DLPCA had a positive impact on students and instructors. The identified challenges were stability of internet connection and instructor's familiarity with readily available internet-based teaching tools, such as video conferencing software. Instructors must also find means to improve their interaction with students and maintain student interest and engagement during online classes. The survey also indicated that most of the students are satisfied with the DLCPA strategy. Hence, this strategy is considered a manageable and effective alternative that can be adapted to full online instruction to other undergraduate Chemistry lecture courses. Overall, the findings and insights in this study will add valuable resources for further hybrid instruction in the post-COVID-19 time in higher education.},

The results of DY suggest that, first, the total connectedness of 21st century technology assets and traditional common stocks is very high, and hence in the turbulent economy, there is a high probability of contemporaneous losses. Second, Bitcoin, MSCIW, MSCI US, and KFTX are net contributors of volatility shocks whereas US dollar, oil, gold, VIX, green bond and green bond select are net receivers. Therefore, Fintech and common equities are not good hedging instruments in the same portfolio. Third, the short-term witnesses higher volatility transmission than the long-term. That is, holding assets for a long-term is likely to mitigate risks whereas trading financial assets in the short-term can increase risk because of higher volatility. Fourth, the traditional assets, gold and oil, as well as modern assets, green bonds, are useful as good hedgers compared with other assets because shock transmissions from them to Fintech, KFTX are below 0.1\% and, more importantly, the total volatility spill-over of all assets in the sample is moderately average, accounting for 44.39\%.},

Both advice tasks are increasingly offered through automated online technologies. Little is known, however, about what drives individuals' acceptance of such automated financial advice and, from a consumer point of view, which firms may be best positioned to provide such advice. We generate novel insights on these questions by conducting a real-world empirical study using an interactive automated online tool that employs an innovative computer algorithm to build pension investment profiles, the ``Pension Builder,'' and a large, representative sample. We focus on the role that two key firm characteristics have on consumer acceptance of pension investment advice generated by computer algorithms running on automated interactive online tools: profit orientation and role in the sales channel. We find that consumers' perceptions of trust and expertise of the firm providing the automated advice are important drivers of advice acceptance (besides a strong impact of the satisfaction with the consumer\textendash online tool interaction), and that these constructs themselves are clearly influenced by the for-profit vs. not-for-profit orientation and the product provider vs. advisor only role in the sales channel of the firm providing the advice. We discuss the implications of our findings for marketers and policy makers and provide suggestions for future research.},

This study is a portrayal of online teaching-learning modes adopted by the Mizoram University for the teaching-learning process and subsequent semester examinations. It looks forward to an intellectually enriched opportunity for further future academic decision-making during any adversity. The intended purpose of this paper seeks to address the required essentialities of online teaching-learning in education amid the COVID-19 pandemic and how can existing resources of educational institutions effectively transform formal education into online education with the help of virtual classes and other pivotal online tools in this continually shifting educational landscape. The paper employs both quantitative and qualitative approach to study the perceptions of teachers and students on online teaching-learning modes and also highlighted the implementation process of online teaching-learning modes. The value of this paper is to draw a holistic picture of ongoing online teaching-learning activities during the lockdown period including establishing the linkage between change management process and online teaching-learning process in education system amid the COVID-19 outbreak so as to overcome the persisting academic disturbance and consequently ensure the resumption of educational activities and discourses as a normal course of procedure in the education system.},

However, controlled laboratory and crowdsourcing settings often introduce issues of artificiality, data contamination, and low managerial relevance of the dependent variables. Field experiments can overcome these issues but are traditionally time- and resource-consuming. This primer presents an alternative experimental setting to conduct online field experiments in a time- and cost-effective way. It does so by introducing the Facebook A/B split test functionality, which allows for random assignment of manipulated variables embedded in ecologically-valid stimuli. We compare and contrast this method against laboratory settings and Amazon Mechanical Turk in terms of design flexibility, managerial relevance, data quality control, and sample representativeness. We then provide an empirical demonstration of how to set up, pre-test, run, and analyze FBST experiments.},

A quantitative approach based on survey method was used to collect data from 340 LIS students from nine public sector universities of Pakistan through an online questionnaire. The collected data was analyzed using the SPSS and AMOS. The findings revealed that LIS students were not fully personalized and successful in decisions about their online educational activities during COVID-19 pandemic. However, they were motivated to learn through online learning and felt confident in performing basic functions of computers and internet. A significant difference of opinion was observed on `computer/internet self-efficacy' and `online communication self-efficacy' based on respondents' gender. Similarly, students from different levels of degree programs reported significantly different computer, internet, and online communication self-efficacy and learning motivation. Moreover, the age and grades of respondents were noted to be strong predictors of their OLR. These findings would be helpful for library schools, universities, and faculty members in Pakistan to improve the quality of online education and implement clear policies and guidelines. This study provides some theoretical and practical implications based on the findings.},

  abstract = {This study explored how university students remained motivated to learn, despite all the limitations they encountered and endured during the COVID-19 pandemic. This work was carried out in Indonesia, but the benefits are beyond a stateboundary. The study examines how university students in developing countries have faced obstacles, and yet despite this, they are still trying their hardest to stay focused on achieving their personal goals during the pandemic. This research employed a qualitative phenomenological approach, involving eighty students that were studying at the Faculty of Education at a state university in Jakarta, Indonesia. As data collection techniques, students were asked to write learning log diaries and reflective essays and to participate in an online focus group discussion. The results showed that the students' motivation to remain learning during the COVID-19 pandemic fell into three key themes, each with associated sub-themes. The three themes and sub-themes described were: (a) personal, with sub-themes of challenge, curiosity, self-determination, satisfaction and religious commitment; (b) social, with sub-themes of relationships, inspiration, and well-being of self and others; and (c) environmental, with sub-themes of facilities and conditioning. The themes and sub-themes indicate the source of motivation for these university students to learn during the pandemic. This study concluded that these emerging adults were both intrinsically and extrinsically autonomously motivated and committed to their studies. Most of these students were motivated by their consequential aspirations, not by a controlled motivation, nor were they motivated by a reward, a penalty, or a rule that propelled them. By defining how the students managed to empower themselves, this study recommends the importance of preparing students to be more resilient and to enable them to cultivate the ability to remain optimistic and motivated to succeed and overcome any of life's adversities.},

  abstract = {Purpose Academia is experiencing massive reforms globally amid lockdown in COVID-19 outbreak. This study is aimed to apprehend the enabling and impeding factors of these reforms, with a focus on optometry education. It brings together how the Indian optometry educational system has responded to COVID-19 disruptions with findings of the 2020 survey, in light of similar survey done in 2018. Methodology A cross-sectional survey was designed to find changes in optometry training and adaptations of Indian optometry educators amid COVID 19 lockdown. In the last week of April 2020, on the observation that the majority of optometry institutions have switched their teaching-learning activities on e-learning mode, an online survey was conducted using a validated questionnaire containing a mix of open and close-ended questions. Results Seventy-three out of 78 optometry educators (93.58\%) have switched to e-learning mode in a very short time span with good confidence. Most teaching-learning and assessment activities are carried out using multi-device supporting video conferencing tools, dedicated educational portals and social media apps. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic is proving to be a constructive disruptor, giving an opportunity for restructuring the present conventional, classroom based educational system. The quick transitions to online mode assisted in keeping continuity of optometry education programs, effectively fitting in the purpose of completion of the current academic year. The rapid transition to online education has not only benefited optometry students but also has created a momentum of continued education for practicing optometrist in the country. Resumen Prop\'osito: La Academia est\'a experimentando reformas masivas a nivel mundial en medio del bloqueo del brote del COVID-19. Este estudio tiene como objetivo aprehender los factores favorables y desfavorables de estas reformas, con un enfoque en la educaci\'on de la optometr\'ia. Re\'une c\'omo el sistema educativo de optometr\'ia de la India ha respondido a los trastornos del COVID-19 con los resultados de la encuesta de 2020, a la luz de una encuesta similar realizada en 2018. Metodolog\'ia: Una encuesta transversal fue dise\~nada para encontrar cambios en la formaci\'on de optometr\'ia y adaptaciones de los educadores de optometr\'ia de la India en medio del cierre del COVID 19. En la \'ultima semana de abril de 2020, a partir de la observaci\'on de que la mayor\'ia de las instituciones de optometr\'ia han cambiado sus actividades de ense\~nanza-aprendizaje en el modo de aprendizaje electr\'onico, se realiz\'o una encuesta en l\'inea utilizando un cuestionario validado que conten\'ia una mezcla de preguntas abiertas y cerradas. Resultados: Setenta y tres de 78 educadores de optometr\'ia (93,58\%) han cambiado a la modalidad de aprendizaje electr\'onico en un per\'iodo de tiempo muy corto con buena confianza. La mayor\'ia de las actividades de ense\~nanza-aprendizaje y evaluaci\'on se llevan a cabo utilizando herramientas de videoconferencia de apoyo multidispositivo, portales educativos dedicados y aplicaciones de redes sociales. Conclusi\'on: La pandemia del COVID-19 est\'a demostrando ser un disruptor constructivo, que ofrece la oportunidad de reestructurar el actual sistema educativo convencional basado en el aula. Las r\'apidas transiciones al modo online ayudaron a mantener la continuidad de los programas educativos de optometr\'ia, encajando eficazmente en el prop\'osito de completar el a\~no acad\'emico actual. La r\'apida transici\'on a la educaci\'on en l\'inea no s\'olo ha beneficiado a los estudiantes de optometr\'ia, sino que tambi\'en ha creado un impulso de educaci\'on continua para los optometristas en ejercicio en el pa\'is.},

We used commercial online electronic services for medical students to learn sexual history\textendash taking skills. Methods A total of 174 medical students viewed a lecture on sexual history taking and the PLISSIT model (Permission, Limited Information, Specific Suggestion, Intensive Therapy) and were then randomized into dyads. They arranged a time to meet online on Zoom with their partner, chose a simple sexual history case-history (male or female) from a small selection, and recorded the 5- to 6-minute sexual history within a 1-week time frame. Each student played a ``provider'' or ``patient'' and then switched roles with a new case. One of the course tutors, all sexual health practitioners, downloaded 10 videos randomly assigned to them asynchronously and viewed and commented on the interaction of each ``provider'' along with comments on what to improve in the sexual history. 2~weeks later after the remainder of the lectures in the course, a second, more complex set of 8 cases were provided, so students could move at their comfort pace and choose~1. Main Outcome Measure Students were required to make 1 online post and 1 comment on another student's post for each case, on the experience, and associated issues arising, positive or negative. All comments were downloaded and analyzed by theme. Results Major themes included developing comfort in using sexual language, using simpler sexual terms suitable for patients, feeling confidence and mastery, excitement using technology developing clinical skills, surprise watching their performances and body language, observation of how they appeared to the ``patient,'' organizing sexual histories and incorporating PLISSIT model, ability to ask about context and relationships, and seeing the exercise as building on existing clinical skills training. Some expressed anxiety and nervousness, which by the second case had largely or completely dissipated. Conclusion A readily replicable, secure, cheap cloud-based model to integrate sexual history training asynchronously was provided, with tutors' comments, and student skills development, and performance evaluated.

This is done in order to ensure that all citizens stay at home to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic including the closure of all workplace premises, schools and shops. It requires the changes in the daily routine from working at the office to work from home as well as dining in at the restaurants to food delivery. These significant changes have also affected academic institutions that need to devise alternatives to accommodate the shutdowns. The situation has also challenged the education system across the world and forces educators to shift from face-to-face to an online mode of teaching. Open and Distance Learning (ODL) method is one of the most suitable strategies that integrates virtual technology which consequently allows the continuation of the teaching and learning process. There are many tools available to provide online learning platforms. A user friendly and reliable technology is essential to ensure a successful online learning process. In some situations, the technology may neither seamless nor secure, and it can detract from the learning experience. A survey was conducted to identify the students' preference for their convenience in the adoption of online learning. The results of the study can be a reference for educators to make the most suitable tools as an option for the implementation of ODL. The selection of appropriate tools is vital in order to ensure that no student is left behind as well as to make sure the teaching and learning process a success.},

It is experiencing an unprecedented growth in sectors such as health, education, agriculture and citizen participation thanks to mobile technology. Local developers and entrepreneurs with the right set of skills have an important role to play in the creation of mobile services solving local problems. However, very few multi-year capacity building initiatives on mobile app development exist in the region, and universities are often slow in offering new curricula. In this paper, we present and evaluate a model of teaching mobile app development that was implemented in Senegal and used in the last six years through the MobileSenegal project. We determined the impact of this capacity building effort on participants and the Senegalese tech ecosystem by administering a survey in year five, and systematically analyzing the mobile solutions they designed throughout the years. Our findings show that participants are trained with skills that are valuable in the Senegalese job market and MobileSenegal responds to a specific need in the Senegalese tech ecosystem that is not covered by other initiatives. Further directions of MobileSenegal and its sustainability are outlined.},

Lockdown started in Jordan and around the globe affecting several aspects of life including economy, education, entertainment, and government policies. Regarding education, the priority was to ensure the safety and progress of the educational process. Thus, new methods of teaching had to be applied using the online learning at Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST), Faculty of Medicine. This study was done to assess (1) Class Experience (2) Students and Lecturers' Interaction (3) Online Learning Advantages \& Disadvantages (4) Students' Preference. Methods A cross sectional study was conducted Convenience sampling technique was used to collect the data from the participants using a survey composed of 18 questions on Google Forms platform. A link was sent to the undergraduate medical students at the Jordan University of Science \& Technology via their e-learning accounts (n~=~3700). The form was available from May 22nd, 2020 to May 30th, 2020 for 8 days long. Data analysis was done using SPSS V 23. Results 2212 out of 3700 students responded, (55.8\%) of them were in the basic years and (44.2\%) of them were in the clinical years. (55.8\%) of students started to take online lectures after 3 weeks. (45.7\%) used the hybrid teaching method (asynchronous and synchronous), (31.4\%) used live classes, and 22.8\% recorded classes. Zoom was the most used platform. (48.7\%) and (57\%) of clinical students and basic students express their interaction as bad, while the others had good and excellent interaction. Maintaining social distance was the most advantage of online teaching, while poor technical setup and no direct contact were the most disadvantage, furthermore inability to have real clinical access was a significant problem for clinical students (p~{$<~$}.001). With reference to students' preferences 75\% of students were not pleased with their experience and 42\% of students prefer to integrate online learning with traditional learning. Conclusion Most medical students at JUST preferred the traditional face-to-face teaching method over the solo online teaching methods with recommendations to convert to a more integrated educational system. Also, a well-established infrastructure should be done in involving online teaching.},

Binary logistic regression was done to analyze factors predicting health issues in students. p~{$<~$}0.05 was considered significant. Results Overall, 1541 medical and 684 nursing students completed the survey from 156 cities. The availability of laptop (p~{$<~$}0.0001), Wi-Fi (p~{$<~$}0.0001), dedicated room (p~{$<~$}0.0001), and computer proficiency was more in students of affluent families and those from cities (p~{$<~$}0.0001). Class duration {$>$}4~h/day (p~{$<~$}0.0001), each class {$>$}40~min (p~{$<~$}0.009) and pre-existing health issues (p~{$<~$}0.0001) predicted the occurrence headache, eyestrain, anxiety, neck/back pain, and sleep disturbance. Power-point presentation was the most widely (80\%) used method of teaching. Only 30\% got adequate time to interact with teachers. Only 20.4\% felt e-learning can replace conventional teaching. Students preferred: 3\textendash 6 classes/day, each class {$<$}40~min, 10\textendash 20~min break between classes and interactive sessions. Conclusion There is a need to improve information and communication infrastructure to enhance feasibility of e-learning for nursing/medical students in India. There should be guidelines (number of classes/day, length of each class, break between classes, curriculum, etc) to improve the retention capacity in students and reduce health issues. Continuous feedback from teachers and students will be required to make e-learning effective.},

  abstract = {Amid the coronavirus outbreak, many countries are facing a dramatic situation in terms of the global economy and human social activities, including education. The shutdown of schools is affecting many students around the world, with face-to-face classes suspended. Many countries facing the disastrous situation imposed class suspension at an early stage of the coronavirus outbreak, and Asia was one of the earliest regions to implement live online learning. Despite previous research on online teaching and learning, students' readiness to participate in the real-time online learning implemented during the coronavirus outbreak is not yet well understood. This study explored several key factors in the research framework related to learning motivation, learning readiness and student's self-efficacy in participating in live online learning during the coronavirus outbreak, taking into account gender differences and differences among sub-degree (SD), undergraduate (UG) and postgraduate (PG) students. Technology readiness was used instead of conventional online/internet self-efficacy to determine students' live online learning readiness. The hypothetical model was validated using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The results revealed no statistically significant differences between males and females. On the other hand, the mean scores for PG students were higher than for UG and SD students based on the post hoc test. We argue that during the coronavirus outbreak, gender differences were reduced because students are forced to learn more initiatively. We also suggest that students studying at a higher education degree level may have higher expectations of their academic achievement and were significantly different in their online learning readiness. This study has important implications for educators in implementing live online learning, particularly for the design of teaching contexts for students from different educational levels. More virtual activities should be considered to enhance the motivation for students undertaking lower-level degrees, and encouragement of student-to-student interactions can be considered.},

It is forecasted to reach an energy-saving efficiency of 65\% with energy use intensity (EUI) of 43 kWh/m(2).yr for the whole building, far below that of 169 kWh/m(2).yr found in Taiwan low/mid-rise office buildings. This building has begun operation in 2011, through actual readings from Building Energy Management System (BEMS) during January to June, first-half-year accumulated EUI of 19.3 kWh/m(2).yr against eQUEST analytical assessment of 22.5 kWh/m(2).yr for the same period. Actual energy consumption analysis for air conditioning, lighting, socket outlet, and power equipment, respectively recorded 41.7\%, 11\%, 22.3\%, and 25\% in June. Demonstrating that eQUEST analytical assessed value is very consistent with building's actual energy consumption readings. The energy consumption standard in the experimental research behind the Magic School of Green Technology stands at world class.}

Net-based learning has become an indispensable tool, and the distance learning system on campus has risen gradually. In order to promote distance learning more effectively, this study attempts to reveal the mentality of teachers, and proposes a willing-of-usage model as a reference for related researchers. Based on the verified TAM (Technology Acceptance Model) model, this study proposed a new model which considers the interface design, the functionality, information literacy, teacher background and organizational support as the external factors. In this study, questionnaires for college teachers around the country are collected on the Internet to understand the will of using distance learning. The data is analyzed using the SPSS and the method of SEM (Structural Equation Modeling). Both reliability and validity are analyzed, and the methodology of factor analysis and path analysis is used to verify the hypothesis and to understand the positive factors that affect the usage of distance learning platform. Structural Equation Models analysis revealed that the paths of the TAM model achieve the significant level, and degree of the model fitness was mostly good. The results showed that the system functionality and interface design only significant affect the degree of ease of use; the organizational support in schools affects the usefulness and ease of use; the information literacy and teacher background only affects usefulness. This study also found that in order to promote the willing of distance learning platform usage, it would be useful if school support such as teaching assistant and career training can be provided.},
