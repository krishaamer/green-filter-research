  abstract = {Nik Storonsky is the Co-Founder and CEO of Revolut, one of the fastest-growing companies in the world with a \$45BN valuation and 50M customers around the world. In July 2024, Revolut posted a whopping \$2.2BN in revenue with \$545M in pre-tax profit in 2023. To date, Nik has raised \$1.8BN for the company from the likes of Index, Balderton, Ribbit, DST and TCV. ----------------------------------------------- Timestamps: (00:00) Intro (00:43) Revolut's Approach to KPI-Based Leadership (01:34) Building \& Hiring Team (05:21) Nik's Leadership (08:22) How Have Nik's Views on Brand Marketing Evolved?

When \& Where Will Revolut IPO: What does Revolut need to do or change before they are ready to go public? When would Nik like for Revolut to go public? When they do go public, where would Nik list? Would it be in London? How does Nik respond to claims that he has moved to Dubai for tax reasons? 2. What Revolut Needs to Achieve to Hit \$100BN: Why has no challenger bank won the US market yet? What will Revolut do differently to allow them to win the US market? What market share will Revolut have in Europe in 3 years time? What line of the business that does not exist today, will be the biggest in 5 years time? 3. How to Build an Execution Machine: Why does Nik believe the biggest mistake he made was hiring senior managers? What have been Nik's biggest lessons on how to hire for roles you have never hired for before? What works? What does not? How does Nik retain insane velocity of execution at scale? How does Nik bucket people into three different buckets? What does each bucket mean for the type of work they do and the expectations placed on them? 4. How Revolut Tests New Products: How does Revolut use a portfolio approach to test new product ideas? How are teams for new ideas structured? What roles do they have? How much time and resources are they given? What is the tracking process to determine the success of new products? What \% of new products do succeed and progress to the core app? Which product did Nik think would be massive but turned out to be a flop? What did Nik not expect to be massive and turned out to be mega hit? 5. The UK and Europe: Are We F******: The Chancellor has said we will have no growth in the UK for the next 3 years. How does it feel for Nik to grow Revolut in this environment? If Nik could advise Keir Starmer on how to turn the UK around, what would he say? Why does Nik believe the US has created so many more \$100BN companies? Why does Nik believe that work/life imbalance is the secret to success and happiness? ----------------------------------------------- Subscribe on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/3j2KMcZ...

  abstract = {The effectiveness of sustainable disposable schemes remains an unsolved issue for policy-makers. This paper investigates the factors that can enhance consumers' ability to dispose of potentially harmful products sustainably. In a field experiment we demonstrate that the physical proximity to a drop-off point enhances the sustainability of consumer disposal of harmful products. We show that the influence of proximity on disposal behaviour is magnified if the consequences of disposal are described using metaphors. An online experiment complements these findings by showing that processing fluency -- the ease to process information - is the mechanism behind this effect. These results provide practical implications for policy-makers and managers who want to enhance sustainable disposal of harmful products, underlying the critical importance of the simplicity of the disposal initiatives and the need to strategically place drop-off bins throughout the city.},

Now, more than ever, we need efficient methods to monitor these changes so we can implement effective conservation strategies to decrease species extinctions. The recent discipline of ecoacoustics emerges with tremendous opportunities but also with big challenges in this endeavor. Species recognition and the separation of different sources of sound (biophony, anthropophony and geophony) becomes central for AI to play a role. Using passive acoustic sensors, along with AI, we can now identify specific animal species by their vocalizations, covering large expanses of territory and extended time frames. This improves not only our understanding of the diversity of life in an ecosystem, but also provides crucial data for conservation efforts and management plans. We will discuss how these tools are being employed in various contexts, from estimating habitat references of threatened species to assessing the diversity of animal communities in tropical forests, and highlight the potential benefits for conservation efforts around the world.

Like other emergencies, as COVID-19 is announced as a pandemic, all countries have started trying to control the situation with technological advancement in the medical sector, educational progress, and in the continuity of productions. As most of the educational institutions have been closed since March and the learning process in higher education has moved online, therefore, developing countries like Bangladesh are also trying to continue classes through the online platform with a lack of technological resources, readiness, and inclusiveness from the perspective of the students. This quantitative study surveyed over 844 students of different universities of Bangladesh to analyze the status of preparedness, participation, and classroom activities through online during the pandemic. The findings revealed a lack of preparedness, participation, and less scope of classroom activities through online learning. Problems of infeasible consistency of the internet and electricity, paying attention, understanding lessons through the online platform are the main constraints of online learning in the developing country. Finding ways of mitigating these problems can be the next subject for further researchers.},

  abstract = {Following the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in China in late December 2019, more than 217 countries became almost immediately infected in the resulting pandemic. Consequently, many of them decided to close their educational institutions as a way of preventing the spread of this virus. For many of them, though, the closure made them unable to deliver learning materials to students owing to their inability to provide the right technology for the purpose. To assist with the digitalizing of learning during this time, this study reviews the most common technologies used in the delivery of learning materials, with the experience of most infected countries being considered. Major challenges in online learning are discussed in this study as well. Further, Saudi Arabia was considered as a case study for the effectiveness of distance learning during the 2020 spring semester, where 300 undergraduate students were surveyed on their opinions of distance learning. The responses to the survey indicated that distance learning was effective in providing the required knowledge to the students during the outbreak of COVID-19. The findings showed that although the lack of interaction and poor internet connections were factors affecting comfortable and successful learning of physics and mathematics, 63\% of students were satisfied with learning management systems, 75\% of students found it easy to understand course materials, and 67\% of students found it easy to understand assignments and could deal with them comfortably. The study findings can encourage educational institutions to digitalize their learning materials in the future.},

Principles for human-AI interaction have been discussed in the human-computer interaction community for over two decades, but more study and innovation are needed in light of advances in AI and the growing uses of AI technologies in human-facing applications. We propose 18 generally applicable design guidelines for human-AI interaction. These guidelines are validated through multiple rounds of evaluation including a user study with 49 design practitioners who tested the guidelines against 20 popular AI-infused products. The results verify the relevance of the guidelines over a spectrum of interaction scenarios and reveal gaps in our knowledge, highlighting opportunities for further research. Based on the evaluations, we believe the set of design guidelines can serve as a resource to practitioners working on the design of applications and features that harness AI technologies, and to researchers interested in the further development of guidelines for human-AI interaction design.},

  abstract = {Bangladesh electricity sector suffers from heavy subsidization of fossil fuels and regulated electricity prices. These interventions distort the fuel mix in electricity production, promote overconsumption of fossil fuels and slow down the low-carbon transition. As a signatory of the 2015 UNFCCC Paris Agreement, Bangladesh has pledged to reduce GHG emissions by 15\% (of which 5\% is unconditional) with respect to Business as Usual by 2030, yet its overall CO2 emissions are increasing. Urgent actions are needed for Bangladesh to fulfil its climate pledge. We use a fit-for-purpose Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model to evaluate the effects of several decarbonisation policies, namely the implementation of carbon taxes and the removal of fossil fuel subsidies and intra-sectoral electricity price distortions. We find that all policies can deliver a win-win situation in terms of macroeconomic variables and CO2 emissions with respect to a benchmark scenario that includes existing price distortions and no carbon taxes. The reduction of 4.6\% in CO2 emissions achieved in the price reform policy experiment indicates that liberalised energy markets can help achieve its Paris Agreement target. Thus, we recommend that the government considers reforming electricity and fossil fuel price structure to foster economic development and environmental sustainability.},

  abstract = {Advanced AI models hold the promise of tremendous benefits for humanity, but society needs to proactively manage the accompanying risks. In this paper, we focus on what we term "frontier AI" models: highly capable foundation models that could possess dangerous capabilities sufficient to pose severe risks to public safety. Frontier AI models pose a distinct regulatory challenge: dangerous capabilities can arise unexpectedly; it is difficult to robustly prevent a deployed model from being misused; and, it is difficult to stop a model's capabilities from proliferating broadly. To address these challenges, at least three building blocks for the regulation of frontier models are needed: (1) standard-setting processes to identify appropriate requirements for frontier AI developers, (2) registration and reporting requirements to provide regulators with visibility into frontier AI development processes, and (3) mechanisms to ensure compliance with safety standards for the development and deployment of frontier AI models. Industry self-regulation is an important first step. However, wider societal discussions and government intervention will be needed to create standards and to ensure compliance with them. We consider several options to this end, including granting enforcement powers to supervisory authorities and licensure regimes for frontier AI models. Finally, we propose an initial set of safety standards. These include conducting pre-deployment risk assessments; external scrutiny of model behavior; using risk assessments to inform deployment decisions; and monitoring and responding to new information about model capabilities and uses post-deployment. We hope this discussion contributes to the broader conversation on how to balance public safety risks and innovation benefits from advances at the frontier of AI development.},

  abstract = {Climate tipping points occur when change in a part of the climate system becomes self-perpetuating beyond a warming threshold, leading to substantial Earth system impacts. Synthesizing paleoclimate, observational, and model-based studies, we provide a revised shortlist of global ``core'' tipping elements and regional ``impact'' tipping elements and their temperature thresholds. Current global warming of {\textasciitilde}1.1{$^\circ$}C above preindustrial temperatures already lies within the lower end of some tipping point uncertainty ranges. Several tipping points may be triggered in the Paris Agreement range of 1.5 to {$<$}2{$^\circ$}C global warming, with many more likely at the 2 to 3{$^\circ$}C of warming expected on current policy trajectories. This strengthens the evidence base for urgent action to mitigate climate change and to develop improved tipping point risk assessment, early warning capability, and adaptation strategies.           ,              Getting tipsy                            Climate tipping points are conditions beyond which changes in a part of the climate system become self-perpetuating. These changes may lead to abrupt, irreversible, and dangerous impacts with serious implications for humanity. Armstrong McKay               et al               . present an updated assessment of the most important climate tipping elements and their potential tipping points, including their temperature thresholds, time scales, and impacts. Their analysis indicates that even global warming of 1{$^\circ$}C, a threshold that we already have passed, puts us at risk by triggering some tipping points. This finding provides a compelling reason to limit additional warming as much as possible. ---HJS                        ,              Global warming greater than 1.5{$^\circ$}C could trigger multiple climate tipping points.           ,                             INTRODUCTION                                Climate tipping points (CTPs) are a source of growing scientific, policy, and public concern. They occur when change in large parts of the climate system---known as tipping elements---become self-perpetuating beyond a warming threshold. Triggering CTPs leads to significant, policy-relevant impacts, including substantial sea level rise from collapsing ice sheets, dieback of biodiverse biomes such as the Amazon rainforest or warm-water corals, and carbon release from thawing permafrost. Nine policy-relevant tipping elements and their CTPs were originally identified by Lenton                 et al                 . (2008). We carry out the first comprehensive reassessment of all suggested tipping elements, their CTPs, and the timescales and impacts of tipping. We also highlight steps to further improve understanding of CTPs, including an expert elicitation, a model intercomparison project, and early warning systems leveraging deep learning and remotely sensed data.                                                        RATIONALE                                Since the original identification of tipping elements there have been substantial advances in scientific understanding from paleoclimate, observational, and model-based studies. Additional tipping elements have been proposed (e.g., parts of the East Antarctic ice sheet) and the status of others (e.g., Arctic summer sea ice) has been questioned. Observations have revealed that parts of the West Antarctic ice sheet may have already passed a tipping point. Potential early warning signals of the Greenland ice sheet, Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, and Amazon rainforest destabilization have been detected. Multiple abrupt shifts have been found in climate models. Recent work has suggested that up to 15 tipping elements are now active (Lenton                 et al                 ., 2019). Hence it is timely to synthesize this new knowledge to provide a revised shortlist of potential tipping elements and their CTP thresholds.                                                        RESULTS               We identify nine global ``core'' tipping elements which contribute substantially to Earth system functioning and seven regional ``impact'' tipping elements which contribute substantially to human welfare or have great value as unique features of the Earth system (see figure). Their estimated CTP thresholds have significant implications for climate policy: Current global warming of {\textasciitilde}1.1{$^\circ$}C above pre-industrial already lies within the lower end of five CTP uncertainty ranges. Six CTPs become likely (with a further four possible) within the Paris Agreement range of 1.5 to {$<$}2{$^\circ$}C warming, including collapse of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, die-off of low-latitude coral reefs, and widespread abrupt permafrost thaw. An additional CTP becomes likely and another three possible at the {\textasciitilde}2.6{$^\circ$}C of warming expected under current policies.                                         CONCLUSION               Our assessment provides strong scientific evidence for urgent action to mitigate climate change. We show that even the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to well below 2{$^\circ$}C and preferably 1.5{$^\circ$}C is not safe as 1.5{$^\circ$}C and above risks crossing multiple tipping points. Crossing these CTPs can generate positive feedbacks that increase the likelihood of crossing other CTPs. Currently the world is heading toward {\textasciitilde}2 to 3{$^\circ$}C of global warming; at best, if all net-zero pledges and nationally determined contributions are implemented it could reach just below 2{$^\circ$}C. This would lower tipping point risks somewhat but would still be dangerous as it could trigger multiple climate tipping points.                                                   The location of climate tipping elements in the cryosphere (blue), biosphere (green), and ocean/atmosphere (orange), and global warming levels at which their tipping points will likely be triggered.                   Pins are colored according to our central global warming threshold estimate being below 2{$^\circ$}C, i.e., within the Paris Agreement range (light orange, circles); between 2 and 4{$^\circ$}C, i.e., accessible with current policies (orange, diamonds); and 4{$^\circ$}C and above (red, triangles).},

  abstract = {This paper investigates how institutional pressures affect the development of Circular Economy (CE) in firms. Using Institutional Entrepreneurship as a theoretical framework, this paper considers three different levels of institutional pressures (coercive, normative, and mimetic) to examine the effect of each pressure and their interactions on the development of CE. Seeking to clarify the debate on the effect of institutional pressures, this paper considers that the main limitation arises from the fact that previous research has analysed the relationship between institutional pressures without considering the interaction between them and the non-linearity of the processes. Deviating from previous papers, our analysis combines regression methods with Machine learning (i.e. Artificial Neural Networks), and employs data from the EU survey on Public Consultation on the Circular Economy. This research finds that while coercive pressures have a compulsory effect on the development of CE, mimetic and normative pressures do not have an effect by themselves, but only in interaction with coercive pressures. Moreover, this paper shows that the application of machine learning tools has an important contribution in solving interaction problems. From the perspective of environmental policy, this means that a comprehensive policy is required, which implies the coexistence or interaction of the three types of pressures.}

  abstract = {Importance               The rapid expansion of virtual health care has caused a surge in patient messages concomitant with more work and burnout among health care professionals. Artificial intelligence (AI) assistants could potentially aid in creating answers to patient questions by drafting responses that could be reviewed by clinicians.                                         Objective               To evaluate the ability of an AI chatbot assistant (ChatGPT), released in November 2022, to provide quality and empathetic responses to patient questions.                                         Design, Setting, and Participants                                In this cross-sectional study, a public and nonidentifiable database of questions from a public social media forum (Reddit's r/AskDocs) was used to randomly draw 195 exchanges from October 2022 where a verified physician responded to a public question. Chatbot responses were generated by entering the original question into a fresh session (without prior questions having been asked in the session) on December 22 and 23, 2022. The original question along with anonymized and randomly ordered physician and chatbot responses were evaluated in triplicate by a team of licensed health care professionals. Evaluators chose ``which response was better'' and judged both ``the quality of information provided'' (                 very poor                 ,                 poor                 ,                 acceptable                 ,                 good                 , or                 very good                 ) and ``the empathy or bedside manner provided'' (                 not empathetic                 ,                 slightly empathetic                 ,                 moderately empathetic                 ,                 empathetic                 , and                 very empathetic                 ). Mean outcomes were ordered on a 1 to 5 scale and compared between chatbot and physicians.                                                        Results                                Of the 195 questions and responses, evaluators preferred chatbot responses to physician responses in 78.6\% (95\% CI, 75.0\%-81.8\%) of the 585 evaluations. Mean (IQR) physician responses were significantly shorter than chatbot responses (52 [17-62] words vs 211 [168-245] words;                 t                 \,=\,25.4;                 P                 \,\&amp;lt;\,.001). Chatbot responses were rated of significantly higher quality than physician responses (                 t                 \,=\,13.3;                 P                 \,\&amp;lt;\,.001). The proportion of responses rated as                 good                 or                 very good                 quality ({$\geq$} 4), for instance, was higher for chatbot than physicians (chatbot: 78.5\%, 95\% CI, 72.3\%-84.1\%; physicians: 22.1\%, 95\% CI, 16.4\%-28.2\%;). This amounted to 3.6 times higher prevalence of                 good                 or                 very good                 quality responses for the chatbot. Chatbot responses were also rated significantly more empathetic than physician responses (                 t                 \,=\,18.9;                 P                 \,\&amp;lt;\,.001). The proportion of responses rated                 empathetic                 or                 very empathetic                 ({$\geq$}4) was higher for chatbot than for physicians (physicians: 4.6\%, 95\% CI, 2.1\%-7.7\%; chatbot: 45.1\%, 95\% CI, 38.5\%-51.8\%; physicians: 4.6\%, 95\% CI, 2.1\%-7.7\%). This amounted to 9.8 times higher prevalence of                 empathetic                 or                 very empathetic                 responses for the chatbot.                                                        Conclusions               In this cross-sectional study, a chatbot generated quality and empathetic responses to patient questions posed in an online forum. Further exploration of this technology is warranted in clinical settings, such as using chatbot to draft responses that physicians could then edit. Randomized trials could assess further if using AI assistants might improve responses, lower clinician burnout, and improve patient outcomes.},

  abstract = {As AI systems become more capable, we would like to enlist their help to supervise other AIs. We experiment with methods for training a harmless AI assistant through self-improvement, without any human labels identifying harmful outputs. The only human oversight is provided through a list of rules or principles, and so we refer to the method as 'Constitutional AI'. The process involves both a supervised learning and a reinforcement learning phase. In the supervised phase we sample from an initial model, then generate self-critiques and revisions, and then finetune the original model on revised responses. In the RL phase, we sample from the finetuned model, use a model to evaluate which of the two samples is better, and then train a preference model from this dataset of AI preferences. We then train with RL using the preference model as the reward signal, i.e. we use 'RL from AI Feedback' (RLAIF). As a result we are able to train a harmless but non-evasive AI assistant that engages with harmful queries by explaining its objections to them. Both the SL and RL methods can leverage chain-of-thought style reasoning to improve the human-judged performance and transparency of AI decision making. These methods make it possible to control AI behavior more precisely and with far fewer human labels.},

  abstract = {The renowned cultural theorist and media designer Anne Balsamo maintains that technology and culture are inseparable; those who engage in technological innovation are designing the cultures of the future. Designing Culture is a call for taking culture seriously in the design and development of innovative technologies. Balsamo contends that the wellspring of technological innovation is the technological imagination, a quality of mind that enables people to think with technology, to transform what is known into what is possible. She describes the technological imagination at work in several multimedia collaborations in which she was involved as a designer or developer. One of these entailed the creation of an interactive documentary for the NGO Forum held in conjunction with the UN World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995. (That documentary is included as a DVD in Designing Culture.) Balsamo also recounts the development of the interactive museum exhibit XFR: Experiments in the Future of Reading, created by the group RED (Research in Experimental Documents) at Xerox PARC. She speculates on what it would mean to cultivate imaginations as ingenious in creating new democratic cultural possibilities as they are in creating new kinds of technologies and digital media. Designing Culture is a manifesto for transforming educational programs and developing learning strategies adequate to the task of inspiring culturally attuned technological imaginations.},

  abstract = {Speculative design is a subsidiary field of critical design practice. It generally involves developing scenarios based on a central object, often a prototype. Because it is concerned with alternative present and future states, many acknowledge the potential of speculative design for raising critical discussion and public engagement on science, technology, and society. In this article, we ask how the analogy of speculative design to thought experiments highlights or problematizes certain aspects of speculative design. Building on the work of Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby, we answer this question through a comparative conceptual analysis of speculative design and thought experimentation as they are understood in their original contexts. We go on to create a theoretical framework applied to four cases: Metamorphism; Walden, a game; The Substitute; and GoatMan. We argue that understanding speculative design by analogy to thought experiments could help design practitioners better achieve the aim of public engagement, enabling a more inclusive and nuanced discussion about the form and style of speculative design.},

  abstract = {Packaging ecodesign can contribute to improve the environmental performance of pharmaceutical products. The main goal of this article is to present an ecodesign approach based on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for pharmaceutical packaging, assessing opportunities to improve the packaging environmental performance, and providing ecodesign recommendations to the pharmaceutical sector. The proposed ecodesign approach consists of five phases. I) The most representative packaging of medicines in the market (blister, bottle, and sachet), with different sizes, materials and weights, were investigated. II) Three ecodesign strategies were selected to analyze with LCA: i) weight and/or volume reduction, ii) alternative types of packaging, and iii) transportation with less environmental impact. III--IV) A cradle-to-gate life cycle model has been implemented, including transport to pharmacies. Alternative transportation modes (truck, train, airplane, and ship) and different packaging production locations have been considered. Thirteen environmental categories have been analyzed. V) Ecodesign recommendations for improving the environmental performance of pharmaceutical packaging are presented in two stages: i) specific recommendations based on LCA, illustrated in sheets with examples of ecodesign, quantifying the environmental impact reduction of an ecodesign solution compared to the original; and ii) generic recommendations for different packaging life cycle phases. Ecodesign recommendations highlight the use of smaller-size packaging, avoiding superfluous elements and empty spaces, which reduces material and production costs, and transportation impacts; the selection of modes of transportation with less environmental impact, considering the packaging production location; and the use of electric vehicles for pharmacy distribution. This ecodesign approach based on LCA allows quantifying environmental impacts robustly to support the incorporation of environmental information from the design, material selection, and packaging production to distribution till the final consumer. This article emphasizes the importance of developing specific packaging ecodesign based on LCA to improve environmental performance and provide more informed recommendations to stakeholders.},

Bastin               et al.               used direct measurements of forest cover to generate a model of forest restoration potential across the globe (see the Perspective by Chazdon and Brancalion). Their spatially explicit maps show how much additional tree cover could exist outside of existing forests and agricultural and urban land. Ecosystems could support an additional 0.9 billion hectares of continuous forest. This would represent a greater than 25\% increase in forested area, including more than 200 gigatonnes of additional carbon at maturity.Such a change has the potential to store an equivalent of 25\% of the current atmospheric carbon pool.

We mapped the global potential tree coverage to show that 4.4 billion hectares of canopy cover could exist under the current climate. Excluding existing trees and agricultural and urban areas, we found that there is room for an extra 0.9 billion hectares of canopy cover, which could store 205 gigatonnes of carbon in areas that would naturally support woodlands and forests. This highlights global tree restoration as one of the most effective carbon drawdown solutions to date. However, climate change will alter this potential tree coverage. We estimate that if we cannot deviate from the current trajectory, the global potential canopy cover may shrink by {\textasciitilde}223 million hectares by 2050, with the vast majority of losses occurring in the tropics. Our results highlight the opportunity of climate change mitigation through global tree restoration but also the urgent need for action.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we show that the evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) and its increased presence within an interactive system pushes designers to rethink the way in which AI and its users interact and to highlight users' feelings towards AI. For novice designers, it is crucial to acknowledge that both the user and artificial intelligence possess decision-making capabilities. Such a process may involve mediation between humans and artificial intelligence. This process should also consider the mutual learning that can occur between the two entities over time. Therefore, we explain how to adapt the Human-Centered Design (HCD) process to give centrality to AI as the user, further empowering the interactive system, and to adapt the interaction design to the actual capabilities, limitations, and potentialities of AI. This is to encourage designers to explore the interactions between AI and humans and focus on the potential user experience. We achieve such centrality by extracting and formalizing a new category of AI requirements. We have provocatively named this extension: ``Intelligence-Centered''. A design workshop with MsC HCI students was carried out as a case study supporting this change of perspective in design.},

  abstract = {The ongoing environmental deterioration is mainly human-induced. In various daily contexts, individuals can make small choices in favor of environmentally sustainable behavior to counteract this effect. With ever-increasing digitalization, these decisions are shifted toward a digital world. Digital nudging presents a promising approach to foster environmentally sustainable behavior without restricting the freedom of choice. However, research on digital nudging appears to be highly fragmented, leaving information systems designers without guidance on which nudging elements to choose in a specific context. By conducting a structured literature review followed by a framework development, this paper provides an information systems design perspective that matches digital nudging elements on context decision types and indicates the effectiveness of their combination. Thus, the provided framework is of practical use for designing effective digital nudging elements. Moreover, it contributes to research by identifying meta-inferences of the current status quo and offering impulses for future research.},

  abstract = {Education for sustainable development (ESD) is promoted as one important component in the endeavor toward sustainable development. Goal 4 in the Sustainable Development Goals (UN in Sustainable development goals---17 goals to transform our world, 2017) in particular targets the role of ESD in this respect. The importance of cultural specificity in ESD is emphasized in numerous international policy documents, but there are few cross-cultural studies that focus on the broad context of sustainable development and ESD. The current study investigates the sustainability consciousness of grade 12 students (age 18--19) in Taiwan (               N               \,=\,617) and Sweden (               N               \,=\,583) and discusses the implications for ESD policy and practice. The findings indicate that significant differences exist between the two samples, both with respect to their sustainability consciousness and within the three sub-constructs of knowingness, attitudes and self-reported behaviors. The differences are considered in light of the cultural value orientations of the East Asian and Western European regions. Implications for ESD are discussed from the perspective of cultural specificity.},

  abstract = {Technological developments have given shape to robotic services which have forayed in the finance and investment industry in the form of Robo-advisors. Robo-advisors are in use in the developed nations since over a decade but have recently entered the developing nations, like India, since early 2015. This research explores the present state of Robo-advisory services in the Indian context and investigates how Robo-advisors can help in mitigating behavioral biases of a retail investor. The present study gives an in-depth understanding about the ability of Robo-advisory to mitigate behavioral biases from the perspective of experts. These experts are from the product development team, quality control team, middleware, or at top management level from BFSI (Banking and Financial Services Industry), IT (Information Technology), FINTECH (Finance Technology) and NBFCs (Non-Banking Finance Companies) in India. The researchers have adopted a qualitative approach, of interviewing these experts, to discover the phenomenon and gain insight about Robo-advisory services. Each interview was recorded and transcribed on word-for-word basis. The transcribed content underwent a structured content analysis, using different categories, resulting from the conducted literature review. The intent is not to generalize the findings, since the field of Robo-advisory is at a nascent stage as far as Indian market is concerned. The key findings indicate that the current focus is to increase awareness level amongst investors, by educating them and by building trust. Our conclusion emphasizes the fact that Robo-advisors still need to mitigate investor's biases while performing risk analysis and profiling the investors. Robo-advisory platforms are not yet comprehensively self-sufficient to accurately perform risk analysis for retail investors.},

  abstract = {AI is undergoing a paradigm shift with the rise of models (e.g., BERT, DALL-E, GPT-3) that are trained on broad data at scale and are adaptable to a wide range of downstream tasks. We call these models foundation models to underscore their critically central yet incomplete character. This report provides a thorough account of the opportunities and risks of foundation models, ranging from their capabilities (e.g., language, vision, robotics, reasoning, human interaction) and technical principles(e.g., model architectures, training procedures, data, systems, security, evaluation, theory) to their applications (e.g., law, healthcare, education) and societal impact (e.g., inequity, misuse, economic and environmental impact, legal and ethical considerations). Though foundation models are based on standard deep learning and transfer learning, their scale results in new emergent capabilities,and their effectiveness across so many tasks incentivizes homogenization. Homogenization provides powerful leverage but demands caution, as the defects of the foundation model are inherited by all the adapted models downstream. Despite the impending widespread deployment of foundation models, we currently lack a clear understanding of how they work, when they fail, and what they are even capable of due to their emergent properties. To tackle these questions, we believe much of the critical research on foundation models will require deep interdisciplinary collaboration commensurate with their fundamentally sociotechnical nature.},

  abstract = {The widespread public deployment of large language models (LLMs) in recent months has prompted a wave of new attention and engagement from advocates, policymakers, and scholars from many fields. This attention is a timely response to the many urgent questions that this technology raises, but it can sometimes miss important considerations. This paper surveys the evidence for eight potentially surprising such points: 1. LLMs predictably get more capable with increasing investment, even without targeted innovation. 2. Many important LLM behaviors emerge unpredictably as a byproduct of increasing investment. 3. LLMs often appear to learn and use representations of the outside world. 4. There are no reliable techniques for steering the behavior of LLMs. 5. Experts are not yet able to interpret the inner workings of LLMs. 6. Human performance on a task isn't an upper bound on LLM performance. 7. LLMs need not express the values of their creators nor the values encoded in web text. 8. Brief interactions with LLMs are often misleading.},

First, we review the evidence that future environmental conditions will be far more dangerous than currently believed. The scale of the threats to the biosphere and all its lifeforms---including humanity---is in fact so great that it is difficult to grasp for even well-informed experts. Second, we ask what political or economic system, or leadership, is prepared to handle the predicted disasters, or even capable of such action. Third, this dire situation places an extraordinary responsibility on scientists to speak out candidly and accurately when engaging with government, business, and the public. We especially draw attention to the lack of appreciation of the enormous challenges to creating a sustainable future. The added stresses to human health, wealth, and well-being will perversely diminish our political capacity to mitigate the erosion of ecosystem services on which society depends. The science underlying these issues is strong, but awareness is weak. Without fully appreciating and broadcasting the scale of the problems and the enormity of the solutions required, society will fail to achieve even modest sustainability goals.},

Members of these communities came together not in praise of the ice cold beverage but, rather, to unite against a common enemy: the Colorado-based Coors Brewing Company. Wielding the consumer boycott as their weapon of choice, activists targeted Coors for allegations of antiunionism, discrimination, and ties to prominent political conservatives. Over multiple decades of organizing and coalition-building, anti-Coors activists molded the boycott tool into a means of political protest. In Brewing a Boycott, Allyson P. Brantley details the history of this boycott movement - one of the longest such campaigns in U.S. history - for the first time. Drawing from an array of archival collections, as well as oral history interviews with long-time boycotters, Brantley offers a compelling, grassroots view of boycotting, anti-corporate organizing, and the unlikely coalitions that formed in opposition to the iconic Rocky Mountain brew. The story of this boycott, as told here, highlights the vibrancy of activism in the final decades of the twentieth century and the enduring legacy of that organizing for communities, consumer activists, and corporations today"--},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers have been developing and refining large language models (LLMs) that exhibit remarkable capabilities across a variety of domains and tasks, challenging our understanding of learning and cognition. The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google's PaLM for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4's performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction. We conclude with reflections on societal influences of the recent technological leap and future research directions.},

Starting from a structural view of how explanations can be constructed, i.e., in terms of an explanandum (what needs to be explained), multiple explanantia (explanations, clues, or parts of information that explain), and a relationship linking explanandum and explanantia, we propose an explanandum-based typology and point to other possible typologies based on how explanantia are presented and how they relate to explanandia. We also highlight two broad and complementary perspectives for defining possible quality criteria for assessing explainability: epistemological and psychological (cognitive). These definition attempts aim to support the three main functions that we believe should attract the interest and further research of XAI scholars: clear inventories, clear verification criteria, and clear validation methods.},

  abstract = {Blockchain implications within the sustainability domain are rapidly arousing the interest of researchers and institutions. However, despite the avalanche of articles, papers, and recently published books, innovation in the blockchain domain is still heavily influenced by light literature, such as news, articles, opinion posts, and white papers. Lacking a homogeneous literature background, case studies often fall into storytelling, providing mere descriptions of the facts according to the writers' impressions and opinions. We therefore investigate blockchain adoption for sustainable purposes through a case study while remaining firmly grounded in three main theoretical literature streams: knowledge management, knowledge infrastructure, and trust. Since blockchain interaction with the real world is managed by oracles, addressing the oracle problem is essential in order to evaluate the effectiveness of blockchain for sustainability issues. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no other paper has efficiently addressed this subject or even mentioned it. Recognizing its scarce consideration in the literature, the oracle problem will be analyzed in both theoretical and practical terms, thereby providing a way to solve the issues related to non-fungible products in the supply chain. Choice over the selected case study was made in light of the divergence in motives for the adoption of blockchain (economic over social), which makes the results more inferable at a broader scale and offers an insight into how sustainable innovations can also be economically viable.},

  abstract = {With the global economy and population growing rapidly, the problems of excessive resource consumption and environmental pollution have become increasingly serious. Thus, the need to promote sustainable development has become more urgent. Sustainable consumption behavior plays a crucial role in achieving sustainable development goals as it can significantly reduce both greenhouse gas emissions and resource consumption. Artificial intelligence technology has broken the limitations of time and space in environmental protection. For example, the Ant Forest leverages the design of ``green energy'' to inspire the public to engage in energy-saving and emission-reducing activities. To examine the impact mechanisms of customers' sustainable consumption behavior, this study applies the stimulus-organism-response theory and the theory of planned behavior. The study conducts regression analysis and bootstrapping methods on a sample consisting of 280 Ant Forest users to explore the influence of artificial intelligence technology stimuli on sustainable consumption behavior and the mediating effects of customer-perceived value and customer stickiness. The results demonstrate a ``linkage effect'' between online green consumption habits and offline sustainable consumption behavior. Moreover, the study finds that passion and usability indirectly promote offline sustainable consumption behavior through customer-perceived value and customer stickiness. Specifically, the influence of customer-perceived emotional value ({$\beta$} = 0.121; {$\beta$} = 0.100) is stronger than that of customer-perceived social value ({$\beta$} = 0.043; {$\beta$} = 0.038). Due to the limitation of the sample size, future research should broaden its scope by incorporating additional variables, specifically customer-specific factors. Furthermore, more advanced research methods, such as big data analysis, should be employed to comprehensively explore the influencing factors of sustainable consumer behavior.},

  abstract = {Significance             The strong focus on species extinctions, a critical aspect of the contemporary pulse of biological extinction, leads to a common misimpression that Earth's biota is not immediately threatened, just slowly entering an episode of major biodiversity loss. This view overlooks the current trends of population declines and extinctions. Using a sample of 27,600 terrestrial vertebrate species, and a more detailed analysis of 177 mammal species, we show the extremely high degree of population decay in vertebrates, even in common ``species of low concern.'' Dwindling population sizes and range shrinkages amount to a massive anthropogenic erosion of biodiversity and of the ecosystem services essential to civilization. This ``biological annihilation'' underlines the seriousness for humanity of Earth's ongoing sixth mass extinction event.           ,              The population extinction pulse we describe here shows, from a quantitative viewpoint, that Earth's sixth mass extinction is more severe than perceived when looking exclusively at species extinctions. Therefore, humanity needs to address anthropogenic population extirpation and decimation immediately. That conclusion is based on analyses of the numbers and degrees of range contraction (indicative of population shrinkage and/or population extinctions according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature) using a sample of 27,600 vertebrate species, and on a more detailed analysis documenting the population extinctions between 1900 and 2015 in 177 mammal species. We find that the rate of population loss in terrestrial vertebrates is extremely high---even in ``species of low concern.'' In our sample, comprising nearly half of known vertebrate species, 32\% (8,851/27,600) are decreasing; that is, they have decreased in population size and range. In the 177 mammals for which we have detailed data, all have lost 30\% or more of their geographic ranges and more than 40\% of the species have experienced severe population declines ({$>$}80\% range shrinkage). Our data indicate that beyond global species extinctions Earth is experiencing a huge episode of population declines and extirpations, which will have negative cascading consequences on ecosystem functioning and services vital to sustaining civilization. We describe this as a ``biological annihilation'' to highlight the current magnitude of Earth's ongoing sixth major extinction event.},

Also in the area of questionnaire design and administration, interaction design is increasingly looked at as an important ingredient of a digital solution. For those reasons, we designed and developed a conversational survey tool to administer questionnaires with a colloquial form through a chat-like Web interface. In this paper, we present the evaluation results of our approach, taking into account both the user point of view -- by assessing user acceptance and preferences in terms of survey compilation experience -- and the survey design perspective -- by investigating the effectiveness of a conversational survey in comparison to a traditional questionnaire. We show that users clearly appreciate the conversational form and prefer it over a traditional approach and that, from a data collection point of view, the conversational method shows the same reliability and a higher response quality with respect to a traditional questionnaire.},

Because of the pandemic of this novel coronavirus in terms of COVID-19, the social life global wide has been changed a lot. To keep the social distance between human being to prevent from being infected is the most important strategy for all the countries. Many dental schools have been locked down to minimize the spread out of this coronavirus infection. Close contact between human being are required for all those learning process in traditional dental education. Learning methods should be innovated to keep on the learning process but away from being infected for dental education during pandemic. The purpose of this manuscript is to exchange the information and experience of those dental educators from different countries to prepare for the future demand for dental education during pandemic. Materials and methods By means of three online symposiums, dental educators from different countries were invited to give presentation and discussion regarding to the information and experience in the innovation of dental education during the pandemic. Results The results showed that the impact of the pandemic of COVID-19 affects the dental education a lot. Intelligent technology has certain benefit for the learning process of dental education during the pandemic. Conclusion The impact of the pandemic of COVID-19 affects dental education a lot. The model of dental education should be innovated to suit different situations and novelty intelligent technology should be applied for future dental education.},

  abstract = {Green transformation has become one of the most important directions in the further development of the world. It involves the development of green technologies and the creation of legal regulations enforcing, for example, saving energy or reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases, as well as any other activities aimed at changing society's attitude towards the acceptance of -- frequently more expensive but more environment-friendly -- technological solutions and legal norms. Thus green transformation can be defined as combining economic growth with caring about the environment in order to guarantee a high quality of life for present and future generations at the level which is attainable due to civilisational development, as well as to an effective and rational use of the available resources. Still, there is no single globally accepted way to this transformation. It is proceeding in a variety of ways and depends on many different factors. The main purpose of the paper is a comparative analysis of the directions of changes occurring in the process of green transformation in EU countries. The added value of the research presented in the paper and its novelty is the analysis of the current patterns of green transformation in EU countries. The paper concentrated on recognizing them and drawing attention to the unfavourable directions of this transformation as well as to its positive aspects. The changes in the process of green transformation were analysed based on data used by the OECD to describe green growth in two periods: 2004 or 2005 as initial data and the last available data (usually 2018 or 2019). For this purpose the TOPSIS method was applied. The EU countries were divided into groups according to their way of applying green transformation. The provided research allows to better understand the course of this transformation in various EU countries.},

  abstract = {GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are the two most widely used large language model (LLM) services. However, when and how these models are updated over time is opaque. Here, we evaluate the March 2023 and June 2023 versions of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on four diverse tasks: 1) solving math problems, 2) answering sensitive/dangerous questions, 3) generating code and 4) visual reasoning. We find that the performance and behavior of both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can vary greatly over time. For example, GPT-4 (March 2023) was very good at identifying prime numbers (accuracy 97.6\%) but GPT-4 (June 2023) was very poor on these same questions (accuracy 2.4\%). Interestingly GPT-3.5 (June 2023) was much better than GPT-3.5 (March 2023) in this task. GPT-4 was less willing to answer sensitive questions in June than in March, and both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 had more formatting mistakes in code generation in June than in March. Overall, our findings shows that the behavior of the same LLM service can change substantially in a relatively short amount of time, highlighting the need for continuous monitoring of LLM quality.},

Although most research on social innovation in Taiwan focuses on problem-solving methods based on the utilitarian perspectives of the public and private sectors, an analytical framework from the societal perspective is proposed in this article. We classify social innovation conducted by the public, private, and civil society sectors as either incremental or radical. This article seeks to provide an overview of the development of social innovation in Taiwan and to answer two main questions. First, how do Taiwan's government and the private sector mainstream incremental social innovation, and what is its influence? Second, how does a radical approach emerge under this influence? This article illustrates how political and social contexts shape the development of social innovation and uses deliberative democracy in practice as a case study to show how radical social innovation emerges and develops.},

  abstract = {本研究之目的，係針對企業推動e-learning模式之概念架構，選擇具有高度涉入障礙的國內醫療產業中已導入e-learning且已達成熟階段的北部某醫學大學及其附屬教學醫院做為個案研究對象並針對同意接受訪談或問卷填答的受訪者進行質性及量化的研究。期能找出影響醫療產業建構e-learning模式的關鍵成功因素，以供目前或未來有意導入e-learning經營模式之決策者作為參考。 本研究採用個案研究法(Case study)。透過文獻蒐集、個案(歷史)資料分析、重點訪談以及半結構式問卷等多重資料來源，進行個案研究。其研究方法分為兩部份，第一部份為質性研究，係針對實際推動數位學習於傳統教學的專責單位主管並具有教師身份之重點人物（Key Person）以及系統廠商等7位進行深度訪談；第二部份為量化研究，針對醫學大學附屬教學醫院中願意接受填答之教師以及具學生身份的不同背景之使用者(含潛在使用者)50位進行立意抽樣的半結構式問卷調查。本研究結果將逐一針對研究問題如下說明： 一、剖析影響建置 e-learning 的主要構面及其影響因素。本研究架構，提出八大構面即「策略」、「課程」、「教材」、「學員特質」、「教學設計」、「文化制度」、「資訊科技與基礎建設」、「成效評估」及綜合文獻歸納出四十項影響因子作為本研究探討醫療產業推動e-learning模式之參考模式且經研究發現具體影響醫療產業建構 e-learning 的關鍵成功因素。 二、探討醫療產業推行e-learning的實際現況以及瞭解醫事人員對e-learning及其相關影響因素的認知及其態度。經調查結果發現：（一）個案使用者的年齡層以31{$\sim$}35歲者居多，是屬年輕化醫院。（二）使用對象以學生身份為多數，主要是五六七年級的實(見)習醫師。（三）平均上網使用人次，每月平均點選率高達十三萬至十七萬人次，表示個案擁有相當活絡的學習社群。（四）使用者每週上網時數為17小時，發現多數使用者每周上網時間均超過24小時，足見使用者的上網經驗相當豐富。（五）每週登入目前服務單位或學校所提供的教學平台之平均學習時數，大多集中在2 - 4小時。（六）使用者最常上網的地點，以在家學習的比例居高，且可遠程使用院內資源，尤見組織提供高度e化的學習環境。（七）絕大多數使用者偏好以傳統面對面教學為主、結合線上教學為輔的混成教學模式，以及同步視訊與非同步互動的混成教學模式來參與線上學習課程。（八）具有使用經驗的受訪者仍是以非同步教學模式者居多，與目前學校端與醫院端實際常用的教學模式相符，顯見醫學教育的教學模式適用以非同步自主與傳統面對面教學混成學習模式來導入線上課程為適用模式。（九）使用者認為最為影響參與學習意願的是電腦技能程度，其次為系統介面的親和力，再次是上網的地點，其次為自主學習方式，接著是時空的便利性，再來是使用電腦的經驗，最後才是授課老師的監督與鼓勵，尤見自主學習的動機下，最大的限制主要仍是與電腦技能程度有關，以及受到系統介面設計與上網地點的便利性等有直接的影響。（十）針對個案有使用經驗的受訪者，曾參與過的線上課程，以PGY課程，大學部課程以及PBeL列居前三名，成為e-learning與實體課程結合最具代表性的應用課程；（十一）使用者認為最須考量教材設計的主要重點為教材難易度，其次是教材的呈現方式，接著是教材的品質，最後才是教材的規格，尤見以教材內容是否符合學習者的需求為最大考量，而對醫療產業而言，則重視課程內容能與臨床實務結合為最能滿足使用者的實際需求。（十二）個案使用者目前最常使用的平台功能以OUR File、上傳檔案以及發表新文章居多，且平台設計也能滿足大多數使用者的需求，足見系統開發初期若能充份掌握師生的實際需求是設計教學平台功能以及營造活絡的學習社群首要的成功基礎，因此強調系統開發應首重需求訪談要明確且掌握組織及使用者的真實需求為原則。 綜上透過研究結果，針對個案的學員特質構面中有關使用者個人基本背景及使用習慣與認知態度等重要的發現，足見研究個案導入e-learning模式已達成熟階段且具備成功關鍵的基礎，實足提供未來決策者有效掌握使用者實際需求為參考，俾以訂定符合組織並兼顧使用者需求的最適決策為目標。 三、最後對有意導入e-learning模式的相關醫療院所或政府單位提出具體建言。},

This study investigates the underlying causes of the de-pegging event through an in- depth analysis of the token economics of the Terra blockchain. Using on-chain data, this study identifies a misalignment in the economic incentive structure of the blockchain protocol as a key contributor to the de-pegging. It is found that an undercompensation of UST when it was redeemed played a significant role in the de-pegging event, with the UST price on cryptocurrency exchanges following the redeemed value of UST that users could obtain by swapping UST for LUNA and selling it on the market. The results highlight the importance of properly designing the incentive structure of blockchain protocols to ensure their sustainability and security.},

In this work, we explore goals defined in terms of (non-expert) human preferences between pairs of trajectory segments. We show that this approach can effectively solve complex RL tasks without access to the reward function, including Atari games and simulated robot locomotion, while providing feedback on less than one percent of our agent's interactions with the environment. This reduces the cost of human oversight far enough that it can be practically applied to state-of-the-art RL systems. To demonstrate the flexibility of our approach, we show that we can successfully train complex novel behaviors with about an hour of human time. These behaviors and environments are considerably more complex than any that have been previously learned from human feedback.},

In her talk, Ilektra introduces the activities of the Thriving Cities team she leads at Circle Economy. The Thriving Cities Initiative is a collaborative programme developed in partnership with Kate Raworth's team (Doughnut Economics Action Lab), C40 Cities network, and Biomimicry 3.8 aiming to help cities to thrive, or else become socially just and environmentally safe places. The programme takes the global concept of the Doughnut and downscales it to the city level, making it a practical tool for transformative action. The pilot projects have taken place in Amsterdam, Philadelphia, and Portland. Would you like to learn how you can downscale the Doughnut to your city?

To paint a picture of the future Mark Zuckerberg is trying to build, so that you can decide for yourself what you think of it. We talked about the Meta's new Orion prototype AR glasses, creating holograms and the Star Trek universal translator, generative AI changing social media, big trends in human connection, open sourced AI, Ray Ban Meta glasses and Quest 3S, the biggest genuine question on his mind right now, and more...

  abstract = {We tackle the task of conditional music generation. We introduce MusicGen, a single Language Model (LM) that operates over several streams of compressed discrete music representation, i.e., tokens. Unlike prior work, MusicGen is comprised of a single-stage transformer LM together with efficient token interleaving patterns, which eliminates the need for cascading several models, e.g., hierarchically or upsampling. Following this approach, we demonstrate how MusicGen can generate high-quality samples, while being conditioned on textual description or melodic features, allowing better controls over the generated output. We conduct extensive empirical evaluation, considering both automatic and human studies, showing the proposed approach is superior to the evaluated baselines on a standard text-to-music benchmark. Through ablation studies, we shed light over the importance of each of the components comprising MusicGen. Music samples, code, and models are available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft.},

We compare the differences over time and in various key situations using a unique experimental framework where participants play a web-based game with real monetary consequences. We observed that accuracy-based explanations of the model in initial phases leads to higher adoption rates. When the performance of the model is immaculate, there is less importance associated with the kind of explanation for adoption. Using more elaborate feature-based or accuracy-based explanations helps substantially in reducing the adoption drop upon model failure. Furthermore, using an autopilot increases adoption significantly. Participants assigned to the AI-labeled advice with explanations were willing to pay more for the advice than the AI-labeled advice with a No-explanation alternative. These results add to the literature on the importance of XAI for algorithmic adoption and trust.},

  abstract = {Today's economies are giving rise to the global 1\% while running down the planet on which all of our lives depend. How, then, should we redesign our economies so that they start to meet the needs of all within the means of the planet? We will speak with Raworth about the concrete steps that should be undertaken by economists, policy makers, companies and consumers, to make our economies fit for the future. Raworth presents `The Doughnut' of social and planetary boundaries as a playfully serious compass for human prosperity in the 21st century, setting out the social foundation below which no one should fall, and the ecological ceiling that humanity should not exceed. If getting into the Doughnut is humanity's 21st century goal, then what kind of policies will it take to get there? According to Raworth, economic policymakers should drop their obsessive focus on GDP growth and instead, aim to create economies that are regenerative and distributive by design. But what will it take to make this happen and where will change begin? Join Kate in discussion on the key ways to think like a 21st century economist. About Kate Raworth Kate Raworth is a renegade economist, passionate about making economics fit for 21st century challenges. She is one of the world's leading thinkers on new economics and presents an answer to one of the most pressing issues of our time. Her internationally acclaimed idea of Doughnut Economics has been widely influential amongst sustainable development thinkers, progressive businesses and political activists, and she has presented it to audiences ranging from the UN General Assembly to the Occupy movement. Her internationally best-selling book, Doughnut Economics: seven ways to think like a 21st century economist (2017) has been translated into over 10 languages.

  abstract = {Abstract             The building and construction sector accounts for around 39\% of global carbon dioxide emissions and remains a hard-to-abate sector. We use a data-driven analysis of global high-level climate action on emissions reduction in the building sector using 256,717 English-language tweets across a 13-year time frame (2009--2021). Using natural language processing and network analysis, we show that public sentiments and emotions on social media are reactive to these climate policy actions. Between 2009--2012, discussions around green building-led emission reduction efforts were highly influential in shaping the online public perceptions of climate action. From 2013 to 2016, communication around low-carbon construction and energy efficiency significantly influenced the online narrative. More significant interactions on net-zero transition, climate tech, circular economy, mass timber housing and climate justice in 2017--2021 shaped the online climate action discourse. We find positive sentiments are more prominent and recurrent and comprise a larger share of the social media conversation. However, we also see a rise in negative sentiment by 30--40\% following popular policy events like the IPCC report launches, the Paris Agreement and the EU Green Deal. With greater online engagement and information diffusion, social and environmental justice topics emerge in the online discourse. Continuing such shifts in online climate discourse is pivotal to a more just and people-centric transition in such hard-to-decarbonise sectors.},

DeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrates remarkable reasoning capabilities. Through RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerges with numerous powerful and intriguing reasoning behaviors. However, it encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates multi-stage training and cold-start data before RL. DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1-1217 on reasoning tasks. To support the research community, we open-source DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models (1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, 70B) distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Qwen and Llama.},

  abstract = {The application of life cycle assessment (LCA) through ecodesign strategies enables making informed choices on the sustainability of products and services. Accordingly, in this work we quantify the environmental impacts associated with the life cycle of an enzymatic multipurpose cleaner to provide guidance on how producers and consumers can boost the implementation of more sustainable production and consumption patterns. LCA methodology with primary data is applied. To enable future comparison, 1 kg of detergent in its container is used as a functional unit, and cradle-to-grave system boundaries are set according to the reference "detergents and cleaning products" Product Category Rules (PCR). The environmental impacts are grouped into upstream, core and downstream life cycle phases, and seven impact categories are analyzed. Regarding the upstream stage, the degreaser 3-butoxy-2-propanol has the larger environmental load in 4 of 7 categories analyzed. During the core stage, electricity, natural gas and road transport of raw materials are the main contributors, while road transport has the largest share in 6 of the 7 downstream impact categories. Considering a cradle-to-grave boundary, a CO2-eq footprint of 0.76 kg per kg of packaged detergent is obtained, where energy consumption and transportation are the main impact drivers. Five ecodesigned scenarios are proposed to lower the overall environmental footprint of the enzymatic cleaner, including the use of renewable energy, higher volume packaging, the use of recycled packaging, the use of renewable surfactants from vegetal origin instead of petrochemically derived ones and the change from road transport for distribution to railway transport are analyzed. Among the proposed new scenarios aimed lower the cradle-to-grave environmental impacts, enlarging packaging volume results the most effective choice, lowering the impacts by 8--38\% (global warming reduction by 25\%). On the contrary, the substitution of the petroleum-based surfactant by one based on palm kernel oil increases the impacts by 4--16\%. Overall, using larger packaging and the adoption of railway transportation are the most effective measures to reduce the impacts. As the followed PCR does not take into account the impacts generated after the use phase, we encourage its extension to the complete life cycle so toxicity and biodegradability aspects can also be considered. Covering from the extraction of raw materials, to production, transport, use and end-of-life, this work may pave the path toward the adoption of responsible production and consumption patterns in the cleaning sector.},

ALA architects delivered the winning entry to the architectural competition held in 2013. In 2014 Ramboll Finland won the structural design contract for the project, taking the project from conceptual architectural design through to completion of construction in 2018. The main structural system is fundamentally a steel frame solution designed to Eurocode. Two EXC4 classified, 109m span, tilted arches carry the two main floors and roof of the building. Post-tensioned cables tie the bases of the arches to provide a tied-arch structure. Other post-tensioned cables in the floor system and concrete cores hold the tilting arches in position. Transverse trusses allow the cantilevering balcony to be delivered. 2400t of steel have been used to deliver the main frame structural solution. With careful and considered design, fabrication and construction, high quality to good tolerances and stringent requirements have been successfully achieved. An overview of the bridge-like structural system that has been conceived and developed for the project shall be presented. Some of the challenges encountered and resolved in the design shall be discussed, as well as an overview of key decisions made to handle project delivery budget and timetable requirements.},

The majority of studies and previous reviews focus on unemployment effects on men. Although these studies are also reviewed, this article highlights studies of (a) the involuntarily unemployed woman, (b) the spouse of the unemployed person, and (c) their children. Within each of these research areas, the authors consider studies grouped according to their methodological strength for drawing causal inferences about the impact of job loss on psychological status, ranging from cross-sectional to longitudinal to prospective studies. The implications of the unemployment literature not only for future research but also for clinical practice are addressed. Knowledge of family effects of this stressful life circumstance is critical to developing effective treatment plans for patients who, although perhaps not the direct victims of job loss themselves, may nevertheless present with problems indirectly caused or exacerbated by unemployment within the family.},

  abstract = {India's education during Covid-19 pandemic has been stand still and will continue to be in a state of confusion until this pandemic stands as a major threat to human lives. During this state of confusion and chaos, it's not only the classroom teachings that will be affected but numerous factors like Organizational routines, Employment rates/Placement rates at various educational institution and other factors are bound to be affected during this pandemic. At present 2 Golden A's of education namely Availability and Accessibility are being disrupted. Nearly, all the Indian educational institutions are going to experience the negative impact of Covid-19 and few revolutionary policies will be required to stabilize this system and the country at large. Likely role of this paper is to bring the impacts and problems to forefront and try providing solutions to those problems which can potentially prove useful for future researches and study.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) is a major tipping element in the climate system and a future collapse would have severe impacts on the climate in the North Atlantic region. In recent years weakening in circulation has been reported, but assessments by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), based on the Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) model simulations suggest that a full collapse is unlikely within the 21st century. Tipping to an undesired state in the climate is, however, a growing concern with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. Predictions based on observations rely on detecting early-warning signals, primarily an increase in variance (loss of resilience) and increased autocorrelation (critical slowing down), which have recently been reported for the AMOC. Here we provide statistical significance and data-driven estimators for the time of tipping. We estimate a collapse of the AMOC to occur around mid-century under the current scenario of future emissions.},

  abstract = {In order to mitigate the impact of the transportation sector on climate change, light and ecological parts must be designed. A lifecycle oriented design methodology with C02 footprint minimization of parts used in various transports is presented in this work. Only material production and use phase are considered in this work, to have a better understanding of the different contributions. Simultaneous topological design and material choice are investigated for 2D examples. The results show that considering out-of-plane thickness as a variable, both problems can now be decoupled for simple load cases. It is shown that a very simple material index depending only on the type of transport can be used. An optimal volume fraction is obtained, specific only to each topology problem, but unrelated to the material chosen or the loads applied. The method is promising for fast ecodesign and its simple implementation enables easy future improvements.},

Today, these trends have reached their extreme--but in the wake of their collapse, we may find great opportunity to transition to a more connected, ecological, and sustainable way of being. This book is about how the money system will have to change--and is already changing--to embody this transition. A broadly integrated synthesis of theory, policy, and practice, Sacred Economics explores avant-garde concepts of the New Economics, including negative-interest currencies, local currencies, resource-based economics, gift economies, and the restoration of the commons. Author Charles Eisenstein also considers the personal dimensions of this transition, speaking to those concerned with "right livelihood" and how to live according to their ideals in a world seemingly ruled by money. Tapping into a rich lineage of conventional and unconventional economic thought, Sacred Economics presents a vision that is original yet commonsense, radical yet gentle, and increasingly relevant as the crises of our civilization deepen"--},

In his twentieth book, John Elkington--dubbed the "Godfather of Sustainability"--explores new forms of capitalism fit for the twenty-first century. If Nassim Nicholas Taleb's "Black Swans" are problems that take us exponentially toward breakdown, then "Green Swans" are solutions that take us exponentially toward breakthrough. The success--and survival--of humanity now depends on how we rein in the first and accelerate the second. Green Swans draws on Elkington's first-hand experience in some of the world's best-known boardrooms and C-suites. Using case studies, real-world examples, and profiles on emergent technologies, Elkington shows how the weirdest "Ugly Ducklings" of today's world may turn into tomorrow's world-saving Green Swans."-- From Amazon},

  abstract = {Food waste is an inefficiency problem that needs to be reduced significantly to achieve a sustainable food system. Best practices and knowledge are available on how to reduce waste but large volumes of food are still wasted every year, so policies that support or enforce broader implementation of best practices are needed. One policy that could be used to push implementation and successful use of best practices to reduce food waste is the Swedish Environmental Code, which states that all actors must consider every possibility to reduce the amount of waste generated in any facility, unless this is unreasonably expensive. However, there is no clear definition on the actual waste reduction needed to comply with this requirement, so it is not enforced in practice. This study explored the potential gains of applying the Environmental Code, potential benchmarking thresholds for illegal levels of food waste and best voluntary practices that can achieve low levels of food waste. The Environmental Code is applicable to most operator food handling systems, and was assessed here using the Swedish public catering sector as a case. All 290 Swedish municipalities were asked to provide raw data for the study and some agreed, resulting in a dataset covering 458 public catering units serving care homes, schools and preschools. The data were analysed to identify different permissible levels of food waste, while the best canteens provided information on their best practices to keep food waste low. The results showed that with best voluntary practice for each type of catering unit, overall food waste would be reduced by up to 76 \%. Best voluntary practices used by the best-performing canteens were identified as: `reusing buffet leftovers', `adjusting recipes based on previous consumption', `advising guests to start with small tasting portions', `setting goals for waste reduction' and `serving smaller volumes in buffet containers and refilling more often'. All these actions can realistically be implemented as standard practices by public catering organisations. The present analysis could not confirm that all these actions have actually been implemented, or to what extent, but practical implementation of identified best voluntary practices meeting stated benchmarks is recommended. The Environmental Code is technology-neutral and goal-oriented and participating food business operators are not forced by law or official regulations to introduce resource-saving measures, but this study shows that some measures can lead to a large reduction in food waste. The study does not show whether harsh, i.e. costly, measures can be enforced on businesses, which can only be determined by case law (court practice). However, in the specific cases in this study, measures that could have been enforced based on the Environmental Code would have led to at least 76 \% reduction in food waste. This would be a major step towards a sustainable food system.},

An outlook on the near future is provided, remarking that mobile marketing and mobile recommender systems can greatly take advantage of being run natively on devices, making it desirable for businesses to invest on designing mobile apps.},

In Taiwan, the goals of environmental and sustainable development have also been specific. In 1997, the Executive Yuan has founded Sustainable Council which is responsible to plan and drive the promotion of the environment and sustainable development. Environment and sustainable development is not only the primary subject of national attention to the world, but is also in harmony with nature, the enjoyment of human health, rich, ideal for achieving equitable and sustainable environment. So far, Taiwan's Ministry of Education has included environmental education issues into ＂National primary and secondary schools nine-year syllabuses＂, expecting that teachers could deepen environmental education in schools and to educate students through the process, issues related to the environment and implemented personally practical act into practice, and finally to produce a positive effect on education as a results.The objective of this study is to investigate the environmental sustainability attitude and the environmental sustainability practice. This study was carried out with a total of 100 college teachers from Taichung, Yunlin and Changhua Counties. The number of returned questionnaires is 85, returned rate is 85\%, the number of invalid questionnaires is 5, the number of effective questionnaires is 80, and the returned rate of effective questionnaires is 80\%, respectively. The statistics analysis was adopted to analyze the collected data and verify the research assumption. The study results showed that the environmental sustainable development attitudes of teachers are positive and aggressive. However, environmental sustainable development practice of teachers achieved moderate and low degree. Moreover, the environmental sustainable development attitude and environmental sustainable development practice performed negative correlation. Finally, a regression model can be established to explain the causal relationship between environmental sustainable development attitude and environmental sustainable development practice. Through this study, the performance of the knowing and doing for environmental sustainable development of the research samples can be understood. Sustainable development is the primary issue around all the worlds. It is that human and nature should coexist harmoniously and achieve the ideal to live without any environmental disaster.},

  abstract = {Plastic pollution and climate change have commonly been treated as two separate issues and sometimes are even seen as competing. Here we present an alternative view that these two issues are fundamentally linked. Primarily, we explore how plastic contributes to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the beginning to the end of its life cycle. Secondly, we show that more extreme weather and floods associated with climate change, will exacerbate the spread of plastic in the natural environment. Finally, both issues occur throughout the marine environment, and we show that ecosystems and species can be particularly vulnerable to both, such as coral reefs that face disease spread through plastic pollution and climate-driven increased global bleaching events. A Web of Science search showed climate change and plastic pollution studies in the ocean are often siloed, with only 0.4\% of the articles examining both stressors simultaneously. We also identified a lack of regional and industry-specific life cycle analysis data for comparisons in relative GHG contributions by materials and products. Overall, we suggest that rather than debate over the relative importance of climate change or marine plastic pollution, a more productive course would be to determine the linking factors between the two and identify solutions to combat both crises.},

  abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) showcase impressive capabilities but encounter challenges like hallucination, outdated knowledge, and non-transparent, untraceable reasoning processes. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution by incorporating knowledge from external databases. This enhances the accuracy and credibility of the generation, particularly for knowledge-intensive tasks, and allows for continuous knowledge updates and integration of domain-specific information. RAG synergistically merges LLMs' intrinsic knowledge with the vast, dynamic repositories of external databases. This comprehensive review paper offers a detailed examination of the progression of RAG paradigms, encompassing the Naive RAG, the Advanced RAG, and the Modular RAG. It meticulously scrutinizes the tripartite foundation of RAG frameworks, which includes the retrieval, the generation and the augmentation techniques. The paper highlights the state-of-the-art technologies embedded in each of these critical components, providing a profound understanding of the advancements in RAG systems. Furthermore, this paper introduces up-to-date evaluation framework and benchmark. At the end, this article delineates the challenges currently faced and points out prospective avenues for research and development.},

  abstract = {Sparse autoencoders provide a promising unsupervised approach for extracting interpretable features from a language model by reconstructing activations from a sparse bottleneck layer. Since language models learn many concepts, autoencoders need to be very large to recover all relevant features. However, studying the properties of autoencoder scaling is difficult due to the need to balance reconstruction and sparsity objectives and the presence of dead latents. We propose using k-sparse autoencoders [Makhzani and Frey, 2013] to directly control sparsity, simplifying tuning and improving the reconstruction-sparsity frontier. Additionally, we find modifications that result in few dead latents, even at the largest scales we tried. Using these techniques, we find clean scaling laws with respect to autoencoder size and sparsity. We also introduce several new metrics for evaluating feature quality based on the recovery of hypothesized features, the explainability of activation patterns, and the sparsity of downstream effects. These metrics all generally improve with autoencoder size. To demonstrate the scalability of our approach, we train a 16 million latent autoencoder on GPT-4 activations for 40 billion tokens. We release training code and autoencoders for open-source models, as well as a visualizer.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The exponential increase in global plastic usage has led to the emergence of nano- and microplastic (NMP) pollution as a pressing environmental issue due to its implications for human and other mammalian health. We have developed methodologies to extract solid materials from human tissue samples by saponification and ultracentrifugation, allowing for highly specific and quantitative analysis of plastics by pyrolysis-gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS). As a benchmark, placenta tissue samples were analyzed using fluorescence microscopy and automated particle count, which demonstrated the presence of \&gt;1-micron particles and fibers, but not nano-sized plastic particles. Analyses of the samples (n\,=\,10) using attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated presence of rayon, polystyrene, polyethylene, and unclassified plastic particles. By contrast, among 62 placenta samples, Py-GC-MS revealed that microplastics were present in all participants' placentae, with concentrations ranging widely from 6.5 to 685\,{\textmu}g NMPs per gram of placental tissue, averaging 126.8\,{\textpm}\,147.5\,{\textmu}g/g (mean{\textpm}SD). Polyethylene was the most prevalent polymer, accounting for 54\% of total NMPs and consistently found in nearly all samples (mean 68.8\,{\textpm}\,93.2\,{\textmu}g/g placenta). Polyvinyl chloride and nylon each represented approximately 10\% of the NMPs by weight, with the remaining 26\% of the composition represented by 9 other polymers. Together, these data demonstrate advancements in the unbiased quantitative resolution of Py-GC-MS applied to the identification and quantification of NMP species at the maternal-fetal interface. This method, paired with clinical metadata, will be pivotal to evaluating potential impacts of NMPs on adverse pregnancy outcomes.},

Here, we assess {$>$}64,000 simulated TCs from the nineteenth century to the end of the twenty-first century for both moderate- and high-emissions scenarios. Results suggest changes to TC trajectories in Southeast Asia, including: (1) poleward shifts in both genesis and peak intensification rates; (2) TC formation and fastest intensification closer to many coastlines; (3) increased likelihoods of TCs moving most slowly over mainland Southeast Asia; and (4) TC tracks persisting longer over land. In the cities of Hai Phong (Vietnam), Yangon (Myanmar), and Bangkok (Thailand), these variations result in future increases in both peak TC intensity and TC duration compared to historical TCs.},

An analysis of observed maximum changes in wind speed for Atlantic TCs from 1971 to 2020 indicates that TC intensification rates have already changed as anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have warmed the planet and oceans. Mean maximum TC intensification rates are up to 28.7\% greater in a modern era (2001--2020) compared to a historical era (1971--1990). In the modern era, it is about as likely for TCs to intensify by at least 50 kts in 24~h, and more likely for TCs to intensify by at least 20 kts within 24~h than it was for TCs to intensify by these amounts in 36~h in the historical era. Finally, the number of TCs that intensify from a Category 1 hurricane (or weaker) into a major hurricane within 36 h has more than doubled in the modern era relative to the historical era. Significance tests suggest that it would have been statistically impossible to observe the number of TCs that intensified in this way during the modern era if rates of intensification had not changed from the historical era.},

Although it has been shown that wetland and some upland trees can emit soil-derived methane at the stem base               3,4               , it has also been suggested that upland trees can serve as a net sink for atmospheric methane               5,6               . Here we examine in situ woody surface methane exchange of upland tropical, temperate and boreal forest trees. We find that methane uptake on woody surfaces, in particular at and above about 2\,m above the forest floor, can dominate the net ecosystem contribution of trees, resulting in a net tree methane sink. Stable carbon isotope measurement of methane in woody surface chamber air and process-level investigations on extracted wood cores are consistent with methanotrophy, suggesting a microbially mediated drawdown of methane on and in tree woody surfaces and tissues. By applying terrestrial laser scanning-derived allometry to quantify global forest tree woody surface area, a preliminary first estimate suggests that trees may contribute 24.6--49.9\,Tg of atmospheric methane uptake globally. Our findings indicate that the climate benefits of tropical and temperate forest protection and reforestation may be greater than previously assumed.},

  abstract = {Speculative Design is an approach that considers alternate futures for technology and society. Through prototyping and/or defining scenarios, important discussions about ethics or the impact of design on the environment and culture can be brought to the forefront of the design process. Sometimes considered alarmist and sensational, it's still a powerful tool for design.  Companies are applying this approach to business strategies or articulating visions for emerging technologies. They are speculating on everything from the future of their products to eliciting communities for input to developing new services. Speculative Design's potential for application is so diverse that it can be used as a lens to consider a more holistic approach to problems and uncover new questions about the future that we may have never asked.  Phil shares several projects from Apple's early vision of the iPad to how governments are using it to design new services today. He also covers some basic framework for how to begin looking at the future and consider all the potential factors and environments that could influence your products or services.

We aimed to challenge conventional policy-making in the European Union and to redefine societal goals across the board, in order to move away from the harmful focus on the sole economic growth -- that is, the growth of GDP -- as the basis of our development model. The conference put into practice the idea of a post-growth future-fit EU that combines social well-being and viable economic development with the respect of planetary boundaries. This three days major event is a cross-party initiative of 20 Members of the European Parliament, supported by a wide-range of partner organisations, which follows the success of the Post-Growth 2018 conference. The conference offered an opportunity for discussion across institutional boundaries and with European citizens. It involved stakeholders from EU and national policymaking, academia, social partners, businesses and civil society organisations.  As it aimed to discuss the future of European citizens, it took place in their house, in the European Parliament (Brussels' site) from the 15th to the 17th May 2023. --- Subscribe to our channel! http://greens.eu/YTsubscribe. 📩 The Greens/EFA is a political group in the European Parliament, made up of Green, Pirates and Independent MEPs as well as MEPs from parties representing stateless nations and disadvantaged minorities.

  abstract = {The current study investigates the efficiency of nudging people to purchase more eco-friendly electronic devices in an emulated online milieu. To this end, participants were presented with three different products (smart phones, monitors and portable speakers) with two different nudges (attraction and default) and a control condition. Results from two experiments show that, while there was already a strong preference to make eco-friendly choices in control conditions, when eco-friendly choices were costlier, there was a clear positive effect of an attraction nudge on participants' eco-friendly preferences. In other words, when product prices were generally high, or when there are large price differences between options, the attraction nudge resulted in a higher probability of eco-friendly choices compared to when no attraction effect is used. The default nudge was less efficient, sometimes producing a negative effect, while its effect was mediated by whether participants endorsed a strong bio-centric worldview, in which case the default nudge promoted more eco-friendly choices. The results are discussed in relation to potential challenges pertaining to deceit and perceived paternalistic intentions with use of nudges.},

  abstract = {A widespread view is that Artificial Intelligence cannot be creative. We tested this assumption by comparing human-generated ideas with those generated by six Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) chatbots: \$alpa.{\textbackslash}!ai\$, \$Copy.{\textbackslash}!ai\$, ChatGPT (versions 3 and 4), \$Studio.{\textbackslash}!ai\$, and YouChat. Humans and a specifically trained AI independently assessed the quality and quantity of ideas. We found no qualitative difference between AI and human-generated creativity, although there are differences in how ideas are generated. Interestingly, 9.4 percent of humans were more creative than the most creative GAI, GPT-4. Our findings suggest that GAIs are valuable assistants in the creative process. Continued research and development of GAI in creative tasks is crucial to fully understand this technology's potential benefits and drawbacks in shaping the future of creativity. Finally, we discuss the question of whether GAIs are capable of being truly creative.},

It is an explorative collaboration between Houdini Sportswear, Albaeco and Mistra Future Fashion with the long-term ambition to create an open-source approach that will provide Houdini and other similar companies with a more holistic view on their sustainability efforts. Albaeco is closely tied to the Stockholm Resilience Centre (SRC), an international research centre for sustainability science at Stockholm University, known among other things for its work on planetary boundaries, resilience and ecosystem services. This report aims to operationalize the Planetary Boundaries framework in a business context. The framework was established in 2009 when a group of scientists (Rockstr{\"o}m and others, 2009) identified nine global environmental boundaries we should remain within so that our societies can continue to develop in a positive way. As such the Planetary Boundaries provide a holistic way of analysing sustainability that has acquired international recognition and contributed to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Rather than a narrow focus on for example water, chemicals or energy use, a planetary boundaries approach implies covering a larger set of critical environmental factors. ...}

Here, we present a novel framework for measuring AI usage patterns across the economy. We leverage a recent privacy-preserving system to analyze over four million Claude.ai conversations through the lens of tasks and occupations in the U.S. Department of Labor's O*NET Database. Our analysis reveals that AI usage primarily concentrates in software development and writing tasks, which together account for nearly half of all total usage. However, usage of AI extends more broadly across the economy, with approximately 36\% of occupations using AI for at least a quarter of their associated tasks. We also analyze how AI is being used for tasks, finding 57\% of usage suggests augmentation of human capabilities (e.g., learning or iterating on an output) while 43\% suggests automation (e.g., fulfilling a request with minimal human involvement). While our data and methods face important limitations and only paint a picture of AI usage on a single platform, they provide an automated, granular approach for tracking AI's evolving role in the economy and identifying leading indicators of future impact as these technologies continue to advance.},

Hansen                 et al.                              (p.               850               ) examined global Landsat data at a 30-meter spatial resolution to characterize forest extent, loss, and gain from 2000 to 2012. Globally, 2.3 million square kilometers of forest were lost during the 12-year study period and 0.8 million square kilometers of new forest were gained. The tropics exhibited both the greatest losses and the greatest gains (through regrowth and plantation), with losses outstripping gains.                        ,              Landsat data reveals details of forest losses and gains across the globe on an annual basis from 2000 to 2012.           ,              Quantification of global forest change has been lacking despite the recognized importance of forest ecosystem services. In this study, Earth observation satellite data were used to map global forest loss (2.3 million square kilometers) and gain (0.8 million square kilometers) from 2000 to 2012 at a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil's well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms. These results depict a globally consistent and locally relevant record of forest change.},

To attain high accuracy on this test, models must possess extensive world knowledge and problem solving ability. We find that while most recent models have near random-chance accuracy, the very largest GPT-3 model improves over random chance by almost 20 percentage points on average. However, on every one of the 57 tasks, the best models still need substantial improvements before they can reach expert-level accuracy. Models also have lopsided performance and frequently do not know when they are wrong. Worse, they still have near-random accuracy on some socially important subjects such as morality and law. By comprehensively evaluating the breadth and depth of a model's academic and professional understanding, our test can be used to analyze models across many tasks and to identify important shortcomings.},

  abstract = {Years ago, I set out to create technology with emotional intelligence, demonstrating the ability to sense, recognize, and respond intelligently to human emotion. At MIT, we designed studies and developed signal processing and machine learning techniques to see what affective insights could be reliably obtained. In this talk I will highlight the most surprising findings during this adventure. These include new insights about the ``true smile of happiness,'' discovering new ways cameras (and your smartphone, even in your handbag) can compute your bio-signals, finding electrical signals on the wrist that reveal insight into deep brain activity, and learning surprising implications of wearable sensing for autism, anxiety, sleep, memory, epilepsy, and more. What is the grand challenge we aim to solve next? About the Speaker Rosalind Picard, ScD, FIEEE is founder and director of the Affective Computing Research Group at the MIT Media Laboratory, co-founder of Affectiva, providing emotional intelligence technology used by 1/3 of the Global Fortune 100, and co-founder and Chief Scientist of Empatica, improving lives with clinical-quality wearable sensors and analytics. Picard is the author of over 250 articles in computer vision, pattern recognition, machine learning, signal processing, affective computing, and human-computer interaction. She is known internationally for her book, Affective Computing, which helped launch the field by that name. Picard holds bachelors in Electrical Engineering (EE) from Georgia Tech and Masters and Doctorate degrees in EE and CS from MIT. Picard's inventions have been twice named to ``top ten'' lists, including the New York Times Magazine's Best Ideas of 2006 for the Social Cue Reader, and 2011's Popular Science Top Ten Inventions for a Mirror that Monitors Vital Signs.}

  abstract = {Information is one of the defining aspects of our era, permeating every facet of our lives. Our ability to extract and effectively utilize information from various processes has the potential for significant advances in our day-to-day lives. Our current understanding of information dates back to Claude Shannon's revolutionary work in 1948, resulting in a general mathematical theory of reliable communication, which formalized modern digital communication and storage principles, paved the way for the Internet, DVDs and iPods of today. Shannon's focus on what is fundamental, and his precise quantitative analyses, continue to motivate and inspire. However, in the current world, information is not merely communicated; it is also acquired, curated, suitably abstracted and represented, aggregated, analyzed, retrieved, inferred, secured, and used in various scientific, engineering, and socio-economic processes. A comprehensive Science of Information that fundamentally builds on Shannon's basic principles, to address key challenges in transforming data to information to knowledge is critically needed. The National Science Foundation has established a flagship Science \& Technology Center on the Science of Information (CSoI) to meet the new challenges posed by the rapid advances in basic and social sciences, economics and commerce, and engineering, coupled with the ability to collect, communicate, and analyze large amounts of data. Its mission is to advance science and technology through a new quantitative understanding of the representation, communication, and processing of information. Led by Purdue, Center member institutions include Berkeley, Bryn Mawr, Howard, MIT, Princeton, Stanford, Texas A\&M, UCSD, UIUC, U. Hawaii. Other institutions (e.g., Rutgers, ETH, and LINCS, Paris) are affiliated with the Center in various roles. In this talk, after briefly reviewing some of Shannon accomplishments, we proceed to explain novel challenges in analyzing multi-modal data, present representative results from our approach in provable security in networks, algorithms for classifying tweets through joint string complexity, and offer some interesting information-theoretic models for biological systems. About the Speaker Wojciech Szpankowski is Saul Rosen Professor of Computer Science and Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University. He received his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Gdansk University of Technology. He held several Visiting Professor/Scholar positions, including Stanford, Hewlett-Packard Labs, INRIA, Ecole Polytechnique, the Newton Institute, Cambridge, UK, and ETH, Zurich. He is a Fellow of IEEE, the Erskine Fellow, and 2010 recipient of the Humboldt Research Award.  His research interests cover analysis of algorithms, information theory, bioinformatics, analytic combinatorics, and stability problems of distributed systems. He published the book ``Average Case Analysis of Algorithms on Sequences'', John Wiley \& Sons, 2001. Szpankowski has been a guest editor and an editor of several technical journals, including ACM Transaction on Algorithms, Algorithmica, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, and Combinatorics, Probability, and Computing. In 2008 he launched the interdisciplinary Institute for Science of Information whose mission is to extend classical information theory to modern settings, including knowledge discovery and information extraction from massive datasets. He is the Director of the NSF Science and Technology Center for Science of Information.}

  abstract = {Recent works have shown how the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be applied to domains beyond natural language processing, such as planning and interaction for robots. These embodied problems require an agent to understand many semantic aspects of the world: the repertoire of skills available, how these skills influence the world, and how changes to the world map back to the language. LLMs planning in embodied environments need to consider not just what skills to do, but also how and when to do them - answers that change over time in response to the agent's own choices. In this work, we investigate to what extent LLMs used in such embodied contexts can reason over sources of feedback provided through natural language, without any additional training. We propose that by leveraging environment feedback, LLMs are able to form an inner monologue that allows them to more richly process and plan in robotic control scenarios. We investigate a variety of sources of feedback, such as success detection, scene description, and human interaction. We find that closed-loop language feedback significantly improves high-level instruction completion on three domains, including simulated and real table top rearrangement tasks and long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks in a kitchen environment in the real world.},

Drawing upon semi-structured interviews with 21 users who used Moments for at least 6 months, then voluntarily discontinued their use of the feature, we discuss the complex dynamics of Moments use, exploring the implicit micro-behavioral process of social media practice. Countering the purported hyper-centrality of WeChat, we identified a periodic loop of ``use, non-use, reuse'' of Moments, suggesting that people suspend their use of Moments periodically to ``re-domesticate'' technology. Through the prism of the domestication approach, we argue that the re-domestication of Moments is a ``reboot'' of the whole process of domestication through four key stages: re-appropriation, re-objectification, re-incorporation, and re-conversion. Re-domestication is a process that allows people to take a retrospective look at their lives and transform Moments from a disruptive app feature into an instrumental apparatus conducive to their personal and professional well-being. By examining this process, we discuss how people use innovative ways to regain their autonomy and agency in their daily interactions with WeChat.},

This study simulates the interior lighting of the International Conference Hall in the Magic School of Green Technology (MSGT) using high efficiency ceramic metal halide lamps that replace the general design luminaires, and PL and fluorescent lamps. We use the secondary reflection of light to reduce glare and improve lighting uniformity. The results show that high efficiency lighting can reduce by 25\% the standard lighting equipment and still provide the same illumination levels. Furthermore, the overall conference hall lighting uniformity increases from 0.59 to 0.78.}

  abstract = {Firms buy renewable energy at premiums and report environmental concerns as motivation to do so. The bulk of the literature on environmental corporate social responsibility suggests that this type of behavior even results in higher profit. However, a product-differentiation framework with perfect competition predicts that renewable energy use has no effect on profit. This paper tests this prediction by investigating the relationship between firms' renewable energy use and profit on the basis of panel data for 920 firms over 2014--2018. We do not find evidence for an impact of renewable energy use on profit. Hence, a `win-win' in the form of higher profit and a better environment does not seem to exist. In addition, the results appear to suggest that firms do not have a positive willingness to pay for renewable energy as contribution to the environment. This implies that firms are only willing to contribute to climate-change mitigation through buying renewable energy when this is aligned with the profit-maximization objective.},

Limited data exists on microplastics within the human reproductive system and their potential consequences on sperm quality. Our objectives were to quantify and characterize the prevalence and composition of microplastics within both canine and human testes and investigate potential associations with the sperm count, and weights of testis and epididymis. Using advanced sensitive pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, we quantified 12 types of microplastics within 47 canine and 23 human testes. Data on reproductive organ weights, and sperm count in dogs were collected. Statistical analyses, including descriptive analysis, correlational analysis, and multivariate linear regression analyses were applied to investigate the association of microplastics with reproductive functions. Our study revealed the presence of microplastics in all canine and human testes, with significant inter-individual variability. Mean total microplastic levels were 122.63\,{\textmu}g/g in dogs and 328.44\,{\textmu}g/g in humans. Both humans and canines exhibit relatively similar proportions of the major polymer types, with PE being dominant. Furthermore, a negative correlation between specific polymers such as PVC and PET and the normalized weight of the testis was observed. These findings highlight the pervasive presence of microplastics in the male reproductive system in both canine and human testes, with potential consequences on male fertility.},

This study evaluates the online teaching of architecture design at the Department of Architecture- Jordan University of Science and Technology, second semester 2019/2020. The study started with organizing a focus group meeting of ten expert participants. Based on the focus group results, a questionnaire survey was prepared. The survey sample included the faculty members and a randomly selected sample of students in design courses and basic design courses. A simple statistical analysis was conducted. The results showed that online teaching during pandemic had been performed regularly in synchronous meetings format. Both faculty and students were satisfied with online teaching in theoretical courses. However, both groups were less satisfied with the design and basic design courses. While students reported technical difficulties, faculty members suffered from a lack of privacy and the extended working hours.},

  abstract = {Children of today have been surrounded by digital technology since their birth. However, children of today are not equally equipped for their technology rich future: various kinds of digital divides still prevail in the society and affect the young generation and their digital futures. Schools and education of children should undergo an extensive digital transformation to be able to meet the needs of the young generation and their digitalized future. The COVID-19 pandemic has suddenly and abruptly forced schools and education indeed to engage in such a transformation. In this study we examine the digital transformation initiated by the COVID-19 pandemic in the basic education of the young generation, the variety of digital divides emerging and reinforced, and the possible barriers reported along the way. We argue that information management research should better acknowledge children, their digitalized everyday life and their basic education as significant areas of concern. We should understand them as well as allow them to shape the education we offer in the context of higher education, but we should also aim at influencing the basic education of the young generation -- for the purpose of equipping them with important skills and competencies for their digital futures but also for the purpose of arousing their interest in this important field, maybe even as a career option.},

The selection of the right market or use of the resulting product is of paramount importance to ensure the final implementation of the solution. With this purpose, this study has undertaken the selection of a market that could absorb the large amounts of by-products generated in breweries, the optimization of the logistics for the collection of by-products, and the ecodesign of a valorisation process and the facility needed to set up the entire value chain. This analysis has resulted in the ecodesign of a valorisation process of brewery's side streams aiming at the production of ingredients for the formulation of aquaculture feeds. Life Cycle Assessment has been used to find an efficient and sustainable processing scheme and to ecodesign a Model Recovery Plant that uses the brewery's by-product as second-generation feedstuff to produce ingredients for aquafeed. The overall ecodesign of the new circular economy scheme for Brewer's side streams reached a reduction of the environmental footprint of 6\% in the resulting aquafeed products that account for the biggest part of the aquaculture footprint.},

  abstract = {Summary             We analyze the environmental impact of household consumption in terms of the material, water, and land-use requirements, as well as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, associated with the production and use of products and services consumed by these households. Using the new EXIOBASE 2.2 multiregional input-output database, which describes the world economy at the detail of 43 countries, five rest-of-the-world regions, and 200 product sectors, we are able to trace the origin of the products consumed by households and represent global supply chains for 2007. We highlight the importance of environmental pressure arising from households with their consumption contributing to more than 60\% of global GHG emissions and between 50\% and 80\% of total land, material, and water use. The footprints are unevenly distributed across regions, with wealthier countries generating the most significant impacts per capita. Elasticities suggest a robust and significant relationship between households' expenditure and their environmental impacts, driven by a rising demand of nonprimary consumption items. Mobility, shelter, and food are the most important consumption categories across the environmental footprints. Globally, food accounts for 48\% and 70\% of household impacts on land and water resources, respectively, with consumption of meat, dairy, and processed food rising fast with income. Shelter and mobility stand out with high carbon and material intensity, whereas the significance of services for footprints relates to the large amount of household expenditure associated with them.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background.               Around two-thirds of global GHG emissions are directly and indirectly linked to household consumption, with a global average of about 6 tCO               2               eq/cap. The average per capita carbon footprint of North America and Europe amount to 13.4 and 7.5 tCO               2               eq/cap, respectively, while that of Africa and the Middle East---to 1.7 tCO               2               eq/cap on average. Changes in consumption patterns to low-carbon alternatives therefore present a great and urgently required potential for emission reductions. In this paper, we synthesize emission mitigation potentials across the consumption domains of food, housing, transport and other consumption.               Methods.               We systematically screened 6990 records in the Web of Science Core Collections and Scopus. Searches were restricted to (1) reviews of lifecycle assessment studies and (2) multiregional input-output studies of household consumption, published after 2011 in English. We selected against pre-determined eligibility criteria and quantitatively synthesized findings from 53 studies in a meta-review. We identified 771 original options, which we summarized and presented in 61 consumption options with a positive mitigation potential. We used a fixed-effects model to explore the role of contextual factors (geographical, technical and socio-demographic factors) for the outcome variable (mitigation potential per capita) within consumption options.               Results and discussion.               We establish consumption options with a high mitigation potential measured in tons of CO               2               eq/capita/yr. For transport, the options with the highest mitigation potential include living car-free, shifting to a battery electric vehicle, and reducing flying by a long return flight with a median reduction potential of more than 1.7 tCO               2               eq/cap. In the context of food, the highest carbon savings come from dietary changes, particularly an adoption of vegan diet with an average and median mitigation potential of 0.9 and 0.8 tCO               2               eq/cap, respectively. Shifting to renewable electricity and refurbishment and renovation are the options with the highest mitigation potential in the housing domain, with medians at 1.6 and 0.9 tCO               2               eq/cap, respectively. We find that the top ten consumption options together yield an average mitigation potential of 9.2 tCO               2               eq/cap, indicating substantial contributions towards achieving the 1.5 {$^\circ$}C--2 {$^\circ$}C target, particularly in high-income context.},

We expect that the convincing performance of ChatGPT incentivizes users to apply it to a variety of downstream tasks, including prompting the model to simplify their own medical reports. To investigate this phenomenon, we conducted an exploratory case study. In a questionnaire, we asked 15 radiologists to assess the quality of radiology reports simplified by ChatGPT. Most radiologists agreed that the simplified reports were factually correct, complete, and not potentially harmful to the patient. Nevertheless, instances of incorrect statements, missed key medical findings, and potentially harmful passages were reported. While further studies are needed, the initial insights of this study indicate a great potential in using large language models like ChatGPT to improve patient-centered care in radiology and other medical domains.},

In an attempt to understand and propose solutions to this challenge, the authors of this paper set out to: test an innovative combination of methods to generate and evaluate ideas and strategies; and to write about the findings using collaborative online methods. During this process universities in the UK moved to online working and so the authors completed this paper through entirely online means. The authors - a team of academic researchers from the University of AAA - came together in sessions designed as a hybrid of World Caf{\'e} and Delphi technique approaches to discuss challenges and solutions. The findings were written up drawing on insights from the use of massively authored papers (also known as `massively open online papers', MOOPs), and online tools to enable remote collaboration. Expert consensus was sought in this project within a group of participants (N~\hspace{0pt}=~\hspace{0pt}7) in one university setting to create a MOOP. This paper presents details of the process, the findings, and reflections on this collaborative and cooperative exercise. That this paper was written using the methods discussed within it, highlights the value and success of the approach. In light of the current Coronavirus pandemic and the increased need to work remotely, this paper offers academics useful strategies for meaningful and productive online collaboration.},

The Climate Change and Country Success (C               3               S) and Climate Change and Cities' Quality of Life (C               3               QL) models and maps of the world created as part of this research showed that as economic, social, political, cultural, and environmental metrics of countries and cities improve, so do their climate change indicators. For the 14 climate change indicators, the C               3               S and C               3               QL models indicated 68.8\% average dispersion dimensions in the case of countries and 52.8\% in the case of cities. Our research showed that increases in the success of 169 countries saw improvements in 9 climate change indicators out of the 12 considered. Improvements in country success indicators were accompanied by a 71\% improvement in climate change metrics.},

An online survey was conducted from 1 May to 8 May 2020 to collect the information. A structural questionnaire link using `Google form' was sent to students' through WhatsApp and E-mail. A total of 232 students provided complete information regarding the survey. The simple percentage distribution was used to assess the learning status of the study participants. During the lockdown period, around 70\% of learners were involved in e-learning. Most of the learners were used android mobile for attending e-learning. Students have been facing various problems related to depression anxiety, poor internet connectivity, and unfavorable study environment at home. Students from remote areas and marginalized sections mainly face enormous challenges for the study during this pandemic. This study suggests targeted interventions to create a positive space for study among students from the vulnerable section of society. Strategies are urgently needed to build a resilient education system in the state that will ensure to develop the skill for employability and the productivity of the young minds.},

The loss scales as a power-law with model size, dataset size, and the amount of compute used for training, with some trends spanning more than seven orders of magnitude. Other architectural details such as network width or depth have minimal effects within a wide range. Simple equations govern the dependence of overfitting on model/dataset size and the dependence of training speed on model size. These relationships allow us to determine the optimal allocation of a fixed compute budget. Larger models are significantly more sample-efficient, such that optimally compute-efficient training involves training very large models on a relatively modest amount of data and stopping significantly before convergence.},

The study utilized the ZMET technique and focus groups. A total of 28 heavy users of luxury brands were interviewed. Results indicate that luxury brands are chiefly defined by such constructs as price, quality and aesthetical attributes, whereas ethicality is centrally demarcated by human wellbeing, the environment and animal welfare, amongst other elements. The fusion of these two concepts implies several encouraging outlooks and certain deterring factors. Results denote that there is potential for ethical luxury's inception in the Taiwanese market, but with considerable forethought in the process. This study extends the body of knowledge in how consumers perceive the prospect of ethical luxury, especially from a non-western perspective.},

  abstract = {Chatbots enable organizations in the business-to-customer domain to respond to repetitive requests efficiently. Extant approaches in Natural Language Processing (NLP) already address the essential requirement of understanding user input and synthesizing a response as close as possible to a response a human interlocutor would give. However, we argue that the organizational adoption of chatbots further depends on the underlying model's capability to learn and comply with organizations' business processes, for example, authenticating a customer before providing sensitive details. To address this issue, we develop an approach that quantifies chatbots' ability to learn business processes using standardized process mining metrics. We demonstrate our approach by training chatbots on a dataset of more than 500,000 customer service conversations from three companies on Twitter and show how our approach supports the quantification of a chatbot's overall ability to learn business processes from the training data. Furthermore, we quantify a chatbot's ability to learn a particular variant of the underlying process and we show how to compare the chatbot's executed steps against a given normative process model. Our approach that seamlessly integrates with existing approaches to evaluate NLP-based chatbots mitigates the current hurdles that practitioners face and, therefore, strives to foster the adoption of chatbots in practice.},

  abstract = {Prudent risk management requires consideration of bad-to-worst-case scenarios. Yet, for climate change, such potential futures are poorly understood. Could anthropogenic climate change result in worldwide societal collapse or even eventual human extinction? At present, this is a dangerously underexplored topic. Yet there are ample reasons to suspect that climate change could result in a global catastrophe. Analyzing the mechanisms for these extreme consequences could help galvanize action, improve resilience, and inform policy, including emergency responses. We outline current knowledge about the likelihood of extreme climate change, discuss why understanding bad-to-worst cases is vital, articulate reasons for concern about catastrophic outcomes, define key terms, and put forward a research agenda. The proposed agenda covers four main questions: 1) What is the potential for climate change to drive mass extinction events? 2) What are the mechanisms that could result in human mass mortality and morbidity? 3) What are human societies' vulnerabilities to climate-triggered risk cascades, such as from conflict, political instability, and systemic financial risk? 4) How can these multiple strands of evidence---together with other global dangers---be usefully synthesized into an ``integrated catastrophe assessment''? It is time for the scientific community to grapple with the challenge of better understanding catastrophic climate change.},

Thus far, the integrated assessment modelling community and the IPCC have neglected to consider degrowth scenarios, where economic output declines due to stringent climate mitigation. Hence, their potential to avoid reliance on negative emissions and speculative rates of technological change remains unexplored. As a first step to address this gap, this paper compares 1.5\,\,{$^\circ$}C degrowth scenarios with IPCC archetype scenarios, using a simplified quantitative representation of the fuel-energy-emissions nexus. Here we find that the degrowth scenarios minimize many key risks for feasibility and sustainability compared to technology-driven pathways, such as the reliance on high energy-GDP decoupling, large-scale carbon dioxide removal and large-scale and high-speed renewable energy transformation. However, substantial challenges remain regarding political feasibility. Nevertheless, degrowth pathways should be thoroughly considered.},

Solar chimney is an excellent passive ventilation system which relies on natural driving force, that is, the energy from the sun. A significant amount of research work has been done on solar chimney since the 1990s. This article presents an overview of solar chimney research that has taken place in the last two decades. The review focuses on two main areas of research -- the effects of geometry and inclination angle on the ventilation performance of a solar chimney. The experimental investigations of solar chimney have dominated the existing literature. However, numerical modelling of solar chimney using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique has attracted increasing attention. Moreover, this review found that solar chimney as a passive ventilation strategy has not been fully understood.}

  abstract = {The research paper reports insights into the primary class teachers' experiences and inclusive methodologies in India during virtual class sessions. Teaching online during the COVID pandemic has turned out to be an adaptive and transformative challenge for teachers. Though Indian teachers are used to the chalk-and-talk method, an online setup has compelled them to discover innovative strategies to maintain an inclusive classroom. It was found that teachers are using puppetry, storytelling, energizers, ice-breakers in their sessions to make it engaging. An in-depth study was undertaken to understand the experiences of five primary class teachers from private schools in India. Data thus collected were analyzed qualitatively. The study results demonstrated that the teachers had improved professionally--- they have become independent in using the internet and exploring new ways of teaching them per their needs. Nevertheless, it was also found that the schools lack support, fear among the teachers of being asked to quit the job, blocking students from the online class if they fail to pay the fees, and exorbitant salary cuts. The challenges related to young students were - lack of proper resources for online sessions, low attention span, technical distractions, lack of physical development, excessive interference of the parents and lack of socialization. The paper concludes with policy proposals regarding standardized online education platforms and provisions for proper resources for virtual class sessions to marginalized families to minimize India's digital divide.},

  abstract = {In the present article, we explore how sustainable development strategies and health promotion strategies can be bridged. The concept of the `duality of structure' is taken as our starting point for understanding the linkages between health promotion and sustainable development, and for uncovering the structural properties or conditions which either enable or constrain sustainable public health initiatives. We argue that strategies towards health promotion are not sufficiently integrated with strategies for sustainable development, and thus political strategies aimed at solving health problems or sustainability problems may cause new, undesired and unforeseen environmental or health problems. First, we explore how the relation between health and sustainability is articulated in international policy documents. Next, we develop a model for understanding the relation between health promotion and sustainability. Third, we use examples from agriculture and food production to illustrate that health and sustainability are mutually enabling and constraining. We conclude that while the renewed focus on food security and food inequalities has brought the health and sustainability dimensions of the food system onto the political agenda, the conceptualization of duality between health and sustainability could be a new platform for a critical and theoretical stance towards the market-oriented food system strategy. Thinking along the lines of duality means that the integration of health promotion strategies and sustainable development strategies cannot be based on an approach to integration in which either health or sustainability is given precedence over the other. From a duality perspective, integration means conceiving sustainability from a health perspective and health from a sustainability perspective.}

In this paper, we review the history of the Winograd Schema Challenge and discuss the lasting contributions of the flurry of research that has taken place on the WSC in the last decade.

  abstract = {This study aims to provide information about circular economy perspectives in the management of textile products and textile waste in the European Union (EU). The report improves the understanding of current value chains in the manufacturing and retailing of apparel products in the EU and provides a detailed picture of material flows in the EU textile sector in a global context. This includes an overview of the size of the textile processing industry in the EU in terms of turnover, employment, number and size of companies, and the EU's share of the global industry. Then, an accurate picture is drawn of the volume (tonnes) and value (Euros) of new fibres, yarns, fabrics and textile products (apparel and household textiles) produced in the EU and traded with the rest of the world. This is complemented by a detailed look at the volumes of post consumer textiles available for collection, reuse and recycling in EU countries, based on available data. This mapping serves as a preview of the upcoming challenges associated with the increased collection and processing of post-consumer textiles, foreseen as a result of mandatory obligations for the separate collection of textile waste in 2025. Furthermore, it identifies needs for planning the new fibre-to-fibre recycling capacity. This study also provides information on current industrial practice in the EU for the collection, sorting and preparation of post-consumer textiles for reuse and recycling. Both currently installed and emerging technologies for the recycling of textile fabrics and apparel are mapped in order to provide a snapshot of the state of the art of available technologies that are expected to cope with the increased amount of textile waste towards 2025. The study details existing capacities for the collection and sorting of old textiles in Europe, and describes recycling technologies that are at a relatively high technological maturity level in order to estimate future sorting and recycling capacities. In order to minimise overlaps with an ongoing study commissioned by DG GROW about textile recycling technologies, the review of recycling technologies in this study mainly focuses on the core principles of each technology type and provides examples of that technology type in operation. On this basis, the challenges that exist with regard to the sorting and recycling technologies in terms of achieving a more circular economy will be addressed. With regard to the perspectives of the circular economy in the textile sector, the study collects and examines established and newly emerging circular business models that have the potential to make the value chain for the European textile and clothing market and the post-consumer textiles sector more circular. Knowledge on existing and emerging practices of repair, reuse and recycling of textile products is presented and analysed with a view to ascertaining how these activities can contribute to increasing the circular economy in the EU. This provides a basis for identifying which options show the greatest potential, and for understanding which policy interventions, if any, could help shift the textile sector towards increased circularity. The study concludes with an analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) of the textiles production and consumption system in two scenarios: 1) the prevalence of a linear economy model and 2) a projected circular economy scenario. On this basis, the opportunities for and threats to the current textile sector, including the post-consumer textile collection, sorting, reuse and recycling industries, are examined in their entirety. Existing and emerging circular economy models are analysed in the same way},

  abstract = {Existing research offers a nuanced understanding of the conditions under which firms can gain a competitive advantage through environmental business conduct. However, we know quite little about whether such action can also generate benefits for firms induced by political action, such as benefits associated with public procurement, (softer) regulatory enforcement and corporate tax breaks. We argue that citizens are more likely to support such rewards for firms that have a stronger record of environmental business conduct, express stronger commitment to future environmental action and submit such action to independent audits. The empirical analysis focuses on vehicle emissions reduction by car producers and plastic waste reduction by retailers. Choice experiments with 6726 respondents from Germany and the United States support these arguments. Our findings are surprisingly consistent across two different sociocultural and political contexts (Germany, USA), two different environmental policy domains (vehicle emissions, plastic waste) and three forms of political rewards. Whereas studies focusing on narrowly defined economic benefits (competitiveness) of environmental business conduct have become somewhat more sceptical about the magnitude and scope of such benefits, our results provide more room for optimism by pointing to other types of benefits of corporate environmental action.},

  abstract = {We tackle the problem of generating audio samples conditioned on descriptive text captions. In this work, we propose AaudioGen, an auto-regressive generative model that generates audio samples conditioned on text inputs. AudioGen operates on a learnt discrete audio representation. The task of text-to-audio generation poses multiple challenges. Due to the way audio travels through a medium, differentiating ``objects'' can be a difficult task (e.g., separating multiple people simultaneously speaking). This is further complicated by real-world recording conditions (e.g., background noise, reverberation, etc.). Scarce text annotations impose another constraint, limiting the ability to scale models. Finally, modeling high-fidelity audio requires encoding audio at high sampling rate, leading to extremely long sequences. To alleviate the aforementioned challenges we propose an augmentation technique that mixes different audio samples, driving the model to internally learn to separate multiple sources. We curated 10 datasets containing different types of audio and text annotations to handle the scarcity of text-audio data points. For faster inference, we explore the use of multi-stream modeling, allowing the use of shorter sequences while maintaining a similar bitrate and perceptual quality. We apply classifier-free guidance to improve adherence to text. Comparing to the evaluated baselines, AudioGen outperforms over both objective and subjective metrics. Finally, we explore the ability of the proposed method to generate audio continuation conditionally and unconditionally. Samples: https://felixkreuk.github.io/audiogen},

  abstract = {Although large language models (LLMs) have been touted for their ability to generate natural-sounding text, there are growing concerns around possible negative effects of LLMs such as data memorization, bias, and inappropriate language. Unfortunately, the complexity and generation capacities of LLMs make validating (and correcting) such concerns difficult. In this work, we introduce ReLM, a system for validating and querying LLMs using standard regular expressions. ReLM formalizes and enables a broad range of language model evaluations, reducing complex evaluation rules to simple regular expression queries. Our results exploring queries surrounding memorization, gender bias, toxicity, and language understanding show that ReLM achieves up to 15x higher system efficiency, 2.5x data efficiency, and increased statistical and prompt-tuning coverage compared to state-of-the-art ad-hoc queries. ReLM offers a competitive and general baseline for the increasingly important problem of LLM validation.},

We find that sustainability strategies, as well as an environmental focus, were more important than other fund characteristics. Moreover, negative affect in relation to SRI contributed as an observable factor to explain variance heterogeneity while experience in fund savings, positive product involvement as well as positive affect were not significant. Our main finding is, however, that latent behavioral characteristics of the investors are strong predictors of latent class membership thereby contributing to distinguish nontrivial investor sub-groups. We find no support for the contribution of sociodemographic characteristics. These results can serve to identify market segments so that equity fund offerings, including those related to SRI, can be mobilized, optimized and tailored to meet the demand for SRI among private investors.},

  abstract = {The petrochemical industry must transition into a circular carbo-chemical industry to respond to three main challenges: shifting hydrocarbon stock, climate change and circular economy.           ,                             The petrochemical industry grew to become one of the world's largest industries during the 20th century. It is expected that it will continue to grow, as the world's population gets wealthier, social dynamics change and people demand more affordable and useful materials. The industry recognises that the Earth's carrying capacity is limited. It is adapting to seek to become a truly sustainable `carbo'-chemical industry. This paper will address the three main challenges of this transition: shifting hydrocarbon stock, climate change and circular economy. As the energy sector transitions from oil, coal and eventually natural gas, it is expected that the chemical industry will have access to abundant hydrocarbon stocks for which it can find valuable uses. But rising CO               2               prices and increasing upgrading costs will likely encourage greater use of alternative, low-carbon feedstocks. In particular, there may be a development of biomass for manufacturing oxygenated chemical intermediates and bio-based materials. To help tackle climate change, the industry will need to reduce the CO               2               emissions of its processes and utilities (energy sources). Ways to achieve this will include efficiency improvements, electrification of utilities and processes and switching to renewable H               2               ; upgrading by-products to chemicals; and CO               2               capture and storage or utilisation (CCS/CCU). The issue of plastic waste pollution is combining with the challenges discussed above to push society and governments towards a more circular economy. Customer demand for sustainable products is growing. New regulations (and technologies) are being rolled out for waste collection, sorting and recycling. In addition, the industry is making pledges to produce and use more sustainably. However, it is expected that fresh carbon will still have to enter the material cycle. It will be needed to feed the growth of the chemical industry and to compensate for inevitable recycling losses. For a truly circular industry, this fresh carbon would come from a renewable source,               i.e.               from atmospheric CO               2               , initially               via               biomass and later possibly from direct CO               2               capture and utilisation (CCU).},

  abstract = {The shift to distance teaching and learning during the COVID-19 pandemic brought about a real challenge for both instructors and students. To face these difficulties in teaching undergraduate Chemistry courses at the University of Santo Tomas, a blended learning strategy in the context of teaching and learning of Physical Chemistry 1 and Analytical Chemistry for Chemical Engineering students were employed. Here, we present an online strategy that facilitated the transition from traditional face-to-face learning to full online instruction. This is a five-component blended learning strategy referred to as Discover, Learn, Practice, Collaborate and Assess (DLPCA). In DLPCA, the asynchronous part of the teaching was achieved through broadcast of pre-recorded lecture videos on YouTube to allow students to study and progress with learning at their own pace. The synchronous part of the teaching was conducted using video conferencing platforms, such as Zoom or Google Meet. The DLPCA strategy was presented and discussed to the students prior to its implementation. The analysis of the teaching and learning experience based on three indicators (i) student's learning experience, (ii) student's academic performance and (iii) instructor observations showed that DLPCA had a positive impact on students and instructors. The identified challenges were stability of internet connection and instructor's familiarity with readily available internet-based teaching tools, such as video conferencing software. Instructors must also find means to improve their interaction with students and maintain student interest and engagement during online classes. The survey also indicated that most of the students are satisfied with the DLCPA strategy. Hence, this strategy is considered a manageable and effective alternative that can be adapted to full online instruction to other undergraduate Chemistry lecture courses. Overall, the findings and insights in this study will add valuable resources for further hybrid instruction in the post-COVID-19 time in higher education.},

  abstract = {Approximately 2.5 {\texttimes} 10               6               square kilometers of the Amazon forest are currently degraded by fire, edge effects, timber extraction, and/or extreme drought, representing 38\% of all remaining forests in the region. Carbon emissions from this degradation total up to 0.2 petagrams of carbon per year (Pg C year               -1               ), which is equivalent to, if not greater than, the emissions from Amazon deforestation (0.06 to 0.21 Pg C year               -1               ). Amazon forest degradation can reduce dry-season evapotranspiration by up to 34\% and cause as much biodiversity loss as deforestation in human-modified landscapes, generating uneven socioeconomic burdens, mainly to forest dwellers. Projections indicate that degradation will remain a dominant source of carbon emissions independent of deforestation rates. Policies to tackle degradation should be integrated with efforts to curb deforestation and complemented with innovative measures addressing the disturbances that degrade the Amazon forest.                        ,              Losing the Amazon                            The Amazon rainforest is a biodiversity hotspot under threat from ongoing land conversion and climate change.

Albert               et al               . reviewed the drivers of change in the Amazon and show that anthropogenic changes are occurring much faster than naturally occurring environmental changes of the past. Although deforestation has been widely documented in the Amazon, degradation is also having major impacts on biodiversity and carbon storage. Lapola               et al               . synthesized the drivers and outcomes of Amazon forest degradation from timber extraction and habitat fragmentation, fires, and drought. ---BEL                        ,              Two Reviews spotlight the threats of ongoing deforestation and degradation in the Amazon.           ,                             BACKGROUND               Most analyses of land-use and land-cover change in the Amazon forest have focused on the causes and effects of deforestation. However, anthropogenic disturbances cause degradation of the remaining Amazon forest and threaten their future. Among such disturbances, the most important are edge effects (due to deforestation and the resulting habitat fragmentation), timber extraction, fire, and extreme droughts that have been intensified by human-induced climate change. We synthesize knowledge on these disturbances that lead to Amazon forest degradation, including their causes and impacts, possible future extents, and some of the interventions required to curb them.                                         ADVANCES                                Analysis of existing data on the extent of fire, edge effects, and timber extraction between 2001 and 2018 reveals that 0.36 {\texttimes}10                 6                 km                 2                 (5.5\%) of the Amazon forest is under some form of degradation, which corresponds to 112\% of the total area deforested in that period. Adding data on extreme droughts increases the estimate of total degraded area to 2.5 {\texttimes}10                 6                 km                 2                 , or 38\% of the remaining Amazonian forests. Estimated carbon loss from these forest disturbances ranges from 0.05 to 0.20 Pg C year                 -1                 and is comparable to carbon loss from deforestation (0.06 to 0.21 Pg C year                 -1                 ).                                  Disturbances can bring about as much biodiversity loss as deforestation itself, and forests degraded by fire and timber extraction can have a 2 to 34\% reduction in dry-season evapotranspiration. The underlying drivers of disturbances (e.g., agricultural expansion or demand for timber) generate material benefits for a restricted group of regional and global actors, whereas the burdens permeate across a broad range of scales and social groups ranging from nearby forest dwellers to urban residents of Andean countries. First-order 2050 projections indicate that the four main disturbances will remain a major threat and source of carbon fluxes to the atmosphere, independent of deforestation trajectories.                                                        OUTLOOK               Whereas some disturbances such as edge effects can be tackled by curbing deforestation, others, like constraining the increase in extreme droughts, require additional measures, including global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Curbing degradation will also require engaging with the diverse set of actors that promote it, operationalizing effective monitoring of different disturbances, and refining policy frameworks such as REDD+. These will all be supported by rapid and multidisciplinary advances in our socioenvironmental understanding of tropical forest degradation, providing a robust platform on which to co-construct appropriate policies and programs to curb it.                                                   An overview of tropical forest degradation processes in the Amazon.                   Underlying drivers (a few of which are shown in gray at the bottom) stimulate disturbances (timber extraction, fire, edge effects, and extreme drought) that cause forest degradation. A satellite illustrates the attempts to estimate degradation's spatial extent and associated carbon losses. Impacts (in red and insets) are either local---causing biodiversity losses or affecting forest-dweller livelihoods---or remote, for example, with smoke affecting people's health in cities or causing the melting of Andean glaciers owing to black carbon deposition.

Distinctively, our influence-directed explanations approach this problem by peering inside the network to identify neurons with high influence on a quantity and distribution of interest, using an axiomatically-justified influence measure, and then providing an interpretation for the concepts these neurons represent. We evaluate our approach by demonstrating a number of its unique capabilities on convolutional neural networks trained on ImageNet. Our evaluation demonstrates that influence-directed explanations (1) identify influential concepts that generalize across instances, (2) can be used to extract the "essence" of what the network learned about a class, and (3) isolate individual features the network uses to make decisions and distinguish related classes.},

Here we express them in terms of numbers of people left outside the `human climate niche'---defined as the historically highly conserved distribution of relative human population density with respect to mean annual temperature. We show that climate change has already put\,{\textasciitilde}9\% of people ({$>$}600 million) outside this niche. By end-of-century (2080--2100), current policies leading to around 2.7\,{$^\circ$}C global warming could leave one-third (22--39\%) of people outside the niche. Reducing global warming from 2.7 to 1.5\,{$^\circ$}C results in a\,{\textasciitilde}5-fold decrease in the population exposed to unprecedented heat (mean annual temperature\,{$\geq$}29\,{$^\circ$}C). The lifetime emissions of\,{\textasciitilde}3.5 global average citizens today (or\,{\textasciitilde}1.2 average US citizens) expose one future person to unprecedented heat by end-of-century. That person comes from a place where emissions today are around half of the global average. These results highlight the need for more decisive policy action to limit the human costs and inequities of climate change.},

  abstract = {The impact of local biodiversity loss on ecosystem functioning is well established, but the role of larger-scale biodiversity dynamics in the delivery of ecosystem services remains poorly understood. Here we address this gap using a comprehensive dataset describing the supply of 16 cultural, regulating and provisioning ecosystem services in 150 European agricultural grassland plots, and detailed multi-scale data on land use and plant diversity. After controlling for land-use and abiotic factors, we show that both plot-level and surrounding plant diversity play an important role in the supply of cultural and aboveground regulating ecosystem services. In contrast, provisioning and belowground regulating ecosystem services are more strongly driven by field-level management and abiotic factors. Structural equation models revealed that surrounding plant diversity promotes ecosystem services both directly, probably by fostering the spill-over of ecosystem service providers from surrounding areas, and indirectly, by maintaining plot-level diversity. By influencing the ecosystem services that local stakeholders prioritized, biodiversity at different scales was also shown to positively influence a wide range of stakeholder groups. These results provide a comprehensive picture of which ecosystem services rely most strongly on biodiversity, and the respective scales of biodiversity that drive these services. This key information is required for the upscaling of biodiversity--ecosystem service relationships, and the informed management of biodiversity within agricultural landscapes.}

Using daily data from November 2018 to June 2020, we use both DY (Diebold \& Yilmaz, 2012) and BK (Barun{\'i}k et~al., 2017) to examine the volatility connectedness of returns series. The results of DY suggest that, first, the total connectedness of 21st century technology assets and traditional common stocks is very high, and hence in the turbulent economy, there is a high probability of contemporaneous losses. Second, Bitcoin, MSCIW, MSCI US, and KFTX are net contributors of volatility shocks whereas US dollar, oil, gold, VIX, green bond and green bond select are net receivers. Therefore, Fintech and common equities are not good hedging instruments in the same portfolio. Third, the short-term witnesses higher volatility transmission than the long-term. That is, holding assets for a long-term is likely to mitigate risks whereas trading financial assets in the short-term can increase risk because of higher volatility. Fourth, the traditional assets, gold and oil, as well as modern assets, green bonds, are useful as good hedgers compared with other assets because shock transmissions from them to Fintech, KFTX are below 0.1\% and, more importantly, the total volatility spill-over of all assets in the sample is moderately average, accounting for 44.39\%.},

A Wino-grad schema is a pair of sentences that differ only in one or two words and that contain a referential ambiguity that is resolved in opposite directions in the two sentences. We have compiled a collection of Winograd schemas, designed so that the correct answer is obvious to the human reader, but cannot easily be found using selectional restrictions or statistical techniques over text corpora. A contestant in the Winograd Schema Challenge is presented with a collection of one sentence from each pair, and required to achieve human-level accuracy in choosing the correct disambiguation.},

  abstract = {As venture capital and industrial resources are increasingly poured into rapid advances in artificial intelligence, the actual usage and success of AI depends on a satisfactory experience for the user. UX will play a significant role in the adoption of AI technologies across markets, and AI and UX explores just what these demands will entail. Great effort has been put forth to continuously make AI ``smarter.'' But, will smarter always equal more successful AI? It is not just about getting a product to market, but about getting the product into a user's hands in a form that will be embraced. This demands examining the product from the perspective of the user. Authors Gavin Lew and Robert Schumacher have written AI and UX to examine just how product managers and designers can best strike this balance. From exploring the history of the parallel journeys of AI and UX, to investigating past product examples and failures, to practical expert knowledge on how to best execute a positive user experience, AI and UX examines all angles of how AI can best be developed within a UX framework. The new world of AI necessitates an equally new UX lens through which to see all potential products. While massive inroads have created strides in AI technology, it must be accessible and easy to use for the consumer. Innovators in the field need to shift thinking from ``it works'' to ``it works well,'' which makes all the difference in increasing adoption. Let your users enhance your data, and let the UX of your product do the selling for you. AI and UX is your roadmap for the future},

  abstract = {Large pre-trained language models have been shown to store factual knowledge in their parameters, and achieve state-of-the-art results when fine-tuned on downstream NLP tasks. However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowledge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance lags behind task-specific architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory can overcome this issue, but have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) -- models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We compare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, the other can use different passages per token. We fine-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks and set the state-of-the-art on three open domain QA tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures. For language generation tasks, we find that RAG models generate more specific, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq baseline.},

The research protocol enables UX and HCI researchers to assess different human-AI interaction solutions and validate design decisions before investing in engineering. We present a detailed account of the research protocol and demonstrate its use by employing it to study an existing set of human-AI interaction guidelines. We used factorial surveys with a 2x2 mixed design to compare user perceptions when a guideline is applied versus violated, under conditions of optimal versus sub-optimal AI performance. The results provided both qualitative and quantitative insights into the UX impact of each guideline. These insights can support creators of user-facing AI systems in their nuanced prioritization and application of the guidelines.}

Although numerous detection methods have been proposed to differentiate between AI and human-generated content, the fairness and robustness of these detectors remain underexplored. In this study, we evaluate the performance of several widely-used GPT detectors using writing samples from native and non-native English writers. Our findings reveal that these detectors consistently misclassify non-native English writing samples as AI-generated, whereas native writing samples are accurately identified. Furthermore, we demonstrate that simple prompting strategies can not only mitigate this bias but also effectively bypass GPT detectors, suggesting that GPT detectors may unintentionally penalize writers with constrained linguistic expressions. Our results call for a broader conversation about the ethical implications of deploying ChatGPT content detectors and caution against their use in evaluative or educational settings, particularly when they may inadvertently penalize or exclude non-native English speakers from the global discourse.

  abstract = {Language models (LMs) are becoming the foundation for almost all major language technologies, but their capabilities, limitations, and risks are not well understood. We present Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) to improve the transparency of language models. First, we taxonomize the vast space of potential scenarios (i.e. use cases) and metrics (i.e. desiderata) that are of interest for LMs. Then we select a broad subset based on coverage and feasibility, noting what's missing or underrepresented (e.g. question answering for neglected English dialects, metrics for trustworthiness). Second, we adopt a multi-metric approach: We measure 7 metrics (accuracy, calibration, robustness, fairness, bias, toxicity, and efficiency) for each of 16 core scenarios when possible (87.5\% of the time). This ensures metrics beyond accuracy don't fall to the wayside, and that trade-offs are clearly exposed. We also perform 7 targeted evaluations, based on 26 targeted scenarios, to analyze specific aspects (e.g. reasoning, disinformation). Third, we conduct a large-scale evaluation of 30 prominent language models (spanning open, limited-access, and closed models) on all 42 scenarios, 21 of which were not previously used in mainstream LM evaluation. Prior to HELM, models on average were evaluated on just 17.9\% of the core HELM scenarios, with some prominent models not sharing a single scenario in common. We improve this to 96.0\%: now all 30 models have been densely benchmarked on the same core scenarios and metrics under standardized conditions. Our evaluation surfaces 25 top-level findings. For full transparency, we release all raw model prompts and completions publicly for further analysis, as well as a general modular toolkit. We intend for HELM to be a living benchmark for the community, continuously updated with new scenarios, metrics, and models.},

This research adopts the questionnaire survey method and takes elementary school teachers from the second largest city in Taiwan, Taichung City, as the research sample. Stratified random sampling was adopted, and 636 questionnaires were distributed. In total, 536 questionnaires were effectively recovered, and the effective recovery rate was 84.27\%. The descriptive statistical analysis of sample data, an independent sample T-test, a one-way analysis of variance, Scheffe's comparison test, and Pearson's product-difference correlation were used for analysis. The study results are: (1) Elementary school teachers in Taichung City have good environmental education and teaching cognition and environmental issue cognition. (2) The attitudes toward the environmental education of elementary school teachers in Taichung are positive and active. (3) Senior and experienced elementary school teachers in Taichung City have a high awareness of environmental education due to their participation in many workshops and environmental protection activities. Therefore, there are significant differences in the cognition and attitude of environmental education from elementary school teachers. (4) There is a significant correlation between the cognition and attitude of elementary school teachers in Taichung City toward environmental education. This research shows that teachers with more senior teaching experience have better cognition and attitude toward environmental education.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Question               Semi-natural grasslands (SNG) are important for maintaining biodiversity and ecological processes in farmland. Current pasture-based livestock production mainly occurs on intensified grasslands (IG) that have been agronomically improved. Although it is documented that SNG and IG differ in terms of plant diversity, their ability to provide ecosystem services (ES) in farmland is less explored. Here, we review the role of SNG and IG in delivering ES, illustrate their trade-offs and synergies, and examine how ES can be assessed by using plant traits and functional richness.                                         Results               We found that SNG generate a wider range of ES than IG. Trade-offs exist between ES that appear more pronounced in IG between high biomass production and other ES. SNG are good in providing habitat for biodiversity, supporting pollination and cultural services. SNG also have a significantly wider range of plant functional traits and a higher functional richness, suggesting that the potential to supply ES in SNG is partly driven by higher number of species and their functional diversity.                                         Conclusion               Clearer trade-offs were found in IG compared with SNG, supported both by the literature and the functional richness. This suggests that functional knowledge could be a good complement to understand the mechanisms behind ES generation and could help with tailoring grassland management to sustain biodiversity, ecological functions and ES. Although both IG and SNG are likely needed for the long-term sustainability of food production, both could aim for a more balanced generation of ES, increasing biodiversity and functional redundancy at the landscape scale.},

Most, if not all, plasticizer-contaminated food items were due to malicious replacement of palm oil with phthalate plasticizer(s) in the cloudy-agent formulas by two upstream manufacturers. The incumbent agencies in Taiwan took necessary actions to minimize the harm caused by the incident and to ease the panic of the general public. In this paper, the incident was briefly reviewed and the situations of phthalate exposure in general public and pregnant women were assessed. Subsequently, the associations between phthalates exposure and the adverse health effects, such as shortened anogenital distance in baby boys, premature thelarche in young girls, endometriosis, adenomyosis, and leiomyoma in women, and decreased semen quality in men, were discussed. Food safety issue has become a worldwide concern and early detection of potential new toxicants in the foods is indispensable. Therefore, it is imperative to establish an international network for early warning or sentinel on food safety.},

As a more scalable alternative, we introduce Prismer, a data- and parameter-efficient vision-language model that leverages an ensemble of domain experts. Prismer only requires training of a small number of components, with the majority of network weights inherited from readily-available, pre-trained domain experts, and kept frozen during training. By leveraging experts from a wide range of domains, we show that Prismer can efficiently pool this expert knowledge and adapt it to various vision-language reasoning tasks. In our experiments, we show that Prismer achieves fine-tuned and few-shot learning performance which is competitive with current state-of-the-art models, whilst requiring up to two orders of magnitude less training data.

  abstract = {幽默在十九世紀中期以後開始受到西方社會的重視，到了二十一世紀，幽默更被視為全球化時代跨文化溝通中不可或缺的能力之一。幽默深受文化的影響，因此，臺灣華語作為一個獨立的語言變體，其幽默具有特殊性。本文旨在研究臺灣華語幽默策略，以圖文為主的網路迷因作為分析文本，並依據相關文獻及前人研究建立分析理論架構，從三個面向分析一共150筆的網路迷因。研究結果顯示，從幽默風格面向來看，臺灣華語網路迷因幽默策略主要以親和型為主；從幽默主題來看，臺灣華語網路迷因幽默策略人際關係為主。從幽默手法的面向來看，臺灣華語網路迷因的幽默手法主要以婉曲為主。臺灣華語幽默策略不僅反映了網路迷因的幽默本質，也展現了Hofstede（2011）文化構面理論中臺灣社會的文化特色。本文根據研究結果，以零點計畫「可見思考」的思考工具作為教學活動基礎，呈現臺灣華語幽默策略的教學應用。最後，本文提出研究限制與未來研究建議，作為後續相關研究的參考。}

  abstract = {Financial advisors seek to accurately measure individuals' risk preferences and provide sound personalized investment advice. Both advice tasks are increasingly offered through automated online technologies. Little is known, however, about what drives individuals' acceptance of such automated financial advice and, from a consumer point of view, which firms may be best positioned to provide such advice. We generate novel insights on these questions by conducting a real-world empirical study using an interactive automated online tool that employs an innovative computer algorithm to build pension investment profiles, the ``Pension Builder,'' and a large, representative sample. We focus on the role that two key firm characteristics have on consumer acceptance of pension investment advice generated by computer algorithms running on automated interactive online tools: profit orientation and role in the sales channel. We find that consumers' perceptions of trust and expertise of the firm providing the automated advice are important drivers of advice acceptance (besides a strong impact of the satisfaction with the consumer--online tool interaction), and that these constructs themselves are clearly influenced by the for-profit vs. not-for-profit orientation and the product provider vs. advisor only role in the sales channel of the firm providing the advice. We discuss the implications of our findings for marketers and policy makers and provide suggestions for future research.},

  abstract = {This paper is a technical overview of DeepMind and Google's recent work on reinforcement learning for controlling commercial cooling systems. Building on expertise that began with cooling Google's data centers more efficiently, we recently conducted live experiments on two real-world facilities in partnership with Trane Technologies, a building management system provider. These live experiments had a variety of challenges in areas such as evaluation, learning from offline data, and constraint satisfaction. Our paper describes these challenges in the hope that awareness of them will benefit future applied RL work. We also describe the way we adapted our RL system to deal with these challenges, resulting in energy savings of approximately 9\% and 13\% respectively at the two live experiment sites.},

  abstract = {The doughnut economy is a new approach for the inclusion of planetary boundaries and social foundation in the development of societies. The Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations (UN) determine another view for development targets. The developed sustainability window approach provides a means for operationalization and quantification of the doughnut economy. The developed method calculates minimum economic development to guarantee sustainable social development and maximum economic development not to exceed environmental sustainability. The developed method, advanced suitability analysis (ASA) doughnut, is illustrated with case data from Thailand. The sustainability doughnut for Thailand has been calculated for both weak and strong sustainability criteria. It seems that strong sustainability is a too strict requirement regarding several environmental dimensions of development while the weak sustainability criteria are fulfilled. The developed method and tool are flexible and can be used for comparative analysis of different countries or regions, for dynamic analysis of sustainability development, for gap analysis of the required improvement of environmental or social efficiency, and analysis of degrowth possibilities. The selection of indicators for the analyses and their reliability is crucial for the validity of the results and usefulness in policy planning.},

  abstract = {To support the sustainable development of the primary sector, in line with green new deals emerging worldwide, eco-design of new agri-food products is a priority. The wine industry, due to its growing market, has matured the need to develop an approach for understanding the environmental impacts of its products and to develop strategies to reduce such impacts in a life cycle perspective. This study has a two-fold aim: presenting the development of a methodological proposal for the use of PEF and PEF-CR in the eco-design of wine products; testing its applicability in a case study in the wine sector. The methodological proposal considered the combination of ISO 14006 and PEF methods into a procedure consisting of 8 steps. The proposal was successfully applied in the case of an Italian vinery committed to develop a new red wine product with improved performance if compared to its standard red wine production. The study occurred between 2018 and 2020, collecting primary data related to vineyards and vinery operations. Results proved that PEF method and PEF-CR can be effectively used in the eco-design of new wine products with reduced environmental impacts. Moreover, the study confirmed that PEF method can be used within the framework of ISO 14006. The study on standard red wine production confirmed that the fuel and pesticide consumption in the vineyard operation are environmental hotspots. To reduce these impacts, a new selection of Merlot Khorus grapes was made by the Italian vinery. Results of the eco-designed proved that the new product scored a reduction in the potential environmental impacts.},

The instrument of these policies is a tax levied on the natural resource. These policies are assumed to be applied by the public authorities after the downturn of the households'utility function due to the increase of pollution. With respect to the laissez-faire situation, their impact is to simultaneously decrease production and pollution on the one hand and increase welfare on the other. A delayed reaction of the public authorities after the turnover of the households'utility function implies a higher tax rate on the resource during the first periods. If the authorities'preference for the future is higher, then welfare gains from the degrowth policy are lower for the first generations of the dynasty and higher for the later. The impact of technical progress saving the resource or improving the pollution treatment is also analysed.},

We theorize circumstances under which firms are less likely to engage in such selective disclosure, focusing on organizational and institutional factors that intensify scrutiny and expectations of transparency and that foster civil society mobilization. We test our hypotheses using a novel panel data set of 4,750 public companies across many industries that are headquartered in 45 countries during 2004--2007. Results show that firms that are more environmentally damaging, particularly those in countries where they are more exposed to scrutiny and global norms, are less likely to engage in selective disclosure. We discuss contributions to research on institutional theory, strategic management, and information disclosure.},

  abstract = {While the literature on food waste has examined mainstream consumers, it has tended to overlook `green' consumers. Based on a survey with 346 respondents, techniques such as cross tabulations, non-parametric tests and the ordered probit regression model were used to analyse the data. Variables such as age, making an effort to reduce food waste, guilt and anxiety about wasting food, along with knowledge of expiry dates, were associated with lower levels of food waste. Surprisingly, eating organic food was not linked with a lower propensity to waste food. There did not appear to be a large gap between attitudes towards food waste and actual behaviours. Higher income households, with young children, who eat out a lot, were more likely to waste food. A good deal of food was thrown away due to spoilage, the short shelf-life of fresh food and because people forgot about food left in the fridge. A limitation of the survey is the reliance on self-reported data for food waste. The findings have practical implications for public policy makers who wish to reduce the economic and environmental burden of food waste.},

  abstract = {Solar photovoltaic (PV) technology offers a promising means to alleviate environmental and electricity costs challenges for cryptocurrency miners. To analyze this promise, this study investigated the feasibility of using electricity from individually optimized PV systems to power: 1) an individual Bitcoin miner, 2) a DIY intermodal shipping container holding 50 miners, and 3) a commercial mining farm container holding 408 miners. In a controlled lab environment, miners were monitored for electricity use. Then using these values, numerical simulations of both the PV system yield and sensitivity ranges based on the Bitcoin price, Bitcoin halving events, and miner hardware were investigated for informed financial planning. In addition, sensitivity for geographic locations in North America, utility electric rates and PV capital costs were analyzed. The profitability and return on investment (ROI) varied by location primarily because of the geographic distribution of solar flux and utility rates. The ROI for using PV with Bitcoin mining was found to be negative for Toronto and Montreal because of low-cost electricity, while it was 8\% for Calgary. In the U.S. cities evaluated, the ROIs were substantial and ranged from 34\% in New York, to 64\% in Boulder, and up to 104\% in Los Angeles. Although the study is based in North America regarding energy rates, climate, and energy laws, the analysis methodology is generalizable globally and grants the average cryptocurrency business the knowledge to make an informed decision on whether to pursue this venture from a financial and environmental perspective. This study contributes to the body of knowledge in cryptocurrency mining by providing an economic means of environmental preservation by powering cryptocurrency miners with renewable solar energy.},

  month = dec,
  abstract = {The devastating effects that unsustainable design practices have on the natural world and other species with whom we share this planet have gained widespread awareness and are the driving force behind attempts to develop more sustainable design approaches. These efforts tend to focus on minimising the negative effects that design has on the natural world by reduced material and energy usage. However, the possibility that design may have an active role in mitigating the erosion of biodiversity has only entered the discussion in recent years and remains a marginal activity for design. Following an ongoing paradigm shift calling for the inclusion of a greater diversity of wild animals within human-dominated habitats (as a way of addressing both the erosion of biodiversity and humankind's alienation from nature), this research proposes that there is a growing need for a design practice capable of responding to the needs of wild animals, while addressing questions of human-animal interaction. In this thesis, Multispecies Design is proposed and developed as a theoretical framework for supporting the shift to more biodiverse human habitats. The research addresses both the physical and socio-cultural requirements of such a shift. Three distinct views define this emerging design approach: recognising animals as clients of design, recognising human-animal interactions as designed experiences and the view of manmade systems as further extensions of ecological systems. The methodological implications of Multispecies Design have been explored in a case study design project concerned with the ecological enhancement of a coastal outfall pipe on a highly frequented beach in Cornwall, UK. The case study explored ways of designing to address the needs of both people and of wild animal species, as well as the interactions between the two groups. It focused on identifying and developing design approaches and tools for studying and representing wild animals in design projects to facilitate their integration into built environments. These tools were further refined in a series of workshops with design and art students carried out during the PhD research. The insights from the practical work, together with the theoretical framework developed alongside them, have led to the development of Principles of Multispecies Design and practical and conceptual Tools for Multispecies Design.}

While the idea of mindful consumption has great potential, there is little empirical research to date that comprehensively examines the consumer perspective on the role of mindfulness on consumption. To provide a grounded consumer perspective, the authors segment mindful consumption views from open-end text using a mixed method of clustering and text mining. By analyzing the segmentation structure, the authors discover various consumer views of mindful consumption, such as careful economic based consumption, monitoring activities of firms, and being informed about the impact of consumption choices. The authors compare the empirical results with the academic literature to provide directions for future research.},

This study is a portrayal of online teaching-learning modes adopted by the Mizoram University for the teaching-learning process and subsequent semester examinations. It looks forward to an intellectually enriched opportunity for further future academic decision-making during any adversity. The intended purpose of this paper seeks to address the required essentialities of online teaching-learning in education amid the COVID-19 pandemic and how can existing resources of educational institutions effectively transform formal education into online education with the help of virtual classes and other pivotal online tools in this continually shifting educational landscape. The paper employs both quantitative and qualitative approach to study the perceptions of teachers and students on online teaching-learning modes and also highlighted the implementation process of online teaching-learning modes. The value of this paper is to draw a holistic picture of ongoing online teaching-learning activities during the lockdown period including establishing the linkage between change management process and online teaching-learning process in education system amid the COVID-19 outbreak so as to overcome the persisting academic disturbance and consequently ensure the resumption of educational activities and discourses as a normal course of procedure in the education system.},

  abstract = {In this study, the circularity of multifunction photocopier toner bottles is evaluated using Life Cycle Simulation (LCS) focusing on component remanufacturing and the effect of circularity on life cycle cost and CO2 emissions is quantified. LCS, which executes discrete event simulations, can evaluate the circularity of the entire life cycle of products. A what-if analysis is undertaken by varying the parameters, including the maximum remanufacturing count, number of remanufacturing sites, collection rate, and compatibility between new and old generations of photocopiers. This study determines that the compatibility of new and old copier models is critically important for increasing circularity and reducing CO2 emissions and life cycle costs. CO2 emissions and life cycle costs are reduced to 42\% and 87\%, respectively, comparing to the situation where the bottles are not remanufactured at all. However, some difficulties in obtaining the required data from the manufacturer made it difficult to evaluate circularity.},

  abstract = {The valuation of nature and ecosystem services in monetary units plays a central role in many forms of environmental governance, including in carbon and biodiversity markets and offsetting schemes which are increasingly under scrutiny. The idea of using monetary units to value nature has precipitated significant debate, with proponents contending that it represents a pragmatic and realist approach to accounting for the environment in decision-making processes, unlocking substantial funding for conservation, while others argue that it can lead to a commodification of nature that ultimately proves inequitable and ineffective in addressing environmental challenges. In the spirit of developing a constructive dialogue on the issue, Kate Raworth will moderate a discussion between two ecological economists, Robert Costanza and Erik Gomez-Baggethun, who will explore the debates and tensions associated with using monetary units to value nature and ecosystem services and role such valuations play in contemporary environmental governance.}

  abstract = {The concept of calm technology envisions that interaction with technology should consume minimal resources and cause as few distractions as possible. The main goal of our study was to compare different forms of embodiment of Voice User Interfaces (VUI) in terms of how much they distract a user from a cognitive task. We used a voice-only system without physical embodiment (voice-only), a physical embodied system without anthropomorphic features (physical embodied), and a social embodied VUI with social cues such as eye movements (social embodied). In addition, we explored the relationship between design features of the VUI and perceived distraction, social presence, and perceived calm. Twenty-four participants carried out four different cognitive tasks with the three different VUI and one round of cognitive tasks without any VUI present. The cognitive tasks were chosen from a serious game (BrainTagger Suit) and included measurements of cognitive speed, working memory, visual memory, and process inhibition. Overall, results indicated the voice-only VUI caused the least distraction, especially for cognitive speed, while slightly showing impairment for visual memory. Social embodied VUI appeared to cause the most distraction across the four cognitive tasks with physical embodied VUI falling in between. Surprisingly, social presence was perceived as highest for the voice-only system which at the same time received the lowest scores for perceived calm. The advantages and disadvantages of each VUI are discussed.},

  abstract = {Today, artificial intelligence (AI), especially machine learning, is structurally dependent on human participation. Technologies such as deep learning (DL) leverage networked media infrastructures and human-machine interaction designs to harness users to provide training and verification data. The emergence of DL is therefore based on a fundamental socio-technological transformation of the relationship between humans and machines. Rather than simulating human intelligence, DL-based AIs capture human cognitive abilities, so they are hybrid human-machine apparatuses. From a perspective of media philosophy and social-theoretical critique, I differentiate five types of ``media technologies of capture'' in AI apparatuses and analyze them as forms of power relations between humans and machines. Finally, I argue that the current hype about AI implies a relational and distributed understanding of (human/artificial) intelligence, which I categorize under the term ``cybernetic AI.'' This form of AI manifests in socio-technological apparatuses that involve new modes of subjectivation, social control, and digital labor.},

Although ecodesign methods incorporate circular economy (CE) principles, they are little explored in projects and constructions. This study analyses how the construction sector approaches ecodesign methods to achieve buildings' deconstruction. Through an integrative literature review, 288 articles were threefold analyzed: (i) bibliometric, (ii) conceptually about ecodesign methods, and (iii) categorically. The results showed a lack of understanding about the ecodesign concepts, and an integrated methodology was proposed. The most inclusive and sustainable ecodesign method for buildings deconstruction was Design for Adaptability and Disassembly (DfAD). The review shows the concentration of the studies in three categories and a framework was created relating DfAD strategies. The sector needs more information on ecodesign methods, deconstruction strategies, reusing of materials, and in the life cycle tools as decision support to make sustainable buildings.},

Design/methodology/approach                                Data were collected from a sample of younger millennials (                 n                 = 276; age = 18 to 30) using a self-administered questionnaire. The data were then analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) technique.                                                        Findings               Overall, the results of the study reveal that rational and self-oriented rather than emotional and others-oriented motives lead millennials to act pro-environmentally.                                         Practical implications               The findings of this study have implications for environmental advocates, policymakers and green marketers. For instance, the findings suggest that environmental regulators and lawmakers should continue their efforts to provide economic incentives to encourage pro-environmental purchases among millennials. Additionally, marketers of green products may pursue self-directed targeting strategies in promoting green products among millennials.                                         Originality/value               Millennials grasp the environmental consequences of their actions and have the education, motivation and social awareness to participate in the green movement. However, they have not truly begun to fully integrate their beliefs and actions. The present study is an initial attempt to address this issue by investigating various psychological factors that are relevant to the millennials' core behavioral motives.},

For carbon emissions and other environmental damage, this means ensuring that those responsible pay their full costs rather than continuing to pass them along to others, including future generations. In The Spirit of Green, Nobel Prize-winning economist William Nordhaus describes a new way of green thinking that would help us overcome our biggest challenges without sacrificing economic prosperity, in large part by accounting for the spillover costs of economic collisions. In a discussion that ranges from the history of the environmental movement to the Green New Deal, Nordhaus explains how the spirit of green thinking provides a compelling and hopeful new perspective on modern life. At the heart of green thinking is a recognition that the globalized world is shaped not by isolated individuals but rather by innumerable interactions inside and outside the economy. He shows how rethinking economic efficiency, sustainability, politics, profits, taxes, individual ethics, corporate social responsibility, finance, and more would improve the effectiveness and equity of our society. And he offers specific solutions-on how to price carbon, how to pursue low-carbon technologies, how to design an efficient tax system, and how to foster international cooperation through climate clubs. The result is a groundbreaking new vision of how we can have our environment and our economy too"--},

  abstract = {One of the goals of the European Union (EU) is to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. To this end, internal combustion vehicles (ICVs) will be progressively replaced with battery electric vehicles (BEVs) over the course of a transition period that is expected to last until 2035. While GHG reductions have been extensively evaluated for continental territories, this is not the case for territories with isolated electrical power systems, as in some islands of the EU. Emissions generated in these territories are considerably higher than in continental systems because their electricity generation mixes commonly have more polluting fuels. In this study, a calculation is performed of the CO2 emissions that result from the charging of a reference BEV in the different isolated electrical power systems of the Canary Islands (Spain). The results are then compared with the CO2 emissions of ICVs. Results show that the Canary electrical power systems that consume the least energy are the most contaminating and that charging a BEV entails higher CO2 emissions than those generated by an ICV. In addition, no significant differences were observed between BEV- and ICV-related CO2 emissions in the electrical power systems of the islands with higher energy consumption. A small decrease in CO2 emissions was only observed in isolated insular systems with energy storage systems and high levels of renewable penetration.}

This paper investigates one of these lifestyles: minimalism. The adopters of this lifestyle believe that by avoiding overconsumption, they are adhering to conscious consumption and challenging the so-called consumer society. Nevertheless, the development path for minimalists remains unclear. Through this multi-method study, we seek to discover how a consumer becomes a minimalist. We targeted self-proclaimed minimalists and members of Facebook communities related to this lifestyle politics. The findings led us to propose a visual representation of a non-linear minimalist process, composed by overlapped stages, in which consumers choose to engage. By showing the component parts of minimalism, we indicate a new way to approach the topic. We also contributed to outline how consumers forge their identities through de-growth in consumption practices and unveiled tensions behind minimalism lifestyle. We concluded by proposing venues for future research.},

GPT-4 is a Transformer-based model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The post-training alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to accurately predict some aspects of GPT-4's performance based on models trained with no more than 1/1,000th the compute of GPT-4.},

  abstract = {Business researchers use experimental methods extensively due to their high internal validity. However, controlled laboratory and crowdsourcing settings often introduce issues of artificiality, data contamination, and low managerial relevance of the dependent variables. Field experiments can overcome these issues but are traditionally time- and resource-consuming. This primer presents an alternative experimental setting to conduct online field experiments in a time- and cost-effective way. It does so by introducing the Facebook A/B split test functionality, which allows for random assignment of manipulated variables embedded in ecologically-valid stimuli. We compare and contrast this method against laboratory settings and Amazon Mechanical Turk in terms of design flexibility, managerial relevance, data quality control, and sample representativeness. We then provide an empirical demonstration of how to set up, pre-test, run, and analyze FBST experiments.},

To make urban transport sustainable, cities are increasingly investing to develop their bicycle networks. However, it is yet unclear how to extend them comprehensively and effectively given a limited budget. Here we investigate the structure of bicycle networks in cities around the world, and find that they consist of hundreds of disconnected patches, even in cycling-friendly cities like Copenhagen. To connect these patches, we develop and apply data-driven, algorithmic network growth strategies, showing that small but focused investments allow to significantly increase the connectedness and directness of urban bicycle networks. We introduce two greedy algorithms to add the most critical missing links in the bicycle network focusing on connectedness, and show that they outmatch both a random approach and a baseline minimum investment strategy. Our computational approach outlines novel pathways from car-centric towards sustainable cities by taking advantage of urban data available on a city-wide scale. It is a first step towards a quantitative consolidation of bicycle infrastructure development that can become valuable for urban planners and stakeholders.},

The data was collected from students of the Moroccan Higher Education Institutions. The research data are collected via an on a self-administered online questionnaire, from a sample of 264 university students. The responses are collected from students of 12 Moroccan universities and 31 Moroccan educational institutions. The data were analyzed using a structural equation modeling method under the Partial Least Squares approach (PLS-SEM). Data analysis was performed using SmartPLS 3 software. Universities managers can use the dataset to identify key factor to enhance e-learning system success.},

  abstract = {Making language models bigger does not inherently make them better at following a user's intent. For example, large language models can generate outputs that are untruthful, toxic, or simply not helpful to the user. In other words, these models are not aligned with their users. In this paper, we show an avenue for aligning language models with user intent on a wide range of tasks by fine-tuning with human feedback. Starting with a set of labeler-written prompts and prompts submitted through the OpenAI API, we collect a dataset of labeler demonstrations of the desired model behavior, which we use to fine-tune GPT-3 using supervised learning. We then collect a dataset of rankings of model outputs, which we use to further fine-tune this supervised model using reinforcement learning from human feedback. We call the resulting models InstructGPT. In human evaluations on our prompt distribution, outputs from the 1.3B parameter InstructGPT model are preferred to outputs from the 175B GPT-3, despite having 100x fewer parameters. Moreover, InstructGPT models show improvements in truthfulness and reductions in toxic output generation while having minimal performance regressions on public NLP datasets. Even though InstructGPT still makes simple mistakes, our results show that fine-tuning with human feedback is a promising direction for aligning language models with human intent.},

  abstract = {We submit that the safe operating space of the planetary boundary of novel entities is exceeded since annual production and releases are increasing at a pace that outstrips the global capacity for assessment and monitoring. The novel entities boundary in the planetary boundaries framework refers to entities that are novel in a geological sense and that could have large-scale impacts that threaten the integrity of Earth system processes. We review the scientific literature relevant to quantifying the boundary for novel entities and highlight plastic pollution as a particular aspect of high concern. An impact pathway from production of novel entities to impacts on Earth system processes is presented. We define and apply three criteria for assessment of the suitability of control variables for the boundary: feasibility, relevance, and comprehensiveness. We propose several complementary control variables to capture the complexity of this boundary, while acknowledging major data limitations. We conclude that humanity is currently operating outside the planetary boundary based on the weight-of-evidence for several of these control variables. The increasing rate of production and releases of larger volumes and higher numbers of novel entities with diverse risk potentials exceed societies' ability to conduct safety related assessments and monitoring. We recommend taking urgent action to reduce the harm associated with exceeding the boundary by reducing the production and releases of novel entities, noting that even so, the persistence of many novel entities and/or their associated effects will continue to pose a threat.},

  abstract = {Stock market price prediction has improved due to social network activity since social networks can provide useful information, for example, on message sentiment. Few studies have analysed the influence of social networks on the bond market, and even fewer have specifically analysed the influence on the green bond market. By financing environmental projects that promote sustainability, green bonds are becoming increasingly important because of their relationship with major issues, such as climate change and water management. In addition, increases in people's environmental awareness have led companies to enact corporate social responsibility policies and environmentally sustainable projects. This context supports the relevance of this research because although there have been previous studies on green bonds, there is a scarcity of manuscripts that relate green bonds with social media and, more specifically, with investors' sentiments. Therefore, using panel data analysis, the aim of this study is to analyze how the investor sentiment extracted from social networks influences the green bond market. The results of this manuscript should lead investors and markets to consider social networks as relevant sources of information not only for the equity market but also for the bond market, specifically the green bond market.},

  abstract = {The global impacts of food production             Food is produced and processed by millions of farmers and intermediaries globally, with substantial associated environmental costs. Given the heterogeneity of producers, what is the best way to reduce food's environmental impacts? Poore and Nemecek consolidated data on the multiple environmental impacts of {$\sim$}38,000 farms producing 40 different agricultural goods around the world in a meta-analysis comparing various types of food production systems. The environmental cost of producing the same goods can be highly variable. However, this heterogeneity creates opportunities to target the small numbers of producers that have the most impact.                            Science               , this issue p.               987                        ,              Food producer heterogeneity on a global level creates mitigation opportunities with respect to environmental damage caused by food production.           ,              Food's environmental impacts are created by millions of diverse producers. To identify solutions that are effective under this heterogeneity, we consolidated data covering five environmental indicators; 38,700 farms; and 1600 processors, packaging types, and retailers. Impact can vary 50-fold among producers of the same product, creating substantial mitigation opportunities. However, mitigation is complicated by trade-offs, multiple ways for producers to achieve low impacts, and interactions throughout the supply chain. Producers have limits on how far they can reduce impacts. Most strikingly, impacts of the lowest-impact animal products typically exceed those of vegetable substitutes, providing new evidence for the importance of dietary change. Cumulatively, our findings support an approach where producers monitor their own impacts, flexibly meet environmental targets by choosing from multiple practices, and communicate their impacts to consumers.},

These large-scale land-use changes have already resulted in considerable biodiversity loss but can also lead to decline in ecosystem service provision and ecosystem multifunctionality.                                                     We assessed the impact of afforestation and abandonment of semi-natural grasslands on the supply of ecosystem services in Western Estonia. We compared a wide array of services provided by open grasslands, abandoned grasslands and afforested grasslands. Additionally, we analysed the impact of land-use change and species richness on ecosystem multifunctionality.                                                     Significant declines in the supply of pollination services, natural pest regulation, forage production, soil quality, wild food and cultural appreciation of landscape were detected as a result of overgrowing or afforestation.                                                     There was significant positive relationship between species richness and ecosystem multifunctionality, that is, more biodiverse grasslands were able to support more services at higher capacity.                                                     Results show that both grassland degradation due to abandonment, as well as grassland afforestation, have significant negative impacts on biodiversity, on the supply of multiple important ecosystem services and on the ecosystem multifunctionality.                                                                          Synthesis and applications.                     Temperate semi-natural grasslands have high biodiversity and capacity to deliver multiple important ecosystem services simultaneously. Conservation and restoration of grassland habitats must be considered as an important part of sustainable landscape planning.},

  abstract = {Compostable and biodegradable plastics are growing in popularity but their environmental credentials need to be more fully assessed to determine how they can be a part of the solution to the plastic waste crisis. We present results and analysis on home compostable packaging. This type of packaging requires the citizen to be able to correctly identify the packaging as ``home compostable,'' to have composting facilities at home, and to successfully compost the plastic. Using a citizen science approach, we engaged with 9,701 UK citizens geographically spread across the UK to examine their capability, opportunity, and motivation to do this. Of this cohort 1,648 citizens performed home compost experiments to test the environmental performance of compostable plastics. We report on the type of plastics they tested and their disintegration under real home composting conditions. The results show that the public are confused about the meaning of the labels of compostable and biodegradable plastics. 14\% of sampled plastic packaging items tested were certified ``industrial compostable'' only and 46\% had no compostable certification. Of the biodegradable and compostable plastics tested under different home composting conditions, the majority did not fully disintegrate, including 60\% of those that were certified ``home compostable.'' We conclude that for both of these reasons, home composting is not an effective or environmentally beneficial waste processing method for biodegradable or compostable packaging in the UK.},

A quantitative approach based on survey method was used to collect data from 340 LIS students from nine public sector universities of Pakistan through an online questionnaire. The collected data was analyzed using the SPSS and AMOS. The findings revealed that LIS students were not fully personalized and successful in decisions about their online educational activities during COVID-19 pandemic. However, they were motivated to learn through online learning and felt confident in performing basic functions of computers and internet. A significant difference of opinion was observed on `computer/internet self-efficacy' and `online communication self-efficacy' based on respondents' gender. Similarly, students from different levels of degree programs reported significantly different computer, internet, and online communication self-efficacy and learning motivation. Moreover, the age and grades of respondents were noted to be strong predictors of their OLR. These findings would be helpful for library schools, universities, and faculty members in Pakistan to improve the quality of online education and implement clear policies and guidelines. This study provides some theoretical and practical implications based on the findings.},

  abstract = {This study explored how university students remained motivated to learn, despite all the limitations they encountered and endured during the COVID-19 pandemic. This work was carried out in Indonesia, but the benefits are beyond a stateboundary. The study examines how university students in developing countries have faced obstacles, and yet despite this, they are still trying their hardest to stay focused on achieving their personal goals during the pandemic. This research employed a qualitative phenomenological approach, involving eighty students that were studying at the Faculty of Education at a state university in Jakarta, Indonesia. As data collection techniques, students were asked to write learning log diaries and reflective essays and to participate in an online focus group discussion. The results showed that the students' motivation to remain learning during the COVID-19 pandemic fell into three key themes, each with associated sub-themes. The three themes and sub-themes described were: (a) personal, with sub-themes of challenge, curiosity, self-determination, satisfaction and religious commitment; (b) social, with sub-themes of relationships, inspiration, and well-being of self and others; and (c) environmental, with sub-themes of facilities and conditioning. The themes and sub-themes indicate the source of motivation for these university students to learn during the pandemic. This study concluded that these emerging adults were both intrinsically and extrinsically autonomously motivated and committed to their studies. Most of these students were motivated by their consequential aspirations, not by a controlled motivation, nor were they motivated by a reward, a penalty, or a rule that propelled them. By defining how the students managed to empower themselves, this study recommends the importance of preparing students to be more resilient and to enable them to cultivate the ability to remain optimistic and motivated to succeed and overcome any of life's adversities.},

  abstract = {Purpose Academia is experiencing massive reforms globally amid lockdown in COVID-19 outbreak. This study is aimed to apprehend the enabling and impeding factors of these reforms, with a focus on optometry education. It brings together how the Indian optometry educational system has responded to COVID-19 disruptions with findings of the 2020 survey, in light of similar survey done in 2018. Methodology A cross-sectional survey was designed to find changes in optometry training and adaptations of Indian optometry educators amid COVID 19 lockdown. In the last week of April 2020, on the observation that the majority of optometry institutions have switched their teaching-learning activities on e-learning mode, an online survey was conducted using a validated questionnaire containing a mix of open and close-ended questions. Results Seventy-three out of 78 optometry educators (93.58\%) have switched to e-learning mode in a very short time span with good confidence. Most teaching-learning and assessment activities are carried out using multi-device supporting video conferencing tools, dedicated educational portals and social media apps. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic is proving to be a constructive disruptor, giving an opportunity for restructuring the present conventional, classroom based educational system. The quick transitions to online mode assisted in keeping continuity of optometry education programs, effectively fitting in the purpose of completion of the current academic year. The rapid transition to online education has not only benefited optometry students but also has created a momentum of continued education for practicing optometrist in the country. Resumen Prop{\'o}sito: La Academia est{\'a} experimentando reformas masivas a nivel mundial en medio del bloqueo del brote del COVID-19. Este estudio tiene como objetivo aprehender los factores favorables y desfavorables de estas reformas, con un enfoque en la educaci{\'o}n de la optometr{\'i}a. Re{\'u}ne c{\'o}mo el sistema educativo de optometr{\'i}a de la India ha respondido a los trastornos del COVID-19 con los resultados de la encuesta de 2020, a la luz de una encuesta similar realizada en 2018. Metodolog{\'i}a: Una encuesta transversal fue dise{\~n}ada para encontrar cambios en la formaci{\'o}n de optometr{\'i}a y adaptaciones de los educadores de optometr{\'i}a de la India en medio del cierre del COVID 19. En la {\'u}ltima semana de abril de 2020, a partir de la observaci{\'o}n de que la mayor{\'i}a de las instituciones de optometr{\'i}a han cambiado sus actividades de ense{\~n}anza-aprendizaje en el modo de aprendizaje electr{\'o}nico, se realiz{\'o} una encuesta en l{\'i}nea utilizando un cuestionario validado que conten{\'i}a una mezcla de preguntas abiertas y cerradas. Resultados: Setenta y tres de 78 educadores de optometr{\'i}a (93,58\%) han cambiado a la modalidad de aprendizaje electr{\'o}nico en un per{\'i}odo de tiempo muy corto con buena confianza. La mayor{\'i}a de las actividades de ense{\~n}anza-aprendizaje y evaluaci{\'o}n se llevan a cabo utilizando herramientas de videoconferencia de apoyo multidispositivo, portales educativos dedicados y aplicaciones de redes sociales. Conclusi{\'o}n: La pandemia del COVID-19 est{\'a} demostrando ser un disruptor constructivo, que ofrece la oportunidad de reestructurar el actual sistema educativo convencional basado en el aula. Las r{\'a}pidas transiciones al modo online ayudaron a mantener la continuidad de los programas educativos de optometr{\'i}a, encajando eficazmente en el prop{\'o}sito de completar el a{\~n}o acad{\'e}mico actual. La r{\'a}pida transici{\'o}n a la educaci{\'o}n en l{\'i}nea no s{\'o}lo ha beneficiado a los estudiantes de optometr{\'i}a, sino que tambi{\'e}n ha creado un impulso de educaci{\'o}n continua para los optometristas en ejercicio en el pa{\'i}s.},

Used by governments and other decision-makers in benefit--cost analysis for over a decade, SC-CO               2               estimates draw on climate science, economics, demography and other disciplines. However, a 2017 report by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine               1               (NASEM) highlighted that current SC-CO               2               estimates no longer reflect the latest research. The report provided a series of recommendations for improving the scientific basis, transparency and uncertainty characterization of SC-CO               2               estimates. Here we show that improved probabilistic socioeconomic projections, climate models, damage functions, and discounting methods that collectively reflect theoretically consistent valuation of risk, substantially increase estimates of the SC-CO               2               . Our preferred mean SC-CO               2               estimate is \$185\,per tonne of\,CO               2               (\$44--\$413\,per tCO               2               : 5\%--95\% range, 2020 US dollars) at a near-term risk-free discount rate of 2\%, a value 3.6\,times higher than the US government's current value of \$51\,per tCO               2               . Our estimates incorporate updated scientific understanding throughout all components of SC-CO               2               estimation in the new open-source Greenhouse Gas Impact Value Estimator (GIVE) model, in a manner fully responsive to the near-term NASEM recommendations. Our higher SC-CO               2               values, compared with estimates currently used in policy evaluation, substantially increase the estimated benefits of greenhouse gas mitigation and thereby increase the expected net benefits of more stringent climate policies.},

  abstract = {For any web or front-end developer, component generation is a manual and arduous process involving collaboration with designers. Components are the foundation upon which user interfaces (UI) are built, and generative AI is unlocking component creation for front-end developers, transforming a once arduous process, and aiding them in swiftly transitioning from idea to working components. By describing the interface they wish to build, developers can leverage openv0 to automatically produce Tailwind-powered UI code, using front-end frameworks like React \& Svelte, and component libraries such as NextUI, Shadcn, and Lucide. These automation capabilities significantly reduce the manual workload on designers and engineers, making the development lifecycle (idea -{$>$} software) more efficient and streamlined, making it easier for developers to bring their UI designs to life. Replit is at the forefront of this transformation with our integrated IDE, AI tools, runtime, and deployment environment. Putting the spotlight on ``openv0'' from @n-raidenai A Replit Builder in the community was inspired by rising interest in generative interfaces and decided to create an open-source version named openv0 - which makes use of plugins that integrate Replit ModelFarm. The platform supports iterative development, allowing for real-time adjustments and rapid prototyping. This level of automation not only speeds up the initial component generation, but also eases the burden of component maintenance, which traditionally requires a collaborative effort between designers and engineers to uphold design systems.}

Ocean acidification is close to being breached, while aerosol loading regionally exceeds the boundary. Stratospheric ozone levels have slightly recovered. The transgression level has increased for all boundaries earlier identified as overstepped. As primary production drives Earth system biosphere functions, human appropriation of net primary production is proposed as a control variable for functional biosphere integrity. This boundary is also transgressed. Earth system modeling of different levels of the transgression of the climate and land system change boundaries illustrates that these anthropogenic impacts on Earth system must be considered in a systemic context.           ,              Transgression of planetary boundaries by human activities have now brought humanity well beyond a ``safe operating space.''},

Their primary mission is to find out what customers ultimately will buy. One of the central premises of The Lean Startup movement is what Ries calls "validated learning" about the customer. It is a way of getting continuous feedback from customers so that the company can shift directions or alter its plans inch by inch, minute by minute. Rather than creating an elaborate business plan and a product-centric approach, Lean Startup prizes testing your vision continuously with your customers and making constant adjustments"--},

  abstract = {In an analysis of food system sustainability challenges and solutions among Swedish food system actors using Q-methodology, five perspectives were identified. One of the main three perspectives placed the highest priority on reduced meat consumption, food waste, and climate impact in agriculture, but downplayed strategies highlighted in the national food strategy and social aspects, and can be interpreted as a diagnostic climate mitigation-oriented perspective that does not reflect current negotiated policy processes or `softer' values of food. In an alternative regenerative perspective, industrialized large-scale farming and lack of internalization of external costs were regarded as the main problems, and diversity, soil health, and organic farming as the main solutions. Proponents of a third perspective regarded phasing out fossil fuels, increased profitability of companies, increased meat production, and self-sufficiency as high priorities. These contrasting views can be a major barrier to transforming the Swedish food system. However, a number of entry points for change (i.e. aspects highly important for some and neutral for others) were identified, including focusing on healthy diets and increased production of fruit and vegetables. Focusing on these can build trust among stakeholders before moving to discussions about the larger and more sensitive systemic changes needed.},

  abstract = {Environmental policy has paid more and more attention to the impact of products and their life cycle, by establishing goals to be reached very shortly. Decisions at the design stage have a significant impact on the downstream activities, easing or making them difficult, although these take place at a very later time. The paper presents an approach to include in the traditional design process environmental sustainability aspects next to functional and economic drivers. Its novelty stands in the support for companies to structure the acquired knowledge about sustainability; recently a growing number of industrial companies faced the environmental question, and now the problem is not related to the absence of environmental data, but to its effective capitalization and related scarce strategies to support and improve it. The method, starting from the company's data and information, identifies the best strategies to simplify and effectively support the decision-making process. In this way, it not only allows the designers to take advantage of the information coming from product life cycle phases but also it makes possible to lower the environmental impact of a product through their decisions. The output of the method consists of charts, maps, and graphical materials; using them designers can compare, in environmental terms, design alternatives. Different combinations can be analyzed and interpolated to select the best design combinations. The implementation in an industrial case of the method and its output allow its applicability and validation. Starting from environmental data collected by the company over the years, usually used by the marketing department, a critical review has been carried out to derive, from them, useful tools to be used during design choices.},

  abstract = {Aim Cancellation of university classes during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic challenges teaching inperson sexual history--taking skills to medical, physician assistant, and nursing students. We used commercial online electronic services for medical students to learn sexual history--taking skills. Methods A total of 174 medical students viewed a lecture on sexual history taking and the PLISSIT model (Permission, Limited Information, Specific Suggestion, Intensive Therapy) and were then randomized into dyads. They arranged a time to meet online on Zoom with their partner, chose a simple sexual history case-history (male or female) from a small selection, and recorded the 5- to 6-minute sexual history within a 1-week time frame. Each student played a ``provider'' or ``patient'' and then switched roles with a new case. One of the course tutors, all sexual health practitioners, downloaded 10 videos randomly assigned to them asynchronously and viewed and commented on the interaction of each ``provider'' along with comments on what to improve in the sexual history. 2~weeks later after the remainder of the lectures in the course, a second, more complex set of 8 cases were provided, so students could move at their comfort pace and choose~1. Main Outcome Measure Students were required to make 1 online post and 1 comment on another student's post for each case, on the experience, and associated issues arising, positive or negative. All comments were downloaded and analyzed by theme. Results Major themes included developing comfort in using sexual language, using simpler sexual terms suitable for patients, feeling confidence and mastery, excitement using technology developing clinical skills, surprise watching their performances and body language, observation of how they appeared to the ``patient,'' organizing sexual histories and incorporating PLISSIT model, ability to ask about context and relationships, and seeing the exercise as building on existing clinical skills training. Some expressed anxiety and nervousness, which by the second case had largely or completely dissipated. Conclusion A readily replicable, secure, cheap cloud-based model to integrate sexual history training asynchronously was provided, with tutors' comments, and student skills development, and performance evaluated.

  abstract = {Product design is one of the most important factors to introduce the circular economy model. In this discipline, the decisions made influence the whole life cycle of the product, since the raw material obtaining to the end of life of the product. Product engineering uses resources, both technical and material to create products. In this way, among all stages that product design encompasses, most relevant and significant decisions are taken during the conceptual stage, when changes can more easily be introduced. On the other hand, creativity plays an important role in introducing new features in products (as circularity is) in a new way. To implement in a proper manner these new functionalities in the products the concepts have to be evaluated. There are methods for assessing novelty and for assessing circularity, but in the case of circularity they are focused on products that have already been developed. Moreover, these methods do not assess circularity in a holistic way, as they only cover some of the aspects that the circular economy encompasses. This work intends to fill the gap that currently exists in the tools for evaluating product concepts by designing a metric, CN\textsubscript{C}on, that measures the circularity and the novelty of conceptual proposals as a whole. The metric works according the product functions and analysing the novelty, the strategies for durability and for extending the useful life of the product that the concepts use. It also assesses the raw material and the end of life of the materials with which the concepts are designed. The development of CN\textsubscript{C}on will help to implement the circular economy paradigm while encouraging creative design solutions.},

This is done in order to ensure that all citizens stay at home to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic including the closure of all workplace premises, schools and shops. It requires the changes in the daily routine from working at the office to work from home as well as dining in at the restaurants to food delivery. These significant changes have also affected academic institutions that need to devise alternatives to accommodate the shutdowns. The situation has also challenged the education system across the world and forces educators to shift from face-to-face to an online mode of teaching. Open and Distance Learning (ODL) method is one of the most suitable strategies that integrates virtual technology which consequently allows the continuation of the teaching and learning process. There are many tools available to provide online learning platforms. A user friendly and reliable technology is essential to ensure a successful online learning process. In some situations, the technology may neither seamless nor secure, and it can detract from the learning experience. A survey was conducted to identify the students' preference for their convenience in the adoption of online learning. The results of the study can be a reference for educators to make the most suitable tools as an option for the implementation of ODL.

  abstract = {Africa is one of the fastest growing mobile phone markets in the world with more than 630 million mobile subscribers and the lowest mobile penetration rate at 63.9\% (2014). It is experiencing an unprecedented growth in sectors such as health, education, agriculture and citizen participation thanks to mobile technology. Local developers and entrepreneurs with the right set of skills have an important role to play in the creation of mobile services solving local problems. However, very few multi-year capacity building initiatives on mobile app development exist in the region, and universities are often slow in offering new curricula. In this paper, we present and evaluate a model of teaching mobile app development that was implemented in Senegal and used in the last six years through the MobileSenegal project. We determined the impact of this capacity building effort on participants and the Senegalese tech ecosystem by administering a survey in year five, and systematically analyzing the mobile solutions they designed throughout the years. Our findings show that participants are trained with skills that are valuable in the Senegalese job market and MobileSenegal responds to a specific need in the Senegalese tech ecosystem that is not covered by other initiatives. Further directions of MobileSenegal and its sustainability are outlined.},

  abstract = {Groundbreaking language-vision architectures like CLIP and DALL-E proved the utility of training on large amounts of noisy image-text data, without relying on expensive accurate labels used in standard vision unimodal supervised learning. The resulting models showed capabilities of strong text-guided image generation and transfer to downstream tasks, while performing remarkably at zero-shot classification with noteworthy out-of-distribution robustness. Since then, large-scale language-vision models like ALIGN, BASIC, GLIDE, Flamingo and Imagen made further improvements. Studying the training and capabilities of such models requires datasets containing billions of image-text pairs. Until now, no datasets of this size have been made openly available for the broader research community. To address this problem and democratize research on large-scale multi-modal models, we present LAION-5B - a dataset consisting of 5.85 billion CLIP-filtered image-text pairs, of which 2.32B contain English language. We show successful replication and fine-tuning of foundational models like CLIP, GLIDE and Stable Diffusion using the dataset, and discuss further experiments enabled with an openly available dataset of this scale. Additionally we provide several nearest neighbor indices, an improved web-interface for dataset exploration and subset generation, and detection scores for watermark, NSFW, and toxic content detection.

  abstract = {Purpose-- The purpose of this article is to investigate whether management and employees in academic libraries involve users in library service innovations and what these user roles are.Design/methodology/approach-- The article first reviews the literature focusing on innovation, new product development, new service development and library science with specific focus on users and management. Subsequently the research uses a case study approach to investigate management and customer involvement in a Danish academic library.Findings-- Results from the case study show that academic libraries are making some attempts to draw on customers in service innovations and not only rely on management and employees. The main conclusion is that there are unexplored possibilities for customer involvement in library service innovations.Research limitations/implications-- One limitation relates to the difficulty of generalization of the findings to other Danish libraries and especially other national contexts. The other one relates to the preponderance of the literature from sources outside the field of library management and library science. Therefore, library managers might have to be cautious in using the results of this study.Practical implications-- The article has practical implications for library managers, employees, library science and innovation researchers alike.Originality/value-- The article is original because it generates new insights into management and especially customer involvement in academic library service innovations on the basis of an in-depth case study of a Danish academic library.}

  abstract = {Looking back to the rumours from the early 2000's, when the world of technology bloomed together with the curiosity towards what was next to come, by 2020, robots should have assisted and supported almost every task from our daily life. While this may seem as a Sci-Fi movie scenario, it is partially a tangible reality, that we quickly got used to, thanks to the introduction of smart speakers. As the world changes, so does the future of our students. In this respects, the evolution of the technology comes up with specific environments for educational purpose. Building smart learning environments supported by e-learning platforms is an important area of research in education domain within our days. The evolution of these smart learning environments is justified by some events (Covid19) that force students to learn remotely. The paper proposes a software application component using Alexa smart speaker, that integrates different services (Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Services) for a proper virtual environment platform, for both students and teachers. It addresses the main concerns of the current educational system, and provides a smart solution through the use of Artificial Intelligence based tools. The proposed approach not only achieves unifying data and knowledge-share mechanisms in a remotely mode, but it brings also a good learning experience, increasing the effectiveness and the efficiency of the learning process.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Customer satisfaction and reuse intention are fundamental to business success, no exception in digital business. Therefore, the purpose of the study is to determine the dimensions of mobile service quality and its effects on customer satisfaction and reuse intention. Gojek is selected as it is the first super app in the world at once the first ``decacorn'' company in Indonesia.  Methodology: This is a quantitative analysis approach explanatory test. The data were gathered using a purposeful sampling approach using an online questionnaire. The aim of this analysis is to evaluate data from 384 respondents using Warp Partial Least Square 6.0.  Main Findings: The result indicates that customer satisfaction directly influences content, program, and digital payment quality. The reuse aim often has a beneficial impact on knowledge efficiency, program functionality, and consumer service. Digital payment accuracy, nevertheless, has a marginal effect on reuse purposes. The finding also reveals that the consistency of the program is the main driver for consumer loyalty and reuse.  Implications/Applications: The analysis is critical because in the super application it illustrates quality factors. While the research refers to the Gojek super program, this analysis relates to customers' feedback and the plan to use it on mobile apps.  Novelty/originality of this study: This work is an early attempt to detect mobile quality factors that impact reuse in the super application. There is still limited research on the effects of quality mobile services in the super app. The research analyzed the standard of mobile services consisting of knowledge standard, device quality, and super-application digital payment efficiency. The research offered insight into the most significant variables that influence consumer loyalty and the ability to reuse.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            We assess evidence relevant to Earth's equilibrium climate sensitivity per doubling of atmospheric CO               2               , characterized by an effective sensitivity               S               . This evidence includes feedback process understanding, the historical climate record, and the paleoclimate record. An               S               value lower than 2~K is difficult to reconcile with any of the three lines of evidence. The amount of cooling during the Last Glacial Maximum provides strong evidence against values of               S               greater than 4.5~K. Other lines of evidence in combination also show that this is relatively unlikely. We use a Bayesian approach to produce a probability density function (PDF) for               S               given all the evidence, including tests of robustness to difficult-to-quantify uncertainties and different priors. The 66\% range is 2.6--3.9~K for our Baseline calculation and remains within 2.3--4.5~K under the robustness tests; corresponding 5--95\% ranges are 2.3--4.7~K, bounded by 2.0--5.7~K (although such high-confidence ranges should be regarded more cautiously). This indicates a stronger constraint on               S               than reported in past assessments, by lifting the low end of the range. This narrowing occurs because the three lines of evidence agree and are judged to be largely independent and because of greater confidence in understanding feedback processes and in combining evidence. We identify promising avenues for further narrowing the range in               S               , in particular using comprehensive models and process understanding to address limitations in the traditional forcing-feedback paradigm for interpreting past changes.                        ,              Plain Language Summary             Earth's global ``climate sensitivity'' is a fundamental quantitative measure of the susceptibility of Earth's climate to human influence. A landmark report in 1979 concluded that it probably lies between 1.5{$^\circ$}C and 4.5{$^\circ$}C per doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide, assuming that other influences on climate remain unchanged. In the 40~years since, it has appeared difficult to reduce this uncertainty range. In this report we thoroughly assess all lines of evidence including some new developments. We find that a large volume of consistent evidence now points to a more confident view of a climate sensitivity near the middle or upper part of this range. In particular, it now appears extremely unlikely that the climate sensitivity could be low enough to avoid substantial climate change (well in excess of 2{$^\circ$}C warming) under a high-emission future scenario. We remain unable to rule out that the sensitivity could be above 4.5{$^\circ$}C per doubling of carbon dioxide levels, although this is not likely. Continued research is needed to further reduce the uncertainty, and we identify some of the more promising possibilities in this regard.           ,              Key Points                                                                                     We assess evidence relevant to Earth's climate sensitivity                     S                     : feedback process understanding and the historical and paleoclimate records                                                                                             All three lines of evidence are difficult to reconcile with                     S                     ~{$<~$}2~K, while paleo evidence provides the strongest case against                     S                     ~{$>~$}4.5~K                                                                        A Bayesian calculation finds a 66\% range of 2.6--3.9~K, which remains within the bounds 2.3--4.5~K under plausible robustness tests},

  abstract = {"Economists have long based their forecasts on financial aggregates such as price-earnings ratios, asset prices, and exchange rate fluctuations, and used them to produce statistically informed speculations about the future--with limited success. Robert Shiller employs such aggregates in his own forecasts, but has famously complemented them with observations about the influence of mass psychology on certain events. This approach has come to be known as behavioral economics. How can economists effectively capture the effects of psychology and its influence on economic events and change? Shiller attempts to help us better understand how psychology affects events by explaining how popular economic stories arise, how they grow viral, and ultimately how they drive economic developments. After defining narrative economics in the book's preface with allusions to the advent of both the Great Depression and to World War II, Shiller presents an example of a recent economic narrative gone viral in the story of Bitcoin. Next, he explains how narrative economics works with reference to how other disciplines incorporate narrative into their analyses and also to how epidemiology explains how disease goes viral. He then presents accounts of recurring economic narratives, including the gold standard, real estate booms, war and depression, and stock market booms and crashes. He ends his book with a blueprint for future research by economists on narrative economics"--},

  abstract = {Introduction In the spot of the new emerging COVID-19 pandemic and its major impact worldwide on day-to-day activities many rules had to be changed in order to fight this pandemic. Lockdown started in Jordan and around the globe affecting several aspects of life including economy, education, entertainment, and government policies. Regarding education, the priority was to ensure the safety and progress of the educational process. Thus, new methods of teaching had to be applied using the online learning at Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST), Faculty of Medicine. This study was done to assess (1) Class Experience (2) Students and Lecturers' Interaction (3) Online Learning Advantages \& Disadvantages (4) Students' Preference. Methods A cross sectional study was conducted Convenience sampling technique was used to collect the data from the participants using a survey composed of 18 questions on Google Forms platform. A link was sent to the undergraduate medical students at the Jordan University of Science \& Technology via their e-learning accounts (n~=~3700). The form was available from May 22nd, 2020 to May 30th, 2020 for 8 days long. Data analysis was done using SPSS V 23. Results 2212 out of 3700 students responded, (55.8\%) of them were in the basic years and (44.2\%) of them were in the clinical years. (55.8\%) of students started to take online lectures after 3 weeks. (45.7\%) used the hybrid teaching method (asynchronous and synchronous), (31.4\%) used live classes, and 22.8\% recorded classes. Zoom was the most used platform. (48.7\%) and (57\%) of clinical students and basic students express their interaction as bad, while the others had good and excellent interaction. Maintaining social distance was the most advantage of online teaching, while poor technical setup and no direct contact were the most disadvantage, furthermore inability to have real clinical access was a significant problem for clinical students (p~{$<~$}.001). With reference to students' preferences 75\% of students were not pleased with their experience and 42\% of students prefer to integrate online learning with traditional learning. Conclusion Most medical students at JUST preferred the traditional face-to-face teaching method over the solo online teaching methods with recommendations to convert to a more integrated educational system. Also, a well-established infrastructure should be done in involving online teaching.},

  abstract = {Recent artificial intelligence (AI) systems have reached milestones in "grand challenges" ranging from Go to protein-folding. The capability to retrieve medical knowledge, reason over it, and answer medical questions comparably to physicians has long been viewed as one such grand challenge. Large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed significant progress in medical question answering; Med-PaLM was the first model to exceed a "passing" score in US Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) style questions with a score of 67.2\% on the MedQA dataset. However, this and other prior work suggested significant room for improvement, especially when models' answers were compared to clinicians' answers. Here we present Med-PaLM 2, which bridges these gaps by leveraging a combination of base LLM improvements (PaLM 2), medical domain finetuning, and prompting strategies including a novel ensemble refinement approach. Med-PaLM 2 scored up to 86.5\% on the MedQA dataset, improving upon Med-PaLM by over 19\% and setting a new state-of-the-art. We also observed performance approaching or exceeding state-of-the-art across MedMCQA, PubMedQA, and MMLU clinical topics datasets. We performed detailed human evaluations on long-form questions along multiple axes relevant to clinical applications. In pairwise comparative ranking of 1066 consumer medical questions, physicians preferred Med-PaLM 2 answers to those produced by physicians on eight of nine axes pertaining to clinical utility (p {$<$} 0.001). We also observed significant improvements compared to Med-PaLM on every evaluation axis (p {$<$} 0.001) on newly introduced datasets of 240 long-form "adversarial" questions to probe LLM limitations. While further studies are necessary to validate the efficacy of these models in real-world settings, these results highlight rapid progress towards physician-level performance in medical question answering.},

  abstract = {Background COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated mandatory e-learning in medical and nursing education. How far are developing countries like India (with wide socioeconomic and cultural diversity) geared up for this challenge remains unexplored. At this critical juncture, we aim to evaluate if online teaching methods are as feasible, acceptable, and effective as in-class teaching for medical/nursing students. Objectives The questionnaire captured: (1) practicability/feasibility of online classes, (2) health issues from online classes, (3) current methods for e-teaching, and (4) student attitudes and preferences. Design Cross-sectional survey. Settings Population-based study in India. Participants Nursing and medical undergraduate students (I-IV year). Methodology The online questionnaire was distributed to 200 medical and nursing colleges across India. Categorical variables were analyzed using chi-square tests. Binary logistic regression was done to analyze factors predicting health issues in students. p~{$<~$}0.05 was considered significant. Results Overall, 1541 medical and 684 nursing students completed the survey from 156 cities. The availability of laptop (p~{$<~$}0.0001), Wi-Fi (p~{$<~$}0.0001), dedicated room (p~{$<~$}0.0001), and computer proficiency was more in students of affluent families and those from cities (p~{$<~$}0.0001). Class duration {$>$}4~h/day (p~{$<~$}0.0001), each class {$>$}40~min (p~{$<~$}0.009) and pre-existing health issues (p~{$<~$}0.0001) predicted the occurrence headache, eyestrain, anxiety, neck/back pain, and sleep disturbance. Power-point presentation was the most widely (80\%) used method of teaching. Only 30\% got adequate time to interact with teachers. Only 20.4\% felt e-learning can replace conventional teaching. Students preferred: 3--6 classes/day, each class {$<$}40~min, 10--20~min break between classes and interactive sessions. Conclusion There is a need to improve information and communication infrastructure to enhance feasibility of e-learning for nursing/medical students in India. There should be guidelines (number of classes/day, length of each class, break between classes, curriculum, etc) to improve the retention capacity in students and reduce health issues. Continuous feedback from teachers and students will be required to make e-learning effective.},

Neural network training similarly involves iterating an update function (e.g. repeated steps of gradient descent), can result in convergent or divergent behavior, and can be extremely sensitive to small changes in hyperparameters. Motivated by these similarities, we experimentally examine the boundary between neural network hyperparameters that lead to stable and divergent training. We find that this boundary is fractal over more than ten decades of scale in all tested configurations.},

The analysis must be based on a dynamic approach to the economics of public policy, set in a complex, imperfect and uncertain world. The economics of climate change, and further, economics more broadly, must change to respond to the challenge of how to foster rapid transformation.

  abstract = {Stockholm Seminar with Kate Raworth (Oxford University's Environmental Change Institute) on 4 October 2017 at Stockholm Resilience Centre Economics is the mother tongue of public policy. It dominates our decision-making for the future, guides multi-billion-dollar investments, and shapes our responses to climate change, inequality, and other environmental and social challenges that define our times. Pity then, or more like disaster, that its fundamental ideas are centuries out of date yet are still taught in college courses worldwide and still used to address critical issues in government and business alike. That's why it is time, says renegade economist Kate Raworth, to revise our economic thinking for the 21st century.  In this seminar she will present ideas from her most recent book, Doughnut Economics, where she sets out seven key ways to fundamentally reframe our understanding of what economics is and does. Along the way, she points out how we can break our addiction to growth; redesign money, finance, and business to be in service to people; and create economies that are regenerative and distributive by design. Doughnut Economics offers a radically new compass for guiding global development, government policy, and corporate strategy, and sets new standards for what economic success looks like. *About Kate Raworth* Kate Raworth is a renegade economist focused on exploring the economic mindset needed to address the 21st century's social and ecological challenges, and is the creator of the Doughnut of social and planetary boundaries.   She is a Senior Visiting Research Associate at Oxford University's Environmental Change Institute, where she teaches on the Masters in Environmental Change and Management. She is also a Senior Associate at the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership.   Her internationally acclaimed idea of Doughnut Economics has been widely influential amongst sustainable development thinkers, progressive businesses and political activists, and she has presented it to audiences ranging from the UN General Assembly to the Occupy movement. Her book, Doughnut Economics: seven ways to think like a 21st century economist was published in the UK and US in April 2017 and is translated into Italian, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch and Japanese.}

It compares the performance of these alternative data sources with the performance of industry-accepted bureau income estimators that takes into account only financial system information; successfully showing that the alternative data manage to capture information that bureau income estimators do not. By implementing the TreeSHAP method for Stochastic Gradient Boosting Interpretation, this paper highlights which of the customer' s behavioral and transactional patterns within a Super-App have a stronger predictive power when estimating user' s income. Ultimately, this paper shows the incentive for financial institutions to seek to incorporate alternative data into constructing their risk profiles.},

While model providers in theory have a window into this impact via their users' data, both privacy concerns and practical challenges have made analyzing this data difficult. To address these issues, we present Clio (Claude insights and observations), a privacy-preserving platform that uses AI assistants themselves to analyze and surface aggregated usage patterns across millions of conversations, without the need for human reviewers to read raw conversations. We validate this can be done with a high degree of accuracy and privacy by conducting extensive evaluations. We demonstrate Clio's usefulness in two broad ways. First, we share insights about how models are being used in the real world from one million Claude.ai Free and Pro conversations, ranging from providing advice on hairstyles to providing guidance on Git operations and concepts. We also identify the most common high-level use cases on Claude.ai (coding, writing, and research tasks) as well as patterns that differ across languages (e.g., conversations in Japanese discuss elder care and aging populations at higher-than-typical rates). Second, we use Clio to make our systems safer by identifying coordinated attempts to abuse our systems, monitoring for unknown unknowns during critical periods like launches of new capabilities or major world events, and improving our existing monitoring systems. We also discuss the limitations of our approach, as well as risks and ethical concerns. By enabling analysis of real-world AI usage, Clio provides a scalable platform for empirically grounded AI safety and governance.},

  abstract = {The burgeoning financial technology scene in Singapore has seen the emergence of robo-advisors, which aim to disrupt traditional financial advisories by using algorithms to automate client advising and investment recommendations. Using an ecologies concept to explore how lay investors are articulated into global financial networks through robo advisors, this paper contributes to studies on the ``financialization of everyday life''. It argues that investors are rendered passive by the disciplinary tools of algorithms, contemporary finance theories and elements of robo-advisor platforms that feed into these sociotechnological assemblages. The state's role in embedding citizen investors in these human-machine relationships is considered. The fragmented landscape of free, nonprofessional online financial advice and the opaque qualities of investing algorithms make investor subject formation incomplete and uncertain, especially when markets are highly volatile. This paper explores how both financial inclusion and exclusion operate simultaneously in robo-advisors and argues that robo-advisors may weaken efforts to promote financial literacy and education.},

  abstract = {Amid the coronavirus outbreak, many countries are facing a dramatic situation in terms of the global economy and human social activities, including education. The shutdown of schools is affecting many students around the world, with face-to-face classes suspended. Many countries facing the disastrous situation imposed class suspension at an early stage of the coronavirus outbreak, and Asia was one of the earliest regions to implement live online learning. Despite previous research on online teaching and learning, students' readiness to participate in the real-time online learning implemented during the coronavirus outbreak is not yet well understood. This study explored several key factors in the research framework related to learning motivation, learning readiness and student's self-efficacy in participating in live online learning during the coronavirus outbreak, taking into account gender differences and differences among sub-degree (SD), undergraduate (UG) and postgraduate (PG) students. Technology readiness was used instead of conventional online/internet self-efficacy to determine students' live online learning readiness. The hypothetical model was validated using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The results revealed no statistically significant differences between males and females. On the other hand, the mean scores for PG students were higher than for UG and SD students based on the post hoc test. We argue that during the coronavirus outbreak, gender differences were reduced because students are forced to learn more initiatively. We also suggest that students studying at a higher education degree level may have higher expectations of their academic achievement and were significantly different in their online learning readiness. This study has important implications for educators in implementing live online learning, particularly for the design of teaching contexts for students from different educational levels. More virtual activities should be considered to enhance the motivation for students undertaking lower-level degrees, and encouragement of student-to-student interactions can be considered.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        A brain-computer interface that decodes continuous language from non-invasive recordings would have many scientific and practical applications. Currently, however, decoders that reconstruct continuous language use invasive recordings from surgically implanted electrodes             1--3             , while decoders that use non-invasive recordings can only identify stimuli from among a small set of letters, words, or phrases             4--7             . Here we introduce a non-invasive decoder that reconstructs continuous natural language from cortical representations of semantic meaning             8             recorded using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Given novel brain recordings, this decoder generates intelligible word sequences that recover the meaning of perceived speech, imagined speech, and even silent videos, demonstrating that a single language decoder can be applied to a range of semantic tasks. To study how language is represented across the brain, we tested the decoder on different cortical networks, and found that natural language can be separately decoded from multiple cortical networks in each hemisphere. As brain-computer interfaces should respect mental privacy             9             , we tested whether successful decoding requires subject cooperation, and found that subject cooperation is required both to train and to apply the decoder. Our study demonstrates that continuous language can be decoded from non-invasive brain recordings, enabling future multipurpose brain-computer interfaces.},

We focus on the issues performing in the classes, i.e., what is the major concern in illustrating the content of the teaching materials, how we arrange/design the issues for students' discussion and finally, the impact of these important issues (some of them are still in controversial and are subject of public concern). Briefly, there are four issues under which had been thoroughly reviewed:a. What has been taught during the devastating earthquake occurred in east Japan in Mar.11, 2011 after which caused huge nuclear disaster in Fukushima.b. The future of the fourth nuclear power plant which is now under construction in Gongliao, New Taipei City.c. The waddling of the policy of development of renewable energy in Taiwan, d. The evil of BOT (Building-Operation-Transferring) in the natural resort area of Taiwan.By appropriate choice of environmental issues, more instruction with environment conscience as well as sustainability could be addressed to the students.},

  abstract = {Microplastic pollution is increasingly recognised as a global environmental challenge which stems from the rapid growth of the use of petrochemical-derived plastic. As researchers and practitioners face a myriad of environmental challenges, oceanic microplastic pollution has so far dominated interest. However, airborne microplastics present an increasing environmental and public health concern. There is currently a need for research addressing this emerging challenge, and at the same time, the lack of knowledge and consensus regarding airborne microplastics presents an obstacle to action. The purpose of this study is to utilise a participatory Structured Decision-Making (SDM) approach to understand the perspectives of a range of stakeholders involved in the microplastics landscape, and subsequently refine common research priorities and knowledge gaps to advance the field. Through two participatory workshops, we first defined shared objectives of stakeholders and then negotiated best courses of action to achieve these objectives based on discussion between stakeholders and facilitators. The qualitative approach taken has enabled the full, complex and multidisciplinary aspects of the research into airborne microplastic pollution to be considered. Our findings highlight some important potential consequences of airborne microplastic pollution, including impacts on human health, and the need for more interdisciplinary research, and collaborative, integrated approaches in this area. As a result of the first workshop, five fundamental objectives on the theme of airborne microplastics were identified. As a direct consequence of this, participants identified 84 actions split across eight themes, which are outlined later in this paper.},

  abstract = {The prices of permits on the European Union's carbon market fell to {\texteuro}87 per tonne, the lowest in two months as investors anticipate less demand for permits due to a weak manufacturing sector. German industrial production declined 1.5\% from the previous month in July, surpassing market estimates of a milder drop and highlighting the impact that higher interest rates are having on European manufacturing after a batch of concerning PMI figures. In April, the European Parliament adopted climate measures aimed at reducing greenhouse emissions in the EU by 62\% by 2030 compared to 2005. The price of permits on the European Union's carbon market rose above {\texteuro}105 per tonne for the first time earlier this year, reflecting the growing costs that factories, power plants, and other industries have to bear for their pollution emissions. Historically, EU Carbon Permits reached an all time high of 105.73 in February of 2023. This page includes a chart with historical data for EU Carbon Permits.},

  abstract = {In order to lower the risks of large-scale landslides and improve community resilience in Taiwan, a long-term project has been promoted by the Soil and Water Conservation Bureau since 2017. In this study, methods to build an emergency response framework including hazard mapping and early warning system establishment were introduced. For hazard mapping, large-scale landslides were categorized into a landslide, debris flow, or landslide dam type based on the movement of unstable materials and topography. Each disaster type has different hazard zone delineation methods to identify the affected areas. After establishing the possible effected areas, early warning mechanisms, including warning value using rainfall as the indicator and evacuation procedures, should be created for emergency response. To set the warning value, analysis of the occurrence thresholds of previous existing large-scale landslides was conducted to determine the critical rainfall and further utilized to set the warning value considering the evacuation time for the locals. Finally, for integration with the current debris flow emergency response system, potential large-scale landslide areas were further divided into two types based on their spatial relationship with debris flows. For those overlapping with existing debris flow protected targets, the current emergency response system was upgraded considering the impact of large-scale landslides, while the others were suggested for use in building a new emergency response procedure. This integrated framework could provide a feasible risk avoidance method for local government and residents.},

  abstract = {At the heart of medicine lies the physician-patient dialogue, where skillful history-taking paves the way for accurate diagnosis, effective management, and enduring trust. Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems capable of diagnostic dialogue could increase accessibility, consistency, and quality of care. However, approximating clinicians' expertise is an outstanding grand challenge. Here, we introduce AMIE (Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer), a Large Language Model (LLM) based AI system optimized for diagnostic dialogue.  AMIE uses a novel self-play based simulated environment with automated feedback mechanisms for scaling learning across diverse disease conditions, specialties, and contexts. We designed a framework for evaluating clinically-meaningful axes of performance including history-taking, diagnostic accuracy, management reasoning, communication skills, and empathy. We compared AMIE's performance to that of primary care physicians (PCPs) in a randomized, double-blind crossover study of text-based consultations with validated patient actors in the style of an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE). The study included 149 case scenarios from clinical providers in Canada, the UK, and India, 20 PCPs for comparison with AMIE, and evaluations by specialist physicians and patient actors. AMIE demonstrated greater diagnostic accuracy and superior performance on 28 of 32 axes according to specialist physicians and 24 of 26 axes according to patient actors. Our research has several limitations and should be interpreted with appropriate caution. Clinicians were limited to unfamiliar synchronous text-chat which permits large-scale LLM-patient interactions but is not representative of usual clinical practice. While further research is required before AMIE could be translated to real-world settings, the results represent a milestone towards conversational diagnostic AI.},

  abstract = {The rapid advances of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are revolutionizing data science and statistics. These state-of-the-art tools can streamline complex processes. As a result, it reshapes the role of data scientists. We argue that LLMs are transforming the responsibilities of data scientists, shifting their focus from hands-on coding, data-wrangling and conducting standard analyses to assessing and managing analyses performed by these automated AIs. This evolution of roles is reminiscent of the transition from a software engineer to a product manager. We illustrate this transition with concrete data science case studies using LLMs in this paper. These developments necessitate a meaningful evolution in data science education. Pedagogy must now place greater emphasis on cultivating diverse skillsets among students, such as LLM-informed creativity, critical thinking, AI-guided programming. LLMs can also play a significant role in the classroom as interactive teaching and learning tools, contributing to personalized education. This paper discusses the opportunities, resources and open challenges for each of these directions. As with any transformative technology, integrating LLMs into education calls for careful consideration. While LLMs can perform repetitive tasks efficiently, it's crucial to remember that their role is to supplement human intelligence and creativity, not to replace it. Therefore, the new era of data science education should balance the benefits of LLMs while fostering complementary human expertise and innovations. In conclusion, the rise of LLMs heralds a transformative period for data science and its education. This paper seeks to shed light on the emerging trends, potential opportunities, and challenges accompanying this paradigm shift, hoping to spark further discourse and investigation into this exciting, uncharted territory.},

  publisher = {Routledge},
  address = {Abingdon, Oxon ; New York, NY},
  abstract = {"The book is a seminal contribution from a leading futurist who, over the past three decades, has explored each of the most disruptive forces shaping our world today, including emerging technologies, entrepreneurship, venture investments, and industrial manufacturing. Eco Tech brings all this thinking together, fusing insight from thought leaders with the author's own considerable experience, to explore scenarios for 2050 and discuss eco-effectiveness as an established practice for governments, corporations, startups, and individuals. Trond Undheim begins by providing a brief history of sustainability and provides simple definitions for key terms including eco-efficiency, life cycle analysis, industrial ecology, cleantech, net zero, climate change, biodiversity, and carbon capture, which will enable the reader to engage confidently in eco-discussions. Undheim also explores the ambitions of regeneration and offers a new conceptual framework to facilitate future discussion around sustainable innovation. He applies this framework to green, ambitious start-ups and examines the way these ventures will lead the way towards an eco-effective society, drawing on stories from exciting founders who are already changing the world. Finally, the book takes a deep dive into emerging eco-innovations, including batteries, bioplastics, distributed energy, space tech, and futuristic megaprojects. The book contains clear directions on how to progress through adversity and avoid returning to the status quo. The book will be an essential guide for executives, sustainability professionals and energy tech investors who are deeply concerned with the future and are prepared to both significantly invest in it and make behavioral changes to foster regenerative development. It will also be a great resource for students and scholars of sustainable investing and innovation"--},

  abstract = {Implementing ecodesign principles is key to success for the circular economy. Ecodesign is based on life cycle thinking. During the product development process the designer will think about the environmental impact of the new product for each phase of the life cycle, starting from the extraction of the raw materials, production of materials out of these raw materials, the production techniques to transform the materials into components, assembly of these components into products, the distribution and packaging of the products, the use phase (the impact of consumables and energy consumption), and finally the end of use phase by the consumer. The possibility of repair, upgrade, remanufacture of products and the improvement of the recyclability of the materials starts with the design of the product. Ecodesign guidelines support the designer making decisions during the product development process. The ecodesign guidelines are often classified as ``design for X'' approaches, where X stands for the different phase in the life cycle of the product. These ecodesign guidelines are brought together in ecodesign tools. Three of these qualitative ecodesign tools are presented in this chapter. To verify all these ecodesign guidelines, the designer will be informed by each partner in the value chain to look for the best compromise. The designer has a key role in the chain collaboration, which is necessary for the transition to the circular economy. The designer's aim is to, develop products and services that fit in the circular economy with the ecodesign principles as a guide. Ecodesign can be considered as the copilot during the product development process. The designer always looks for the best compromise between the ecodesign guidelines and the other requirements of the product (technical, economic, and human-related).},

In this paper I propose a definition of Sustainable AI; Sustainable AI is a movement to foster change in the entire lifecycle of AI products (i.e. idea generation, training, re-tuning, implementation, governance) towards greater ecological integrity and social justice. As such, Sustainable AI is focused on more than AI applications; rather, it addresses the whole sociotechnical system of AI. I have suggested here that Sustainable AI is not about how to sustain the development of AI per say but it is about how to develop AI that is compatible with sustaining environmental resources for current and future generations; economic models for societies; and societal values that are fundamental to a given society. I have articulated that the phrase Sustainable AI be understood as having two branches; AI               for               sustainability and sustainability               of               AI (e.g. reduction of carbon emissions and computing power). I propose that Sustainable AI take sustainable development at the core of its definition with three accompanying tensions between AI innovation and equitable resource distribution; inter and intra-generational justice; and, between environment, society, and economy. This paper is not meant to engage with each of the three pillars of sustainability (i.e. social, economic, environment), and as such the pillars of sustainable AI. Rather, this paper is meant to inspire the reader, the policy maker, the AI ethicist, the AI developer to connect with the environment---to remember that there are environmental costs to AI. Further, to direct funding towards sustainable methods               of               AI.},

  abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

In 2019, Alois M{\"u}ller GmbH in Allg{\"a}u opened their Green Factory in Ungerhausen, Germany. The Green Factory is a practically energy self-sufficient office and production building manufacturing heating and ventilation facilities as well as components for metal constructions. Over 200,000 solar cells on the roof provide two-thirds of the carbon-neutral electricity which is used directly onsite. Surplus electricity flows into the grid. Production steps are aligned with the quantity of electricity available. High-powered electrical machines such as the laser are prioritized when the PV facility provides enough electricity. The same applies to lacquer and sandblasting work as well as production entailing various mediums such as liquid nitrogen, purified water and compressed air. An important step toward carbon-neutral production is analyzing all material and energy flows required for manufacturing. An ERP system balances incoming orders and production data with the current weather prognoses. On days when there is not sufficient sunshine, the Green Factory draws its energy from a thermal power station. Additional energy is also supplied by a wood pellet boiler during extended cold periods.

  abstract = {Stress is an increasingly prevalent mental health condition that can have serious effects on human health. The development of stress prediction tools would greatly benefit public health by allowing policy initiatives and early stress-reducing interventions. The advent of mobile health technologies including smartphones and smartwatches has made it possible to collect objective, real-time, and continuous health data. We sought to pilot the collection of heart rate variability data from the Apple Watch electrocardiograph (ECG) sensor and apply machine learning techniques to develop a stress prediction tool. Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were used to model stress based on ECG measurements and stress questionnaire data collected from 33 study participants. Data were stratified into socio-demographic classes to further explore our prediction model. Overall, the RF model performed slightly better than SVM, with results having an accuracy within the low end of state-of-the-art. Our models showed specificity in their capacity to assess ``no stress'' states but were less successful at capturing ``stress'' states. Overall, the results presented here suggest that, with further development and refinement, Apple Watch ECG sensor data could be used to develop a stress prediction tool. A wearable device capable of continuous, real-time stress monitoring would enable individuals to respond early to changes in their mental health. Furthermore, large-scale data collection from such devices would inform public health initiatives and policies.},

It considers AI as a               General Purpose Technology               (GPT) and argues we need to investigate the power concentration of Big Tech. AI capitalism is characterised by the commodification of data, data extraction and a concentration in hiring of AI talent and compute capacity. This is behind Big Tech's unstoppable drive for growth, which leads to monopolisation and enclosure under the               winner takes all               principle. If we consider AI as a GPT---technologies that alter society's economic and social structures---we need to come up with alternatives in terms of ownership and governance. The commons is proposed as an alternative for thinking about how to organise AI development and how to distribute the value that can be derived from it. Using the commons framework is also a way of giving society a more prominent role in the debate about what we expect from AI and how we should approach it.},

  abstract = {The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), estimates that 75\% of crop diversity was lost since the 1900s. That lack of diversity presents a severe risk to the security of global food systems. Without seed diversity, it is difficult for plants to adapt to pests, diseases, and changing climate conditions. Genebanks, such as the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, are valuable initiatives to preserve seed diversity in a single secure and safe place. However, according to our analysis of the data available in the Seed Portal, the redundancy for some species might be limited, posing a potential threat to their future availability. Interestingly, the conditions to properly store seeds in genebanks, are the ones available in the freezers of our homes. This paper lays out a vision for Distributed Seed Storage relying on a peer-to-peer infrastructure of domestic freezers to increase the overall availability of seeds. We present a Proof-of-Concept focused on monitoring the proper seed storing conditions and incentive user participation through a Blockchain lottery. The PoC proves the feasibility of the proposed approach and outlines the main technical issues that still need to be efficiently solved to realize a fully-fledged solution.},

Actual energy consumption will be measured to explore benefits of energy-saving. The design origin for this building encompasses 13 green energy-saving techniques. United States Department of Energy dynamic building energy analytical software, eQUEST, is used to execute the strictest energy consumption analytical assessment. It is forecasted to reach an energy-saving efficiency of 65\% with energy use intensity (EUI) of 43 kWh/m(2).yr for the whole building, far below that of 169 kWh/m(2).yr found in Taiwan low/mid-rise office buildings. This building has begun operation in 2011, through actual readings from Building Energy Management System (BEMS) during January to June, first-half-year accumulated EUI of 19.3 kWh/m(2).yr against eQUEST analytical assessment of 22.5 kWh/m(2).yr for the same period. Actual energy consumption analysis for air conditioning, lighting, socket outlet, and power equipment, respectively recorded 41.7\%, 11\%, 22.3\%, and 25\% in June. Demonstrating that eQUEST analytical assessed value is very consistent with building's actual energy consumption readings. The energy consumption standard in the experimental research behind the Magic School of Green Technology stands at world class.}

By focusing on Ant Forest, this study attempts to explore the embedded gamification design to identify key elements that lead to users' long-term game participation which eventually fosters pro-environmental behaviors. First, a focus group interview was conducted to identify twenty-one gamification design elements in four modules: task design, social interaction, feedback, and reward. Furthermore, this study employed the Two-Dimensional Kano Model and better--worse analysis to classify and prioritize the gamification design elements that impact users' attitudes toward Ant Forest. Five Attractive elements, five One-Dimensional elements, four Must-Be elements, and seven Indifferent elements were identified in Ant Forest from 207 questionnaires. The results emphasize the significant impact of gamification design elements that are highly correlated with environmental sustainability (i.e., green context, pro-environmental behaviors, plant a tree) in Ant Forest. In addition, users who are rewarded by both virtual medals and official certificates demonstrate higher satisfaction, whereas elements associated with social interaction and competition show trivial importance. This study has profound theoretical implications as an interdisciplinary study, and yields helpful insights for practice to improve Ant Forest design, promote Ant Forest usage and finally fuel pro-environmental behaviors.},

Net-based learning has become an indispensable tool, and the distance learning system on campus has risen gradually. In order to promote distance learning more effectively, this study attempts to reveal the mentality of teachers, and proposes a willing-of-usage model as a reference for related researchers. Based on the verified TAM (Technology Acceptance Model) model, this study proposed a new model which considers the interface design, the functionality, information literacy, teacher background and organizational support as the external factors. In this study, questionnaires for college teachers around the country are collected on the Internet to understand the will of using distance learning. The data is analyzed using the SPSS and the method of SEM (Structural Equation Modeling). Both reliability and validity are analyzed, and the methodology of factor analysis and path analysis is used to verify the hypothesis and to understand the positive factors that affect the usage of distance learning platform. Structural Equation Models analysis revealed that the paths of the TAM model achieve the significant level, and degree of the model fitness was mostly good. The results showed that the system functionality and interface design only significant affect the degree of ease of use; the organizational support in schools affects the usefulness and ease of use; the information literacy and teacher background only affects usefulness. This study also found that in order to promote the willing of distance learning platform usage, it would be useful if school support such as teaching assistant and career training can be provided.},

The purpose of taking this initiative by Alipay is to make the world greener. This mobile application has motivated many users to plant millions of trees. However, minimal studies have been conducted to empirically disclose the factors that motivate Alipay users to participate in Ant Forest. A mixed-method approach is used to examine the factors influencing Alipay users to participate in Ant Forest and the level of satisfaction they got from it. The qualitative method was carried out through a structured questionnaire from 400 Alipay users and qualitative data from 20 users who have applied to Ant Forest and successfully planted trees. Additionally, alongside the mixed method employed to rationalize the relationship highlighted, a multiple regression model was employed to predict the value of a dependent variable (level of satisfaction) based on the value of several independent variables (namely, number of years engaged with Ant Forest activities, age, gender, profession, and education). The empirical results show that intrinsic motivations (enjoyment, social interaction, fulfilment, altruism) and extrinsic motivations (external rewards, competition) influence Alipay users to participate in the Ant Forest project. Further insights are presented in the concluding section for all stakeholders for environmental sustainability among the users of Alipay.},

  abstract = {Rising environmental issues are now a global concern, in part due to human behaviour which is generally not environmentally friendly in doing daily living activities such as littering, excessive vehicle use, wasteful resources consumption, combustion of fossil fuel, consume non-recyclable product and consume non-organic product. An emerged behavioural change approach known as ``nudging'' offers an insight to promote pro-environmental behaviour amongst people by influencing people's decisions with choice architecture. This paper aims to review the status quo of pro-environmental context in nudging for behaviour change and the nudging techniques that are available for selection to promote pro-environmental behaviour. PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework was adopted in this review. A total of 37 eligible articles were identified from acknowledged databases, Web of Science (WOS) and SCOPUS for inclusion of review. This review found that the majority of nudging studies show positive effects in nudging the targeted behaviour of people and demonstrate that the nudging technique has great potential to influence pro-environmental behaviour. Furthermore, this review presented seven types of nudging techniques (prompting, sizing, proximity, presentation, priming, labelling, functional design) which can be adopted for pro-environmental purposes. This paper provides an insight for pro-environmentalists and stakeholders into the usefulness of the nudging approach and how it can be applied in pro-environmental context. The concepts of implementation and recommendations for each nudging technique are described in this paper.},

The report can be found here: https://wikirateproject.org/Envisioni... The role of data and data-driven decision-making has become central to the supply chains and labor rights space. In tandem, the number of tools and initiatives working on these issues has multiplied. Despite strides made on supply chain transparency, the challenge remains that organizations tend to collect labor data in silos with only a few datasets shared between initiatives. This lack of interconnectedness is curbing the ability of organizations to achieve their common goal - that of improving the lives of workers in supply chains around the world. So, can there be an integrated and open data ecosystem for organizations working on labor rights in supply chains? In this webinar, we discuss research findings on the current challenges and opportunities that different types of organizations face for the use and leverage of labor data. We demystify key data concepts, techniques, and technologies that can be used for more and better data sharing; and make practical recommendations for the role you can play in this transformation, no matter where you sit on the data spectrum. Some of the questions that are covered: What does it mean to ``open up'' labor data? Can labor data be open? Where do I start?}

As an AI researcher with 25 years of experience, professor Mike Wooldridge has learned to be obsessively cautious about such claims, while still promoting an intense optimism about the future of the field. There have been genuine scientific breakthroughs that have made AI systems possible in the past decade that the founders of the field would have hailed as miraculous. Driverless cars and automated translation tools are just two examples of AI technologies that have become a practical, everyday reality in the past few years, and which will have a huge impact on our world. While the dream of conscious machines remains, Professor Wooldridge believes, a distant prospect, the floodgates for AI have opened. Wooldridge's A Brief History of Artificial Intelligence is an exciting romp through the history of this groundbreaking field--a one-stop-shop for AI's past, present, and world-changing future"--},

While these capabilities have led to widespread adoption, most LLMs are developed by resource-rich organizations and are frequently kept from the public. As a step towards democratizing this powerful technology, we present BLOOM, a 176B-parameter open-access language model designed and built thanks to a collaboration of hundreds of researchers. BLOOM is a decoder-only Transformer language model that was trained on the ROOTS corpus, a dataset comprising hundreds of sources in 46 natural and 13 programming languages (59 in total). We find that BLOOM achieves competitive performance on a wide variety of benchmarks, with stronger results after undergoing multitask prompted finetuning. To facilitate future research and applications using LLMs, we publicly release our models and code under the Responsible AI License.},

  abstract = {After several years of negative shocks, global growth is expected to hold steady in 2024 and then edge up in the next couple of years, in part aided by cautious monetary policy easing as inflation gradually declines. However, economic prospects are envisaged to remain tepid, especially in the most vulnerable countries. Risks to the outlook, while more balanced, are still tilted to the downside, including the possibility of escalating geopolitical tensions, further trade fragmentation, and higher-for-longer interest rates. Natural disasters related to climate change could also hinder activity. Subdued growth prospects across many emerging market and developing economies and continued risks underscore the need for decisive policy action at the global and national levels. Global Economic Prospects is a World Bank Group Flagship Report that examines global economic developments and prospects, with a special focus on emerging market and developing economies, on a semiannual basis (in January and June). Each edition includes analytical pieces on topical policy challenges faced by these economies.},

  abstract = {There are two sides to Svante Arrhenius's legacy with regard to climate change. He is known for having calculated the thermal effect of rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere over a hundred years ago. In that capacity, he can be said to be one of the founders of today's climate science. But Arrhenius is also remembered for an equation that bears his name that specifies how the rates of chemical reactions depend on temperature. The equation does not seem to be a part of mainstream climate science, but it has been taken up by some non-mainstream representatives to emphasize the role of degassing from the oceans. The equation, in their view, proves that human activities only account for about half the increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide, the rest coming from the oceans. Thus Arrhenius has been used both to construct today's mainstream climate theory and to underpin the critique against that theory. The dominant upholder of the mainstream theory, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and its opponents should recognise that there is a broader view of what Arrhenius can contribute to climate science.}

Our premiere model, VASA-1, is capable of not only producing lip movements that are exquisitely synchronized with the audio, but also capturing a large spectrum of facial nuances and natural head motions that contribute to the perception of authenticity and liveliness. The core innovations include a holistic facial dynamics and head movement generation model that works in a face latent space, and the development of such an expressive and disentangled face latent space using videos. Through extensive experiments including evaluation on a set of new metrics, we show that our method significantly outperforms previous methods along various dimensions comprehensively. Our method not only delivers high video quality with realistic facial and head dynamics but also supports the online generation of 512x512 videos at up to 40 FPS with negligible starting latency. It paves the way for real-time engagements with lifelike avatars that emulate human conversational behaviors.},

  abstract = {The historic Paris Agreement calls for limiting global temperature rise to ``well below 2 {$^\circ$}C.'' Because of uncertainties in emission scenarios, climate, and carbon cycle feedback, we interpret the Paris Agreement in terms of three climate risk categories and bring in considerations of low-probability (5\%) high-impact (LPHI) warming in addition to the central ({$\sim$}50\% probability) value. The current risk category of dangerous warming is extended to more categories, which are defined by us here as follows: {$>$}1.5 {$^\circ$}C as dangerous; {$>$}3 {$^\circ$}C as catastrophic; and {$>$}5 {$^\circ$}C as unknown, implying beyond catastrophic, including existential threats. With unchecked emissions, the central warming can reach the dangerous level within three decades, with the LPHI warming becoming catastrophic by 2050. We outline a three-lever strategy to limit the central warming below the dangerous level and the LPHI below the catastrophic level, both in the near term ({$<$}2050) and in the long term (2100): the carbon neutral (CN) lever to achieve zero net emissions of CO               2               , the super pollutant (SP) lever to mitigate short-lived climate pollutants, and the carbon extraction and sequestration (CES) lever to thin the atmospheric CO               2               blanket. Pulling on both CN and SP levers and bending the emissions curve by 2020 can keep the central warming below dangerous levels. To limit the LPHI warming below dangerous levels, the CES lever must be pulled as well to extract as much as 1 trillion tons of CO               2               before 2100 to both limit the preindustrial to 2100 cumulative net CO               2               emissions to 2.2 trillion tons and bend the warming curve to a cooling trend.},

Considering that interaction is based on perception, the study aims to examine whether machines have the same kind of perceived minds as humans, that is, how do machines differ from other human beings along the dimensions of mind perception - experience and agency. An online survey was conducted and recruited 522 respondents. The study found that we still see other human with more minds in both dimensions. However, machines in human-resemblance were perceived highest in both dimensions than other types of machines. Moreover, people familiar with technology in general tended to saw more agency and less experience among machines than those unfamiliar with technology.},

  abstract = {Ant Forest is an emerging mobile application platform that engages people in environment-friendly behavior with fragmented time and helps them cultivate ecological awareness and habit. Users grow virtual trees on the platform with the energy saved from daily low-carbon activities, and Ant Forest plants real saplings in desertified areas when the ``trees'' become big enough. Facilitating the public's participation in such green welfare, Ant Forest is a new-generation persuasive system with functions like social media and gamification. In addition to perceived persuasiveness in the existing literature, this study includes sense of achievement and perceived entertainment as extrinsic and intrinsic motivations, respectively, to explain people's continuous use of such a system and consequent behavior change. The results of a survey suggest that primary task support, perceived credibility, and perceived social support associated with Ant Forest positively affect the user's continuance intention through the mediation of perceived persuasiveness, sense of achievement, and perceiving entertaining. Furthermore, perceived persuasiveness and continuance intention lead to ultimate behavior change. The findings suggest the importance of both persuasive and motivational considerations in the implementation of new-generation persuasive systems to make them effective in the long run.},

  abstract = {People want to ``feel heard'' to perceive that they are understood, validated, and valued. Can AI serve the deeply human function of making others feel heard? Our research addresses two fundamental issues: Can AI generate responses that make human recipients feel heard, and how do human recipients react when they believe the response comes from AI? We conducted an experiment and a follow-up study to disentangle the effects of actual source of a message and the presumed source. We found that AI-generated messages made recipients feel more heard than human-generated messages and that AI was better at detecting emotions. However, recipients felt less heard when they realized that a message came from AI (vs. human). Finally, in a follow-up study where the responses were rated by third-party raters, we found that compared with humans, AI demonstrated superior discipline in offering emotional support, a crucial element in making individuals feel heard, while avoiding excessive practical suggestions, which may be less effective in achieving this goal. Our research underscores the potential and limitations of AI in meeting human psychological needs. These findings suggest that while AI demonstrates enhanced capabilities to provide emotional support, the devaluation of AI responses poses a key challenge for effectively leveraging AI's capabilities.},

  abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have in recent years demonstrated impressive prowess in natural language generation. A common practice to improve generation diversity is to sample multiple outputs from the model. However, there lacks a simple and robust way of selecting the best output from these stochastic samples. As a case study framed in the context of question generation, we propose two prompt-based approaches to selecting high-quality questions from a set of LLM-generated candidates. Our method works under the constraints of 1) a black-box (non-modifiable) question generation model and 2) lack of access to human-annotated references -- both of which are realistic limitations for real-world deployment of LLMs. With automatic as well as human evaluations, we empirically demonstrate that our approach can effectively select questions of higher qualities than greedy generation.},

This has become the greatest challenge of decade to deal with it. Globally, scientists and researchers were busy in finding a way to deal with this deadly pandemic. As this pandemic breaks out a huge demand for healthcare equipment, medicinal facilities has been rises and Industry 4.0 seems to be a hope during this pandemic which has potential to satisfy all these needs. In the battle, against this pandemic branches of computer science: Artificial Intelligence(AI), Internet of Things(IoT), Robotics, Machine Learning(ML) and Deep Learning(DL) played very important roles. Without the help of IoT and Robotics it would be impossible for frontline warriors to remain contactless with an infected person. Meanwhile, rapid testing, prediction of disease, sentiment analysis of population and many more would be only possible due to presence ML and DL algorithms. Undoubtedly, if this pandemichappened before the emergence of AI, IoT, ML, DL and Robotics; then the aftermath will surely be something else. This paper will highlight the contribution of these technologies in handling this pandemic from its treatment to management. This paper will give idea about the role of technologies, their affects, solutions provided by them, improvement needed in healthcare facilities, their role in managing sentiments of public during pandemic. The innovative part of this paper is that we are exploring each field of industry 4.0 and observing which plays the most important role.},

  abstract = {Internet memes are increasingly used to sway and manipulate public opinion. This prompts the need to study their propagation, evolution, and influence across the Web. In this paper, we detect and measure the propagation of memes across multiple Web communities, using a processing pipeline based on perceptual hashing and clustering techniques, and a dataset of 160M images from 2.6B posts gathered from Twitter, Reddit, 4chan's Politically Incorrect board (/pol/), and Gab, over the course of 13 months. We group the images posted on fringe Web communities (/pol/, Gab, and The\_Donald subreddit) into clusters, annotate them using meme metadata obtained from Know Your Meme, and also map images from mainstream communities (Twitter and Reddit) to the clusters. Our analysis provides an assessment of the popularity and diversity of memes in the context of each community, showing, e.g., that racist memes are extremely common in fringe Web communities. We also find a substantial number of politics-related memes on both mainstream and fringe Web communities, supporting media reports that memes might be used to enhance or harm politicians. Finally, we use Hawkes processes to model the interplay between Web communities and quantify their reciprocal influence, finding that /pol/ substantially influences the meme ecosystem with the number of memes it produces, while {\textbackslash}td has a higher success rate in pushing them to other communities.},

  abstract = {Recent work by Zellers et al. (2018) introduced a new task of commonsense natural language inference: given an event description such as "A woman sits at a piano," a machine must select the most likely followup: "She sets her fingers on the keys." With the introduction of BERT, near human-level performance was reached. Does this mean that machines can perform human level commonsense inference? In this paper, we show that commonsense inference still proves difficult for even state-of-the-art models, by presenting HellaSwag, a new challenge dataset. Though its questions are trivial for humans (\&gt;95\% accuracy), state-of-the-art models struggle (\&lt;48\%). We achieve this via Adversarial Filtering (AF), a data collection paradigm wherein a series of discriminators iteratively select an adversarial set of machine-generated wrong answers. AF proves to be surprisingly robust. The key insight is to scale up the length and complexity of the dataset examples towards a critical 'Goldilocks' zone wherein generated text is ridiculous to humans, yet often misclassified by state-of-the-art models. Our construction of HellaSwag, and its resulting difficulty, sheds light on the inner workings of deep pretrained models. More broadly, it suggests a new path forward for NLP research, in which benchmarks co-evolve with the evolving state-of-the-art in an adversarial way, so as to present ever-harder challenges.},

However, human distrust of AI is a critical factor that may impede human-AI cooperation. Although AI agents have been endowed with anthropomorphic traits, such as a human-like appearance, in prior studies to improve human trust in AI, it is still an open question whether humans have more trust in an AI teammate and achieve better human-AI joint performance if they are deceived about the identity of their AI teammate as another human. This research assesses the effects of teammate identity (``human'' vs. AI) and teammate performance (low-performing vs. high-performing AI) on human-AI cooperation through a human subjects study. The results of this study show that humans behaviorally trust the AI more than another human by accepting their AI teammate's decisions more often. In addition, teammate performance has a significant effect on human-AI joint performance in the study, while teammate identity does not. These results caution against deceiving humans about the identity of AI in future applications involving human-AI cooperation.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive success on many benchmarks for mathematical reasoning. However, there is growing concern that some of this performance actually reflects dataset contamination, where data closely resembling benchmark questions leaks into the training data, instead of true reasoning ability. To investigate this claim rigorously, we commission Grade School Math 1000 (GSM1k). GSM1k is designed to mirror the style and complexity of the established GSM8k benchmark, the gold standard for measuring elementary mathematical reasoning. We ensure that the two benchmarks are comparable across important metrics such as human solve rates, number of steps in solution, answer magnitude, and more. When evaluating leading open- and closed-source LLMs on GSM1k, we observe accuracy drops of up to 13\%, with several families of models (e.g., Phi and Mistral) showing evidence of systematic overfitting across almost all model sizes. At the same time, many models, especially those on the frontier, (e.g., Gemini/GPT/Claude) show minimal signs of overfitting. Further analysis suggests a positive relationship (Spearman's r{\textasciicircum}2=0.32) between a model's probability of generating an example from GSM8k and its performance gap between GSM8k and GSM1k, suggesting that many models may have partially memorized GSM8k.},

  abstract = {Using information technology tools for academic help-seeking among college students has become a popular trend. In the evolutionary process between Generation Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and traditional search engines, when students face academic challenges, do they tend to prefer Google, or are they more inclined to utilize ChatGPT? And what are the key factors influencing learners' preference to use ChatGPT for academic help-seeking? These relevant questions merit attention. The study employed a mixed-methods research design to investigate Taiwanese university students' online academic help-seeking preferences. The results indicated that students tend to prefer using ChatGPT to seek academic assistance, reflecting the potential popularity of GenAI in the educational field. Additionally, in comparing seven machine learning algorithms, the Random Forest and LightGBM algorithms exhibited superior performance. These two algorithms were employed to evaluate the predictive capability of 18 potential factors. It was found that GenAI fluency, GenAI distortions, and age were the core factors influencing how university students seek academic help. Overall, this study underscores that educators should prioritize the cultivation of students' critical thinking skills, while technical personnel should enhance the fluency and reliability of ChatGPT and Google searches and explore the integration of chat and search functions to achieve optimal balance.},

  abstract = {Generating realistic human motion from given action descriptions has experienced significant advancements because of the emerging requirement of digital humans. While recent works have achieved impressive results in generating motion directly from textual action descriptions, they often support only a single modality of the control signal, which limits their application in the real digital human industry. This paper presents a Motion General-Purpose generaTor (MotionGPT) that can use multimodal control signals, e.g., text and single-frame poses, for generating consecutive human motions by treating multimodal signals as special input tokens in large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we first quantize multimodal control signals into discrete codes and then formulate them in a unified prompt instruction to ask the LLMs to generate the motion answer. Our MotionGPT demonstrates a unified human motion generation model with multimodal control signals by tuning a mere 0.4\% of LLM parameters. To the best of our knowledge, MotionGPT is the first method to generate human motion by multimodal control signals, which we hope can shed light on this new direction. Codes shall be released upon acceptance.},

OmChat's new architecture standardizes how different visual inputs are processed, making it more efficient and adaptable. It uses a dynamic vision encoding process to effectively handle images of various resolutions, capturing fine details across a range of image qualities. OmChat utilizes an active progressive multimodal pretraining strategy, which gradually increases the model's capacity for long contexts and enhances its overall abilities. By selecting high-quality data during training, OmChat learns from the most relevant and informative data points. With support for a context length of up to 512K, OmChat demonstrates promising performance in tasks involving multiple images and videos, outperforming most open-source models in these benchmarks. Additionally, OmChat proposes a prompting strategy for unifying complex multimodal inputs including single image text, multi-image text and videos, and achieving competitive performance on single-image benchmarks. To further evaluate the model's capabilities, we proposed a benchmark dataset named Temporal Visual Needle in a Haystack. This dataset assesses OmChat's ability to comprehend temporal visual details within long videos. Our analysis highlights several key factors contributing to OmChat's success: support for any-aspect high image resolution, the active progressive pretraining strategy, and high-quality supervised fine-tuning datasets. This report provides a detailed overview of OmChat's capabilities and the strategies that enhance its performance in visual understanding.},

  abstract = {By conditioning on natural language instructions, large language models (LLMs) have displayed impressive capabilities as general-purpose computers. However, task performance depends significantly on the quality of the prompt used to steer the model, and most effective prompts have been handcrafted by humans. Inspired by classical program synthesis and the human approach to prompt engineering, we propose Automatic Prompt Engineer (APE) for automatic instruction generation and selection. In our method, we treat the instruction as the "program," optimized by searching over a pool of instruction candidates proposed by an LLM in order to maximize a chosen score function. To evaluate the quality of the selected instruction, we evaluate the zero-shot performance of another LLM following the selected instruction. Experiments on 24 NLP tasks show that our automatically generated instructions outperform the prior LLM baseline by a large margin and achieve better or comparable performance to the instructions generated by human annotators on 19/24 tasks. We conduct extensive qualitative and quantitative analyses to explore the performance of APE. We show that APE-engineered prompts can be applied to steer models toward truthfulness and/or informativeness, as well as to improve few-shot learning performance by simply prepending them to standard in-context learning prompts.

  abstract = {網際網路型態轉變，社群媒體蔚為風潮，社群用戶高速的互動串聯也掀起了一波「網路迷因」(Internet Memes)風潮，企業品牌及政府機關單位紛紛相中網路迷因的高分享力特性，進而將網路迷因視為社群行銷的主要策略手段。過去，網路迷因的相關研究皆專注於定義與現象；近年來雖始有學者針對網路迷因的影響力作為研究主題，但鮮少針對分享網路迷因的動機以及其訊息傳遞方式進行探討研究。 本研究為探討社群使用者對網路迷因之分享意圖，以理性行為理論(Theory of Reasoned Action, TRA)為基礎，檢視社群使用者對不同網路迷因特質的感知，即「幽默性」、「病毒性」與「地獄梗」，是否影響內在因素，如「享樂價值」、「功利價值」、「社會價值」與「道德判斷」以及外在因素-「主觀規範」，並進而透過此內、外在信念影響個人網路迷因分享意圖。本研究透過模擬Facebook情境進行實驗問卷設計，蒐集737位網路閱聽人的問卷填答資料進行分析與驗證。主要研究結果如下：(1)幽默性、地獄梗特質之網路迷因圖文對分享意圖有正、負向影響；(2)幽默性特質之網路迷因對享樂價值、功利價值、社會價值、與主觀規範有正向影響，並進而影響其分享行為意圖；(3)地獄梗特質之網路迷因對享樂價值、功利價值、社會價值、與主觀規範有負向影響，並進而影響其分享行為意圖。本研究的研究結果可作為實務界網路迷因行銷手法之參考，賦予企業品牌及政府組織網路迷因的創作方向，增加其被分享傳遞之績效。在學術上，本實證研究也進一步擴展理性行為理論之應用，並從價值態度與主觀規範等內、外在心理因素解釋民眾分享網路迷因之行為意圖，補足過去研究之不足。},

  abstract = {Above and beyond the casual relationships that are present with everyday consumption, collected objects that are consciously and purposely chosen indicate that a relationship exists between individuals and the objects. Drawing on in-depth interviews conducted with collectors who share a strong interest in what could be considered, in a monetary sense, low value objects, this research finds that culture and its presence in society play a strong role on influencing collecting decisions and can determine what objects hold more meaning than others.             Compared to a framework consisting of four retro-branding constructs of allegory (brand story), aura (brand essence), arcadia (idealised community), and antinomy (brand paradox) ( Brown et al., 2003 ), data reveal that an additional construct, which is termed ardour, could be added. Ardour greater construes the passion and enthusiasm that collectors feel for a brand, principally because of its relation to their own country, through the symbolism of the designs, and essentially the brand's ethos.},
