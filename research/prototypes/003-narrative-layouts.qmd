# Narrative Layouts

How should the layout storyline be structured? Well it’s like Strava (that running app) for sustainability… or if you have heard of Welltory. I believe if I spent 5 minutes every day with a guide who could help me make more eco-friendly choices that would improve my life.. be it what I consume, save, invest, etc.. so I’m trying to design an app around this idea.
