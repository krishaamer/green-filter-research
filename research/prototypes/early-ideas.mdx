# Early Feature Ideas

The following early prototypes are focused on particular feature ideas
that occurred to me during the literature review process. They are naive
and meant to allow thinking in terms of *what-if* a particular user
experience was possible. These prototypes were not tested with users
directly and formed a basis for directing the questions asked in a
potential user survey.

# Susan (Sustainability Conversation)

*What if* I could have a chat like this at the supermarket? Imagine what
questions I would ask before buying a product. AI: “Kris, do you still
remember Coca Cola’s packaging is a large contributor to ocean plastic?
You even went to a beach cleanup!” Me: “That’s so sad but it’s tasty!”
AI. “Remember your values. Would you like to start saving for investing
in insect farms in Indonesia instead? Predicted return 4% per year,
according to analysts A and B.” If I’m not so sure, I could continue the
conversation. Me: “Tell me more” AI: “A recent UN study says, the planet
needs to grow 70% more food in the next 40 years. Experts from 8
investment companies predict growth for this category of assets.” Me:
“Thanks for reminding me who I am” … Moments later. AI: “This shampoo is
made by Unilever, which is implicated in deforestation in Indonesia
according to reporting by World Forest Watch. Would you consider buying
another brand instead? They have a higher ESG rating.”

Example Suggestions of the AI companion:

-   “Don’t buy a car, use a car sharing service instead to save XYZ CO2.
    Service available near you: Bolt,\* Uber.”

-   “Use a refillable shampoo bottle to save XYZ plastic pollution”

-   “Call your local politician to nudge them to improve bicycle paths
    and reduce cars in your neighborhood. Over the past 2 years, you
    city has experienced an increase of cars from 290 cars per capita to
    350 cars per capita.”\*

Figure 3: Speculative scenario of an interaction between a human user
and a robo-advisor through the interface of chat messages in the context
of retail shopping for daily products.

## Sunday Market

*What if* I could go to the Sunday market with other people who care
about sustainability? First prototype (based on literature review)
called HappyGreen’s for going to the organic Sunday Market with friends.
Choose industries of focus? Fashion, Food, etc?

## True Cost

*What if* I you could see the actual cost of each product including
externalities?

## Speak Truth to Power

*What if* I could affect companies with truth? Consolidate user feedback
for companies.

## How Far?

*What if* I knew how far did this product travel to reach me?

## Country Profiles

*What if* I knew my country’s top pollution sources?

## Know Your Company

*What if* I could KYC the companies I interact with? Like the banks KYC,
consumers can KYC.

## CO2e Flex

*What if* I could show off how much CO2e I have retired?

## Sustainability Watch

*What if* I could see all my sustainability data on a wearable device in
the right context?

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[0] }} />

## Narrative Layouts

*What if* I spent 5 minutes every day with a guide who could help me
make more eco-friendly choices? How should the layout storyline be
structured? Well it’s like Strava (that running app) for sustainability…
or if you have heard of Welltory. I believe sustainable choices that
would improve my life.. be it what I consume, save, invest, etc.. so I’m
trying to design an app around this idea. I’m basically building the UX
of AI.. focused on sustainability. How should the layout storyline be
structured? Well it’s like Strava (that running app) for sustainability…

## Shopping Divest

*What if* I you could build a community based on what I buy?

## Books Can Talk

*What if* sustainability literature could chat with me? Books can now
talk to me. My bedtime story about shopping, saving, and investing.
