1 may prof suggestion - make connection between biodibersity and
production and consumption clearer - what is the incentive for companies
to share their data?

my own idea: like the switch of going from traditional banking with ATM
machines on the street (or even the physica bank office) to online
banking with mobile payments

-   hypothesis: esg accessibility can push companies to increase
    production standards

-   what if you can see ESG in near-realtime such as the stock market
    price

-   i can imagine esg derivative product like siemens gamesa

-   ai can help integrate esg derivatives into daily life to drive esg
    adoption

-   “effective altruism (EA)”

-   “Blockchain technology can improve price transparency in product
    distribution by allowing consumers to know the exact pricing from
    raw materials to distributors to suppliers.”

-   

Interviews and testing survey were conducted anonymously in hopes to
have more honest responses from the responders.

-   ziran chrome extension is unable to record activity due to browser
    security restrictions for plugins
-   ai.ziran.tw record user activity
-   semi-structured interviews were conducted in chinese
-   the interviewer (me) took notes of the interviews
-   some gaps in the data exist due to the limited chinese language
    skills of the interviewer (me)

basic interview script - momo: what is a brand that you like’d or would
like to buy - search - please pick a product (or search again) - on
product page: what do you notice on this page? - what kind of
information is important for you on this page? - do you notice anything
else - (if the user doesn’t notice the green filter, direct their
attention to it and ask: what do you think this does?) - would you click
on it - if the user says yes, continue - if thhe user says no, make note
and continue - as the extension generates a response: what do you think
about this content? - is there any information that you consider
important? - anything else you see that you think looks special - do you
see anywhere you can click? - would you click on it? - if yes,
continue - if no, make note, and continue - explain: due to the
limitation of the prototype, the test will continue on a separate page
where you can ask questions - is there anything you would like to ask
the helper? - notice if the user picks from sample questions - remind
the user they can come up with their own question - as the ai is
generating content ask: do you see any information in this content - did
you know this before or is there any info you didn’t know before? make
note. - front page: explain the helper takes into account your personal
info and goals. - ask: what kind of information do you think important
to share with the helper?

-   Doesn’t understand investing (Understands it’s Taiwanese stocks) so
    the helper is useful for explaining new concepts

-   DJmoney
