## Testing Period

-   1 month from 2024 April 2 to May 2, 2024
-   30 individual participants
- semi-structured interviews based on a prepared script
- duration between 5-15 minutes per participant

Testing participants were sourced from the primary anonymous survey participants (at the end of the survey respondents had the option to enter a separate form, disconnected from the survey, where they could leave their contact information, which 20 people did.)

I actively approached fellow students in diverse locations on the NCKU campus and asked them to test my thesis app.

Testing was conducted anonymously to encourage participants spreak freely without fear of their opinions being recorded with their identity.
