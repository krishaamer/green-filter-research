# Introduction

In 1896, the Nobel Prize winner Svante Arrhenius calculated how an increase in CO~2~ levels could have a warming effect on our global climate [@andersonCO2GreenhouseEffect2016;@wulffPetterLegacy2020]. 120 years later, the Paris Agreement came into effect, with countries agreeing on non-binding targets on how to keep CO~2~ levels 1.5 °C below pre-industrial levels [@unitednationsParisAgreement2016]. In August 2018, Greta Thunberg skipped school to start a climate strike in front of the Swedish parliament Riksdag; millions of people around the world joined her Fridays for Future protests and Time magazine named Thunberg person of the year for *creating a global attitudinal shift* [@deutschewelleFridaysFutureGlobal2019]. 

While awareness of Earth's warming climate was growing, the CO~2~ emissions kept rising too. The hockey-stick growth of CO~2~ concentration since the industrial revolution is clear in the data from 1958 onward, following a steady annual increase, called the *Keeling Curve* [@keelingAtmosphericMonthlySitu2017]. Written records of global temperature measurements are available starting from the 1880s when documentation of temperatures become available in ship records [@BrohanClimate2012]. Temperature estimations from tree-trunks allow some temperature comparisons with the climate as far back as 2000 years ago [@rubinoLawDomeIce2019].

In 1938, Guy Stewart Callendar was the first to demonstrate the warming of Earth's land surface as well as linking the production of fossil fuels to increased CO~2~ and changing climate [@hawkinsIncreasingGlobalTemperatures2013]. By the latest data from 2022, the current world population of 8 Billion people emitted 37.5 gigatonnes of CO~2~ per year, the highest emissions recorded in history [@statistaAnnualCO2Emissions2023]. To limit global warming to 1.5 °C as agreed by the world nations in Paris, removal of 5-20 gigatons of CO~2~ per year would be needed according to reduction pathways calculated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [@wadeMoisturedrivenCO2Pump2023]. Yet, most countries are missing the mark. Given this model of climate change, the G7 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, United States) are heading for 2.7 °C of warming by 2050 [@cdpMissingMarkCDP2022]. The monumental task of removing several gigatons of CO~2~ from the atmosphere requires massive policy shifts and collaboration across countries and industries [@macklerPolicyAgendaGigatonscale2021].

Not discounting the enormity of emissions, yet it's not the only massive problem humanity is facing. In January 2022, the Stockholm Resilience Centre reported that we have breached 4 out of our 9 planetary boundaries: in addition to climate change, biodiversity loss, specifically Extinctions per Million Species per Year (E/MSY), land-system change (deforestation, land degradation, etc), and biogeochemical flows (the cycles of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, etc) ; from the positive side, fresh water use, ocean acidification and stratospheric ozone depletion are within planetary limits while atmospheric aerosol loading and the biodiversity intactness index (BII) have not yet been fully quantified [@perssonOutsideSafeOperating2022].

### Biodiversty Loss

Protecting biodiversity

| What Happened?                                | How Much?                  |
|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Vertebrate species population average decline | 68% over the last 50 years |
| Land surface altered by humans                | 70% of Earth               |
| Vertebrate species extinct                    | 700 in 500 years           |
| Plant species extinct                         | 600 in 500 years           |
| Species under threat of extinction            | 1 million                  |

: Biodiversity loss data from [@bradshawUnderestimatingChallengesAvoiding2021].

-   The current environmental upheaval, led by Gen-Z and Millennials, and the business adaptation (or lack thereof) to sustainable economic models, taking into account the hidden social and environmental costs we didn't calculate in our pricing before.
-   We also need to consider environmental effects (E in ESG). We haven't taken into account the whole cost of production, leading to the wrong pricing information. To achieve this, we need expert governance (G).

Consumer lifestyle contributes to environmental destruction. According to @ellenmacarthurfoundationmaterialeconomicsCompletingPictureHow2019's models show 45% of CO~2~ equivalent emissions come from our shopping; produced by companies to make the products we consume. A large scale study by @anthonyleiserowitzInternationalPublicOpinion2022 on Meta's Facebook (n=108946) reported people in Spain (65%), Sweden (61%), and Taiwan (60%) believe "climate change is mostly caused by human activities". An even larger survey (n=1.2 million) by the United Nations across 50 countries, distributed through mobile game ads, showed the majority of people agreeing climate change is an "emergency" @undpPeoplesClimateVote2021. While people express eco-conscious ideas, it's non-trivial to practice sustainability in daily life. @deyangeorgievGenStatisticsWhat2023 reports only 30% of people in the Gen-Z age group believe technology can solve all problems.

| Age Group | Agree | Neutral or Disagree |
|-----------|-------|---------------------|
| 18-35     | 65%   | 35%                 |
| 36-59     | 66%   | 34%                 |
| Over 69   | 58%   | 42%                 |

: "Climate change is an emergency" @undpPeoplesClimateVote2021.

The theme for this year's Earth Day was *"Invest In Our Planet"* @earthdayEarthDay20232023 and it's very apt as @MappingGapRoad2016 estimates the global financing gap for low-carbon energy production in 2016 was 5.2 Trillion USD. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) calculates the world needs an additional 4.1 Trillion USD of financing in nature by 2050 to meet climate change, biodiversity, and land degradation targets [@unepUNEPGreenFinance2022]. And according to @therockefellerfoundationWhatGetsMeasured2022 a slightly lower 2.5-3.2 Trillion USD would be sufficient. In any case, even with massive financing going into sustainability, there's still a lack of investing, and it's not happening fast enough. The lack of funding in green energy especially affects emerging economies, reminds us @MobilizingCapitalEmerging2022. "We can and must channel private capital into nature-based solutions. This will require policy and regulatory support, catalytic capital and financial innovation" said the CEO Green Finance Institute, Dr Rhian-Mari Thomas, ahead of COP27 in Egypt [@GreenFinanceInstitute2023].

However, the needed investment doesn't seem so large, coming in at 2.5-5.2 % of the global GDP, if we compare it to the *per year* Global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) estimated at around 100 Trillion USD in 2022 and growing to 105 Trillion USD in 2023 [@aarononeillGlobalGDP198520282023; @IMFWorldEconomicOutlook2023]. In essence, the estimated total investment gap in climate fits into the economic growth of 1 year of the global economy.

## Research Relevance

This research is timely in 2023 because of the convergence of five trends:

| Trend                                                                                      |

| Young people demand for sustainability                                                     |
| Intergenerational money transfer to Millenials; relatively young people have money         |
| Appearance of sustainability metrics and instruments such as ESG, B Corp, Green Bonds, etc |
| Technology adoption and AI-based user interface availability                               |

: Current trends backing the relevance of this research project.

**There's evidence young people have money.** In the U.S. alone, the combined annual consumer spending of Gen-Z and Millennials was over 2.5T USD in 2020 [@ypulseMillennialsGenTeens2020]. Over the coming decade, in the U.S., UK, and Australia, Millennials are inheriting 30T USD from their parents [@calastoneMillennialsInvestingDetailed2020]. There's also some evidence of investment interest, however there's large geographic variance. According to a @calastoneMillennialsInvestingDetailed2020 study (n=3000) surveying people in the Millennial age group between ages 23 and 35 in Europe (UK, France, Germany), U.S.A., Hong Kong, and Australia, 48% of respondents located in Hong Kong owned financial securities (such as stocks) while the figure was just 10% in France.

| Place     | Percentage |
|-----------|------------|
| Hong Kong | 48%        |
| France    | 10%        |
|           |            |

## Defining the Problem Space

Does individual climate action help?

-   [Gen-Z college students (target users) may not have the capital to make a financial dent today however they can be early adopter and they will be the decision-makers in a few years.]{.underline}
-   "Like climate change, the focus on individual actions as a solution is often misplaced, though it remains a focus of media and industry. For decades, the petrochemical industry has offloaded responsibility onto individuals through promoting concepts such as the"carbon footprint", championed in a 2004 advertising campaign by British Petroleum" [@cherryProfitRethinkingCorporate2010 in @laversFarDistractionPlastic2022].
-   Individual efforts are too small to matter unless they're inspired by Community a effort

## Research Background

I grew up reading science fiction books and their influence on my outlook towards future possibilities continues until present day. Star Trek has a portable device called a ***tricorder*** (fig. 1), which enables imaginary future humans fix all kinds of problems from scanning for minerals inside a cave to scanning human bodies for medical information. I would love to have such a device for consumer choices and financial decisions - to know what to buy and which businesses to do business with. Robots are already integral part of our lives; this thesis proposal was partially written using Google's and Apple's Voice recognition software, allowing me to transcribe notes with the help of an AI assistant.

As a foreigner living in Taiwan, I've relied extensively on Google Maps' AI assistant to move around efficiently, including to find food and services, when writing in Chinese, Apple's text prediction algorithms translate pinyin to 漢字. Even when we don't realize it, AI assistants are already helping us with many of our mundane tasks. While it takes incredibly complex computational algorithms to achieve this in the background, it's become so commonplace, we don't even think about it. From this point of view, another AI assistant to help us with greener shopping decisions, saving CO~2~, and investing in more eco-friendly businesses doesn't sound so much of a stretch.

## Research Motivation

-   This research takes place at the intersection of Taiwanese college students, sustainability, finance, AI, and design.

For the average person like myself, my experience with money is mostly limited to buying things at the supermarket. Food, clothes, furniture, soap, mobile phone. This leaves very few options on how to start with something new like saving and investing.

-   Could the Green Supermarket become the entry point to Green Savings and Green Investing?
-   Oboarding more people for sustainable practices is a complex interaction design issue hindered by ambiguous data (what is sustainable?) and messy human motivations (we love buying things).
-   What can people who want to preserve Earth's environment, exactly do? How can networks of people come together?
-   Health tracking apps paired with connected devices such as Apple Watch filled with sensors provide one model for simple interactions to dynamically track digital health data - also known as a quantified self. This data allows apps to provide tips how to improve health outcomes through small daily actions such as climbing more stairs. Small interactions allow users to align their goals with their actions.
-   What would be a good interface to track sustainability? What is the user interface at scale, useful for billions of people?
-   One way to influence societal outcomes is to decide where to put our money. While our financial decisions are a vote towards the type of businesses we want to support, is it enough?
-   While some people are demanding sustainability, and some governments and companies are announcing green investment opportunities, how can consumers discover the most suitable investment options for their situation?
-   How can retail investors access and differentiate between eco-friendly sustainability-focused investable assets?
-   The level of knowledge of and exposure to investing varies widely between countries and people.
-   Could linking green consumption patterns with sustainable investing provide another pathway to speed up achieving climate justice as well as personal financial goals?
-   In this simplified scenario, I'm in a physical offline store, doing some shopping. When putting a bottle of Coca Cola in my basket, my ***AI companion Susan*** will ask me a personalized question:

## Research Objective

The study presents an AI companion design which seeks to help people build relationships with sustainability-focused companies. The major contribution of this study is an interactive artefact (a prototype) informed by design research.

It seems impossible to know which company is more sustainable than the other. We don't really know what's green, unless we spend a lot of time looking at the data. Environmental issues are caused by production and manufacturing processes of the companies that make the products we consume on a daily basis. The companion enables people to be more transparent and responsible in their consumption behavior.

My interest lies in understanding how AI assistants can help conscious consumers become sustainable investors. The purpose of this study is to explore how to provide the best user experience to potential sustainable financial AI companion users. In their sustainability report every company looks perfect. How can people shop, save and invest sustainably? Where does our money go and what are some greener alternatives?
