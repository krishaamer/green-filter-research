# Discussion

## 5.1. Expected Findings
During the preparation of this research proposal, I conducted a preliminary round of face-to-face interviews using 21 open-ended probing questions using a convenience sampling of NCKU students on campus between ages 19 and 29, a total of 12 respondents. The interviews lasted between 9 and 21 minutes and were conducted to get some initial feedback on my research idea, the respondents' daily routines, app usage, feelings towards financial questions, including investing, relationship with nature, and environmental sustainability. These preliminary conversations led me to emphasize more on the financial journey, i.e., to consider the importance of the shopping, savings, and payments apps students already use daily, which could serve as an entry point to becoming an investor. I expect my future research findings to confirm this initial idea and offer diverse ways and examples of what that path could look like in practice.

## 5.2. Research Limitations
First, finance is a highly regulated industry and the proposed user experience designs may be limited by legal requirements. This study does not take such limitations into account, rather focusing only on the user experience.
Second, the research is concerned with respondents in Sweden and Taiwan and excludes people in other countries. One of the questions from early discussions was the applicability of these findings in lower-income countries. This question remains an opportunity for further study and is not addressed here.
Finally, ESG needs data to give us an accurate understanding of the realities inside companies and the user experience design does not address the underlying data quality problem further than by providing a link to the data source.

## 5.3. Conclusions
After the completion of this study, the conclusions will be reported here.
