# Discussion


## 5.2. Research Limitations
First, finance is a highly regulated industry and the proposed user experience designs may be limited by legal requirements. This study does not take such limitations into account, rather focusing only on the user experience.
Second, the research is concerned with respondents in Sweden and Taiwan and excludes people in other countries. One of the questions from early discussions was the applicability of these findings in lower-income countries. This question remains an opportunity for further study and is not addressed here.
Finally, ESG needs data to give us an accurate understanding of the realities inside companies and the user experience design does not address the underlying data quality problem further than by providing a link to the data source.

## 5.3. Conclusions
After the completion of this study, the conclusions will be reported here.
