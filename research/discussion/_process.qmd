## Design Process

Designing for Taiwanese college students requires developing and understanding of who they are - as individuals and as part of groups. User research makes extensive use of user *personas* to represent a group of people with similar attributes. Designers use personas to *articulate assumptions,* which, if used well, is useful for *user-centered design*, to create better products. Personas help to reflect on what kind of *biases* might exist in the design. Within the larger cohort of college students several different personas could be defined, for example grouping people by interests, knowledge, habits, levels of anxiety, and other attributes. Humans have a long list of cognitive biases, which a good design should take into account.

Many general observations could be made, for example:

-   Students ride bicycles and scooters.
-   Students live in dorms and shared housing, meaning their impact per square meter is low.
-   Circular economy services such as YouBike are available in Taiwan and used by a portion of the students.

However, to create more meaningful personas, personas should be more specific and backed up with data. In the following chapter I will describe in detail the process of designing Green Filter.

### Design Inspiration

As discussed in the literature review AI section, Replika was one of the inspirations for the Green Filter.

```
### Pollution Exposure Tracking

Another inspiration was from a device for tracking air pollution. Pollution exposure tracking may be considered a combination of health tracking and sustainability tracking. I've been tracking my personal air pollution exposure using the ATMO Atmotube Pro device attached to my backpack.

```{python}
#| label: fig-air-pollution-personal
#| fig-cap: "My Personal Exposure to Air Pollution"
#| fig-scap: "My Personal Exposure to Air Pollution"
air_chart()
```

The above charts shows my exposure to pollutants while traveling, ranked from worst to best. My worst exposure to air pollution was in Saudi Arabia, while Taiwan ranks the 3rd.

## Persona-Based App Features

The following features match the 3 personas shown in the Results section.

## Disregarded Features

These type of social features universally received the lowest preference scores from all the personas.

-   Social Network, group challenges & leaderboards (TPB: subjective norms)

-   “Eco Friends” feed to connect classmates

I can't explain why social features scored so low. My own expectation was these type of features would be popular. This phenomena certainly deserves more attention and research to explain and disprove the findings.
