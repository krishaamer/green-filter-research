In the following tables I've used the *Theory of Planned Behavior* to categorize each feature according to what psychological state they aim to affect. To have a chance to impact human behavior towards sustainability, the nudges should be delivered in-context, and at the right time, using effective language.

        "Third, up-to-date ESG data is expensive and thus couldn't directly be used in this research.
