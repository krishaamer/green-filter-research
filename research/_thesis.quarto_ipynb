        "As of 2025, Earth's natural environment is being heavily degraded by the extractive business practices of companies that make many of the products and services we buy every day. The emerging field of *planetary health* recognizes profound interconnections between our economic behaviors, ecosystem services such as clean water, air, soil, the climate crisis, and human health. The way we use money to interact with companies - through shopping, or saving and investing - impacts the life-supporting biosphere we depend on. In essence, from an ecological perspective, every financial action is either an investment decision to support more environmentally-friendly companies - or to support polluters. \n",
        "\n",
        "In Taiwan, college students are concerned with environmental issues, yet lack simple tools to effectively influence systemic change towards sustainable outcomes. Concurrently, in the European Union, new environmental policies include the concept of *digital product passports (DPPs)*, which aim to facilitate tracking data across the entire product lifecycle, from source materials, until the consumer purchase decision, and finally post-purchase recycling, building *transparency* into opaque global supply chains. These new digital tools hold the potential to benefit from *data-driven interaction design*, *large-language models*, and *AI agents* to translate complex environmental data into human-comprehensible language. If successful, DPPs may help to solve the *attitude-behavior gap* by making it easy to distinguish *eco-designed products* made by circular economy companies, striving to be *zero waste*, from those merely engaged in *greenwashing*.\n",
        "\n",
        "My research focuses on college students and addresses the need for tools to make sustainable financial action more convenient. I leverage *design research* to find design concepts for *simple AI-based generative user interfaces* to help young adults participate in *sustainable financial activism*. Throughout the process, I conducted a survey of over 900 students from 20 universities across Taiwan, face-to-face user testing with 30 participants, and 6 expert interviews providing industry insights. The major contribution of the study is an interactive AI-assistant prototype.\n",

        "\n",
        "I grew up as an avid science fiction reader, which influenced my outlook towards future possibilities. In particular, the Star Trek universe had an imaginary portable device called a ***tricorder*** (fig. 1) enabling scientists to scan anything for insights. Be it precious minerals inside a cave or scanning the human bodies for medical data, its sensors would show up with some useful data. In daily life, I would love to have such a device for consumer choices and financial decisions - to know what to buy and which businesses to support with my money and approval.\n",

        "```\n",
        "While a *tricorder* is still science fiction, technological advancements are getting closer and closer to producing something similar. AIs are already integral to many parts of our lives, with computer models producing increasingly useful outputs. The proposal for this thesis was first written using Google's and Apple's voice recognition software in 2020, and later switching to OpenAI's *Whisper* model, allowing me to transcribe notes with the help of an AI assistant. As a foreigner living in Taiwan since 2019, I relied on AI-based tools for many aspects of my life: speaking, moving, finding food and services. When writing in Chinese, Apple's text prediction algorithms translate pinyin to 漢字 and show the most likely character based on my previous writing, Google's maps find efficient and eco-friendly routes and recommend places to eat and ChatGPT provides statistically probable advice from the sum of human knowledge. Even when we don't realize it, AI is helping us with many mundane tasks. While it takes incredibly complex computational algorithms to achieve all this in the background, it's become so commonplace, we don't even think about it. From this point of view, another AI assistant to help students with choosing more eco-friendly businesses - to shop, save, and invest - doesn't sound so much of a stretch.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Motivation\n",
        "\n",
        "Environmental degradation is increasingly affecting human lives - and it's largely driven by manufacturing processes - of the products we consume daily. From resource extraction in the linear economy (mining raw materials and drilling for fossil fuels) to chemical processes (causing contamination and pollution of the air, water, and soil) to waste generation and greenhouse gas emissions, industries transform the natural world into consumer products. While industry practices have improved since the industrial revolution in the 19th century, and continue to improve, it's possible to further improve standards of production and raise the global baseline for sustainability, given enough societal pressure to do so.\n",
        "\n",
        "Nonetheless, without easily accessible and reliable data, it's difficult to know which company is more sustainable than another. As consumers and investors (even if only through passive ownership of savings), we don't really know much about enterprise production practices, unless we spend a lot of time looking at the numbers, which may be costly to access (for example ESG reports are expensive), and mostly rely on our governments and international bodies to keep us safe. Or just look at the brands themselves - and pick the ones which we like.\n",

In addition, both Confucianism and Daoism, the prevalent belief systems in Taiwan, affect education to be *teacher-centered*, where traditionally the role of students is to listen and absorb knowledge; in today's society, there's space to open opportunities for revisiting *dialogue-based* education, where students would be encouraged to take a more active role and gain ownership of their education [@changExploringDialogicEducation2023].\n",

This particular field of sustainability study is now known as *sustainable yield of natural capital*.

Given these varied ideas for over 300 years, I believe some percentage of people have been concerned with our planet's natural environment and its preservation already for centuries.

Janine Benyus, who coined the word *Biomimicry* [@benyusBiomimicryInnovationInspired2009] looks at very practical cases of innovation where engineers and biologist meet and [@dicksBiomimicryRevolutionLearning2023] provides a much more philosophical account of following the example of nature. Focusing on the financial sector, [@thomasDesignFinancialSustainability2022]'s philosophical account advocates for an \"inside-out\" design pattern, much like natural systems, starting from the smallest structures to guarantee resilience and survival, instead of trying to control their external environment. In a similar vein, *Material Ecology* is the wording preferred by the architect Neri Oxman based at the MIT Media Lab working with biomaterials as a proponent of *Nature-Centric Design* that adheres to the principles of ecological sustainability with both an ecologically conscious mindset and practical toolset [@henczNeriOxmanMaterial2022]. Language and our mental concepts shape our reality, which makes language-creation an important tool for sustainability. Neri Oxman's expressions in her [@worldeconomicforumBioInspiredDesignNeri2016] interview introduce some new vocabulary: *\"ecology-indifferent\"*, *\"naturing\"*, *\"mother naturing\"*, *\"design is a practice of letting go of all that is unnecessary\"*, *\"nature should be our single client\"*, which reminds me how self-invented language gives un child-like freedom to imagine new worlds.\n",

Multi-species design and participatory design can work together. [@haldrupDesigningMultispeciesCommons2022] examines how participatory design can include non-human species as co-creators of the urban commons; drawing on cases from Copenhagen, Denmark and the Viskan River (in the textile town, Borås, Sweden), the authors highlight sensory and aesthetic encounters, and attempts to perceive the agency of non-human species in a collaborative design processes [@theuniversityofmelbourneaustraliaMultispeciesCohabitationFuture2020].

A very practical example helps one visualize this field the best. [@kosovaBioGeoEcotileImproving2023] introduces the BioGeo Ecotile, a eco-engineering tile combining pits, holes, grooves, and crevices to mimic natural rocky shores and provide multi-species living-environments; deployed on rock armor and flood walls along Edinburgh’s coast in Scotland, Ecotiles supported significantly higher intertidal species richness compared to smooth tiles, helping animals make a life there. [@selvanMultispeciesBuildingEnvelopes2023] goes deep into data modeling multi-variate calculations on how to build buildings, which support ecology, coming up with a general framework for the architecture of building envelopes, that resulted in 20% higher local species richness and up to 77% higher abundance for individual species.\n",

        "In most cases, designing for sustainability makes use of *systems thinking*, underlining the importance of looking at the entire life-cycle of a product or service. [@ROSSI2022823] shows how introducing sustainability early in the design process and providing scenarios where sustainability is a metric, it's possible to achieve more eco-friendly designs. Yet, calculating what's sustainable is hugely complex because decisions may have unforeseen ramifications. To take a single example [@NUEZ2022133252] shows how electric vehicles may increase CO~2~ emissions in some areas, such as Canary Islands, where electricity production is polluting. In sum, sustainable design encompasses all human activities, making this pursuit an over-arching challenge across all industries and all human activities with the complex interdependence contained within these interactions. [@engkvistWhyArenThere2024] calls for *Design Sociology*, design should take account the product's effect on society, giving the example of highly individualized understanding of individualized psychology and dopamine cycles for creating social media, while disregarding the societal effects, such as spread of misinformation.

First introduced by [@dunneSpeculativeEverythingDesign2013] in their seminal book, the field aims to question the intersection of *user experience design* and *speculative fiction*. [@BARENDREGT2021374] explores the potential of speculative design to stimulate public engagement; thought experiments can spur public debate on an issue chosen by the designer. Phil Balagtas, founder of The Design Futures Initiative at McKinsey, discusses the value of building future scenarios at his talk at Google. His favorite example, the Apple Knowledge Navigator, first appeared in an Apple vision video in 1987 and took two decades to materialize in the real world. It was inspired by a similar device first shown in a 1970s episode of Star Trek as a *magic device* (a term from participatory design), which then inspired subsequent consumer product development. It took another two decades, until the launch of the iPhone in 2007 - a total of 40 years. Iteration has been the mainstay of software design, incrementally improving the user experience, through a continuous feedback loop; yet speculative design can help explore and imagine possible futures by manifesting them in stories, artifacts, and scenarios, empowering stakeholders to prepare for challenges and shape policy, as well as ethical frameworks, beyond strictly product-centered thinking [@googledesignDesignSpeculativeFutures2019].\n",

For both speculative and participatory design, the cost and makes it into a niche activity. Generative AI holds the promise to allow designers to dream up and prototype quicker. In order to build a future, it's relevant to imagine and critique a future. By being quickly generate prototypes, once can test out ideas with the future users involving more of the community and stakeholders. To be able to build something, one first needs to imagine it; imagination is crucial for change. Speculative Design helps us envision future scenarios and be critical of the current reality, by taking an alternative view-point. A related field, *Design Fiction*, goes even further by creating narratives and artifacts that immerse participants in detailed visions of possible futures, blending storytelling and tangible experiences. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is a source of many fantastic innovations, used to host The Design Fiction group (from September 2013 to May 2018), which designed projects to *\"stimulate discussion about the social, cultural, and ethical implications of emerging technologies\"*, coming up with design such as a Brain-Controlled Interface for Spermatozoa, the Human Perfume, capturing the smell of the people significant to the author, as well as Pop Roach, for designing edible cockroaches [@liuOverviewBrainControlledInterface2017; @designfictiongroupGroupOverviewDesign2018].\n",

The world is filled with structures: nature, cultures, languages, human interactions - all form intricate patterns. Computer systems are increasingly capable in their ability copy these patterns into computer models - known as machine learning. As of 2023, 97 zettabytes (and growing) of data was created in the world per year [@soundaryajayaramanHowBigBig2023]. Big data is a basic requirement for training AIs, enabling learning from the structures of the world with increasing accuracy. Large data-sets such as the LAION-5B of 5.85 billion image-text pairs, were foundational for training AI to recognize images [@romainbeaumontLAION5BNEWERA2022; @schuhmannLAION5BOpenLargescale2022]. Just 3 years later, *generating* images with GenAI models is now fast enought to create images in real-time while the user is typing [@dwarkeshpatelMarkZuckerbergLlama2024]. Similarly huge data-sets exist about other types of media - and the open Internet itself, albeit less structured, is a data-source frequently scraped by AI-model builders. Representations of the real world in digital models enable humans to ask questions about the real-world structures and to manipulate them to create synthetic experiments that may match the real world (if the model is accurate enough). This can be used for generating human-sounding language and realistic images, finding mechanisms for novel medicines as well as understanding the fundamental functioning of life on its deep physical and chemical level [@nopriorsInceptiveCEOJakob2023].

Alan Turing's Test for Machine Intelligence followed in 1950. Turing's initial idea was to design a game of imitation to test human-computer interaction using text messages between a human and 2 other participants, one of which was a human, and the other - a computer. The question was, if the human was simultaneously speaking to another human and a machine, could the messages from the machine be clearly distinguished or would they resemble a human being so much, that the person asking questions would be deceived, unable to realize which one is the human and which one is the machine?

However, open-source AI-models have opened up the avenue for smaller companies and even individuals for creating new AI-assistants - perhaps using the same underlying foundation model as the base, but adding new data, abilities, tools, or just innovating on the UI/UX stack. An explosion of personal AI assistants powered by foundation models can be found across use-cases. The following table only lists a tiny sample of such products.\n",

It's very common for children to imagine stories and characters in play - it's a way to develop one's imagination *learn through roleplay*. A child might have toys with human names and an imaginary friend and it all seems very normal. Indeed, if a child doesn't like to play with toys, we might think something is wrong. Likewise, inanimate objects with human form have had a role to play for adults too. Anthropomorphic paddle dolls have been found from Egyptian tombs dated 2000 years B.C.

[@seanmcgowanUXDesignFinTech2018] offers four guidelines for fintech apps: (1) understand domain complexities, (2) friction is necessary for safety - embrace it, (3) provide continuous and clear feedback, and (4) simplify complex financial information - this can build user confidence and reduce errors. [@cordeiroDesignNoLonger2016] emphasizes designing for the \"unhappy path\" - negative experiences can shape users’ perception deeply, as bad memories carve strongly in their user experience - products which handle failures and edge cases gracefully, however, stand out and maintain satisfaction. [@robindhanwaniFintechUIUX2021] approaches UX problems from an organizational perspective, noting that in large organizations, UX issues can stem for lack of alignment between teams; the authors propose *Design Jams* as a potential solution to improve cross-team collaboration - design jams are cross-functional workshops, which can help teams align on user needs, generate rapid prototypes, and iteratively refine interfaces - which, in theory, could improve the adherence to the guidelines above noted.\n",

(Unless they have inherited wealth or are among the very few who work in institutions such as investment firms, university endowments, pension funds or mutual funds, and have a say in where to invest large amounts of other peoples' money.) Retail investors face many challenges in comparison with their institutional counterparts. For instance, they may have much less time to do proper research, face information asymmetries, where finding good information is limited by time, ability, as well as financial literacy, whereas professional investors have the tools, skills, time, and knowledge, to make better investment decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "The common expectation is that young investors typically have less understanding financial concepts. While consumers are beginning to become more money-savvy, they still lag in both financial and sustainability literacy. Financial and sustainability literacy are intertwined. Integrating these literacies is essential, because a financially informed public is better equipped to channel capital toward environmentally beneficial uses. Media plays a significant role here, with retail investing being heavily influenced by social media influencers.\n",

For the majority of people, savings are invested by the bank and make up the largest proportion on investments for the people who are not active investors themselves.

If retail investors act in aggregate, the reputational effect needs further research. *\"To halt climate change, some investors have decided to divest from fossil fuel companies.

        "\n",
        "My purpose for the first qualitative stage is to explore the general themes arising from the literature review related to the design of AI advisors for investing. I identifed specific user experience factors, through interviewing experts in financial technology and user experience design and reviewing existing applications on the marketplace. At this stage in the research, the central concept being studied was defined generally as expectations towards a sustainable investment AI advisor.\n",
        "\n",
        "I started with literature review, which led into expert interviews (there were many questions arising from the literature). I identified key concepts from expert discussions and gained exposure to their industry insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "The qualitative research methods employed in the first stage of the research design enables me to explore concepts arising for literature review further, using a more open approach, without limiting the conversation only to pre-ascribed notions. The strength of the qualitative approach in the first stage is to encourage the discovery of new ideas, not yet common in literature and potential user experience factors related to sustainable investing and user experience.\n",

        "#### Sampling\n",
        "\n",
        "My qualitative sampling structure used non-probability snowball sampling, with the following criteria: targeting financial industry, fintech, design, and sustainability experts; located everywhere.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Methods\n",

        "I conducted exploratory research in English using semi-structured interviews recorded online and offline. I talked to 5 experts over video call and 1 one expert face-to-face; all interviews were conducted in English. I recorded audio and video, transcribed the conversations, and then performed thematic analysis of the contents, leading to a *wish list* of features.\n",

        "I then proceeded to the second, quantitative stage, informed by the previously identified factors, and prepared a survey to understand potential users' preferences, including a Likert scale, a choice experiment, and a selection of proposed features, focusing on the preferences of the potential users in gen-z, aged 18-29, living in Taiwan, exploring the relationship between independent variables: - \"Interest in Sustainability\" - \"Interest in Investing\" - \"Preferred Features\" - and the dependent variable \"User Sign-ups\".\n",

        "#### Sampling\n",
        "My quantitative sampling structure uses a judgmental criterion: adults aged in Generation-Z (18-29), located in Taiwan, surveyed using a Chinese-language online survey.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Methods\n",
        "Likert: The survey includes a Likert scale between 1 to 5 to validate key findings from the first stage of the research by assessing responses to statements regarding the app's design, features, and other criteria that may still emerge. \n",

        "Choice Experiment: The survey includes a *choice experiment* between different sets of potential features available when communicating with the sustainable finance AI companion.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Survey Development and Expected Findings\n",
        "\n",
        "In December 2020, in preparation for the final version of the survey, I ran a preliminary questionaire, testing open-ended and close-ended questions, as way to prepare for the proposal of this research. I conducted a preliminary round of face-to-face interviews using 21 open-ended, probing questions and a convenience sampling of NCKU foreign students (n = 12) on campus between ages 19 and 29. The interviews were conducted in English and lasted between 9 and 21 minutes; they gave me some initial feedback on my research idea, the respondents' daily routines, app usage, and feelings towards financial questions, including investing, relationship with nature, and environmental sustainability \n",
        "\n",
        "This preliminary version of the survey was only used to develop the questionaire itself and the data collected (even though the recorde audio was transcribed), is not part of the research results. These preliminary conversations led me to emphasize more on the financial journey of the user, i.e. to consider the importance of the shopping, savings, and payments, with the apps students already use daily, serving as an entry point to becoming an investor (this approach later became known as embedded finance). I expected my future research findings to confirm this initial idea and to offer diverse ways and examples of what that path could look like in practice.\n",
        "\n",
        "I then proceeded to change my target audience to Taiwanese students and developed the survey to include more specific questions, including more close-ended multiple-choice varieties.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Final Survey: Data Collection\n",
        "\n",
        "For the actual survey, I developed 63 close-ended and open-ended questions. For survey distribution, I adopted a face-to-face method to increase response rates, distributing flyers to students on college campuses, canteens, and classrooms, getting verbal permission from educators in their classrooms to distribute the survey flyer. Similarly to the approach take by [@liuDigitalCapabilityDigital2023], I distributed the survey flyer at universities located in the Northern, Soutern, Central, and East regions of Taiwan. The flyer included a colorful AI-generated visual with a futuristic game-like female figure, and the title \"climate anxiety survey\" in Chinese, as well as a website link (ziran.tw) and scannable QR-code. \n",

Here my focus was on operationalizing the gathered insights into a prototype that users can experiment with. I designed and refined a prototype of the personal sustainable finance AI assistant. I used face-to-face interviews to discuss the prototype, and conducted a thematic analysis of the discussions' recordings, leading to further validation of previously gathered data and changes in the prototype.
