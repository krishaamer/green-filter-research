        "Taiwanese college students are concerned with environmental issues, yet they are hindered by lack of simple tools to affect systemic change. Meanwhile, on the other side of the Planet, strengthening environmental policy from the European Union includes the concept of *digital product passports*, which aims to help distinguish *eco-designed* products made by *circular economy* companies striving to be zero-waste from companies that simply engage in *greenwashing*. Tracking product data from the source materials until the consumer purchase and finally post-purchase recycling, combined with *data-driven interaction design* facilitates building transparency into opaque global supply chains by using *large-language models* and *artificial intelligence assistants* to translate complex environmental data into human-comprehensible language.\n",

As of 2024, Earth's natural environment is being heavily degraded by the extractive business practices of companies that make many of the products and services we buy every day. The way we use our money to interact with companies - through shopping as consumers and saving / investing as investors - has an effect on the life-supporting biosphere we rely on to keep our planet inhabitable. In essence, from an ecological perspective, every financial action is either an investment decision to support more environmentally-friendly companies - or to support polluters.\n",

I leverage *design research* to find design concepts for *simple AI-based user interfaces* also known as *generative UIs* to help young adults participate in *sustainable financial activism*. A survey of 700 students across 10 universities in Taiwan was conducted, enhanced by 5 expert interviews providing industry insights.

        "\n",
        "I grew up as an avid science fiction reader, which influenced my outlook towards future possibilities. In particular, the Star Trek universe had an imaginary portable device called a ***tricorder*** (fig. 1) enabling scientists to scan anything for insights. Be it precious minerals inside a cave or scanning the human bodies for medical data, its sensors would show up with some useful data. In daily life, I would love to have such a device for consumer choices and financial decisions - to know what to buy and which businesses to support with my money and approval.\n",

        "While a *tricorder* is still science fiction, technological advancements are getting closer and closer to producing something similar. AIs are already integral to many parts of our lives, with computer models producing increasingly useful outputs. The proposal for this thesis was first written using Google's and Apple's voice recognition software in 2020, and later switching to OpenAI's *Whisper* model, allowing me to transcribe notes with the help of an AI assistant. As a foreigner living in Taiwan since 2019, I relied on AI-based tools for many aspects of my life: speaking, moving, finding food and services. When writing in Chinese, Apple's text prediction algorithms translate pinyin to 漢字 and show the most likely character based on my previous writing, Google's maps find efficient and eco-friendly routes and recommend places to eat and ChatGPT provides statistically probable advice from the sum of human knowledge. Even when we don't realize it, AI is helping us with many mundane tasks. While it takes incredibly complex computational algorithms to achieve all this in the background, it's become so commonplace, we don't even think about it. From this point of view, another AI assistant to help students with choosing more eco-friendly businesses - to shop, save, and invest - doesn't sound so much of a stretch.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Motivation\n",
        "\n",
        "Environmental degradation is increasingly affecting human lives - and it's largely driven by manufacturing processes - of the products we consume daily. From resource extraction in the linear economy (mining raw materials and drilling for fossil fuels) to chemical processes (causing contamination and pollution of the air, water, and soil) to waste generation and greenhouse gas emissions, industries transform the natural world into consumer products. While industry practices have improved since the industrial revolution in the 19th century, and continue to improve, it's possible to further improve standards of production and raise the global baseline for sustainability, given enough societal pressure to do so.\n",
        "\n",
        "Nonetheless, without easily accessible and reliable data, it's difficult to know which company is more sustainable than another. As consumers and investors (even if only through passive ownership of savings), we don't really know much about enterprise production practices, unless we spend a lot of time looking at the numbers, which may be costly to access (for example ESG reports are expensive), and mostly rely on our governments and international bodies to keep us safe. Or just look at the brands themselves - and pick the ones which we like.\n",

Personas help to reflect on what kind of *biases* might exist in the design. Within the larger cohort of college students several different personas could be defined, for example grouping people by interests, knowledge, habits, levels of anxiety, and other attributes.\n",

        "\n",
        "*\"Nachhaltigkeit\"* - *sustainability* in German - was likely the first use of the concept of preserving natural resources, conceived by a tax accountant Hannß Carl von Carlowitz in 1713 in his seminal book on forestry - *Sylvicultura oeconomica -*, referring to the goal of achieving prudent forest management practices in his native Saxony in Southeastern Germany, which at the time was under severe *deforestation* pressure from mining, ship-building and agricultural production [@hannsscarlvoncarlowitzSylviculturaOeconomicaOder1713; @gottschlichLegacySylviculturaOeconomica2014]. This particular field of sustainability study is now known as *sustainable yield of natural capital*. The *principal* of the natural resource being managed, such as in fishing and forestry, shouldn't be over-harvested in order to maintain ***ecosystem services*** - a contemporary term from the theory of *natural capital*, referring to benefits humans receive from the stock of world's natural resources [@peterkareivaNaturalCapitalTheory2011].\n",
        "\n",
        "Defining sustainability perhaps more poetically, the American wildlife ecologist Aldo Leopold proposed the idea of *land ethics* in 1972 as *\"\\[a\\] thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise\"* in his landmark work *A Sand County Almanac* [@leopoldSandCountyAlmanac1972]. In a similar vein, the 1987 United Nations' Brundtland Report titled \"*Our Common Future\"* defined *sustainable development* as *\"Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\"* [@worldcommissiononenvironmentanddevelopmentOurCommonFuture1987]. Given these varied ideas for over 300 years, I believe some percentage of people have been concerned with our planet's natural environment and its preservation already for centuries. Yet, it is only in the last 100 and so years that human activities have begun to affect Earth's systems on a previously unseen scale - termed *Anthropocene* -, necessitating a deeper understanding of human-nature interactions, such as in the case of climate change, which is rapidly changing the face of our living environments.\n",

        "Studies of Earth's climate go back for over 200 years, starting with Alexander von Humboldt,the founder of climatology, who revolutionized cartography by inventing the first *isothermal maps* in 1816; these maps showed areas with similar temperature, variations in altitude and seasons in different colors [@hontonForgottenFatherClimatology2022] now available as 3D computer models[@IsothermsSimplyEarth2023]. Already in 1896, the Nobel Prize winner Svante Arrhenius first calculated how an increase in CO~2~ levels could have a warming effect on our global climate [@andersonCO2GreenhouseEffect2016; @wulffPetterLegacy2020]. In 1938, Guy Stewart Callendar was the first scientist to demonstrate the warming of Earth's land surface as well as linking the production of fossil fuels to increased CO~2~e and changing climate [@hawkinsIncreasingGlobalTemperatures2013]. Early scientists pioneered climate modeling by calculating the first climate interactions which precede today's complex computer-based *Earth System Models (ESMs)* that integrate the various Earth systems and cycles run on supercomputers [@andersonCO2GreenhouseEffect2016].\n",

Even though awareness of Earth's warming climate was growing ever stronger, the CO~2~ emissions kept rising too. The hockey-stick growth of CO~2~ concentration since the industrial revolution is clear in the data from 1958 onward, following a steady annual increase, called the *Keeling Curve* [@keelingAtmosphericMonthlySitu2017]. Written records of global temperature measurements are available starting from the 1880s, when temperatures began to be documented in ship logs [@BrohanClimate2012]. Finally, although perhaps less accurately, temperature estimations from tree-trunks allow some comparisons with the climate as far back as 2000 years ago [@rubinoLawDomeIce2019].\n",

        "In Europe, *eco-design* has strong political support as part of the European Union's (EU) *\"Green Deal\"* legislative strategy, aiming to transform European economies into sustainability leaders. A large part of the proposal by [@commissionEcodesignYourFuture2014] is *eco-design*, as a large part of product lifecycle environmental impact is defined in the design process. The Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR) entered into force in the EU on July 18, 2024 [@europeancommissionEcodesignSustainableProducts2024] following the [@europeanparliamentEcodesignSustainableProducts2022] proposal whereby the European Commission established a general framework for *eco-design: \"requirements for sustainable products, repealing rules \\[referring to the previous Eco-Design Directive (2009/125/EC)\\] currently in force which concentrate on energy-related products only,\"* setting up a level playing-field for the organizations operating on the EU single market. Virginijus Sinkevičius, the EU Commissioner for the Environment, Oceans and Fisheries, is quoted describing eco-design as design that *\"respects the boundaries of our planet\"* [@europeancommissionGreenDealNew2022].\n",

        "The EU is also concerned with supply-chain deforestation. Sustainable Products and EUDR (European Union Deforestation Regulation) work hand-in-hand as part of EU's legislative efforts to promote sustainability. EUDR applies to all products placed on the market from 30 December 2024 and 30 June 2025 for small businesses.\n",

In the US, the *Inflation Reduction Act* provides funding to development of decarbonizing technologies and includes plans to combat air pollution, reduce green house gases and address environmental injustices [@rajagopalanInflationReductionAct2023]. Many other jurisdictions also have laws that aim to reduce the environmental impact of products throughout their life cycles. For instance Australia has a Product Stewardship (PS) scheme, which also includes an investment fund targeted at increasing the recycling rates of specific products [@australiangovernmentProductStewardshipAustralia2024]. Australia, Japan, and Taiwan all have Sustainable Procurement schemes prioritizing greener products in public purchases \\[ADD CITATION\\]. While Taiwan doesn't yet have a specific eco-design law, there are various pieces of legislation promoting circular economy \\[ADD CITATION\\]. Already in 1988 Taiwan implemented an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme, followed by a recycling system (initially focused on electronic items) in 1998 [@chongProductStewardshipSchemes2009].

Blockchains enable saving immutable records into distributed databases (also known as ledgers). It's not possible to (or extremely difficult) to change the same record, only new records can be added on top of new ones. Blockchains are useful for data sharing and auditing, as the time and place of data input can be guaranteed, and it will be easier to conduct a search on who inputted incorrect data; however the system still relies on correct data input.

        "The fact that AI systems work so well is proof that we live in a measurable world. The world is filled with structures: nature, cultures, languages, human interactions - all form intricate patterns. Computer systems are increasingly capable in their ability copy these patterns into computer models - known as machine learning. As of 2023, 97 zettabytes (and growing) of data was created in the world per year [@soundaryajayaramanHowBigBig2023]. Big data is a basic requirement for training AIs, enabling learning from the structures of the world with increasing accuracy. Representations of the real world in digital models enable humans to ask questions about the real-world structures and to manipulate them to create synthetic experiments that may match the real world (if the model is accurate enough). This can be used for generating human-sounding language and realistic images, finding mechanisms for novel medicines as well as understanding the fundamental functioning of life on its deep physical and chemical level [@nopriorsInceptiveCEOJakob2023].\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, Human Patterns Enable AIs. Already ninety years ago [@mccullochLogicalCalculusIdeas1943] proposed the first mathematical model of a neural network inspired by the human brain. Alan Turing's Test for Machine Intelligence followed in 1950. Turing's initial idea was to design a game of imitation to test human-computer interaction using text messages between a human and 2 other participants, one of which was a human, and the other - a computer. The question was, if the human was simultaneously speaking to another human and a machine, could the messages from the machine be clearly distinguished or would they resemble a human being so much, that the person asking questions would be deceived, unable to realize which one is the human and which one is the machine? [@turingCOMPUTINGMACHINERYINTELLIGENCE1950].\n",
        "\n",
        "> Alan Turing: *\"I believe that in about fifty years' time it will be possible to program computers, with a storage capacity of about 10^9^, to make them play the imitation game so well that an average interrogator will not have more than 70 percent chance of making the right identification after five minutes of questioning. ... I believe that at the end of the century the use of words and general educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted.\"* - from [@stanfordencyclopediaofphilosophyTuringTest2021]\n",
        "\n",
        "By the 2010s AI models became capable enough to beat humans in games of Go and Chess, yet they did not yet pass the Turing test. AI use was limited to specific tasks. While over the years, the field of AI had seen a long process of incremental improvements, developing increasingly advanced models of decision-making, it took an ***increase in computing power*** and an approach called ***deep learning***, a variation of ***machine learning (1980s),*** largely modeled after the ***neural networks*** of the biological (human) brain, returning to the idea of ***biomimicry***, inspired by nature, building a machine to resemble the connections between neurons, but digitally, on layers much deeper than attempted before.\n",

Indeed, the comparison is apt, as the AI field now offers jobs for *AI psychologists (ADD CITATION)*, whose role is to figure out what exactly is happening inside the 'AI brain'. Understading the insides of AI models trained of massive amounts of data is important because they are *foundational*, enabling a holistic approach to learning, combining many disciplines using languages, instead of the reductionist way we as human think because of our limitations [@capinstituteGettingRealArtificial2023].\n",

The advent of generative AIs was a revolution in human-computer interaction as AI models became increasingly capable of producing human-like content which is hard to distinguish from actual human creations. This power comes with *increased need for responsibility*, drawing growing interest in fields like *AI ethics* and *AI explainability.* Generative has a potential for misuse, as humans are increasingly confused by what is computer-generated and what is human-created, unable to separate one from the other with certainty.\n",

Widespread Internet of Things (IoT) sensor networks that gather data analyzed by AI algorithms, integrates computing even deeper into the fabric of daily human existence. Several terms of different origin but considerable overlap describe this phenomenon, including *Pervasive Computing (PC)* [@rogersFourPhasesPervasive2022] and *Ubiquitous Computing*. Similar concepts are *Ambient Computing*, which focuses more on the invisibility of technology, fading into the background, without us, humans, even noticing it, and *Calm Technology*, which highlights how technology respects humans and our limited attention spans, and doesn't call attention to itself.

In practice, this means combination several AI models within the same interface. For example, on the input side, one model is used for human speech or image recognition which are transcribed into tokens that can be ingested into an LLM. On the output side, the LLM can generate instructions which are fed into an image / audio generation model or even computer code which can be ran on a virtual machine and then the output displayed inside the conversation.\n",

This approach however is a moving target as foundational models keep changing rapidly and the baseline might differ from today to 6 months later.\n",

However, software designers can significantly reduce mental strain by crafting easy-to-use software and user-friendly user journeys. Software interaction design goes beyond the form-factor and accounts for human needs by using responsive design on the screen, aural feedback cues in sound design, and even more crucially, by showing the relevant content at the right time, making a profound difference to the experience, keeping the user engaged and returning for more. In the words of [@babichInteractionDesignVs2019], ***\"***\\[T\\]he moment of interaction is just a part of the journey that a user goes through when they interact with a product.

For a sustainable investment service, getting to a state of success - or failure - may take years, and even longer.

Personal notifications and chat messages are not enough unless they provide the right motivation. Could visualizing a connection to a larger system, showing the impact of the eco-friendly actions taken by the user, provide a meaningful motivation to the user, and a strong signal to the businesses? |\n",

        "The first two decades of the 21st century have seen increasing economic thinking, looking to challenge, improve and upgrade capitalism to match our current environmental, social, and technological situation, often called *New Economics.* Some of these include behavioral economics, sustainable capitalism, regenerative capitalism, doughnut economics, ecological economics, blue economy, degrowth, attention economy, gift economy, intent economy, among others. There's no lack of published books on changing capitalism, which goes to show there's readership for these ideas. Build a new economic theory is out of scope for my thesis design, however I'll focus on the parts of economic theory I believe are relevant for *interaction design*-ing for sustainability."

        "The qualitative research methods employed in the first stage of the research design enables me to explore concepts arising for literature review further, using a more open approach, without limiting the conversation only to pre-ascribed notions. The strength of the qualitative approach in the first stage is to encourage the discovery of new ideas, not yet common in literature and potential user experience factors related to sustainable investing and user experience.\n",

        "### Phase Two - Quantitative Research\n",
        "\n",
        "The strength of quantitative research is to enable me to access a larger sample of potential users in two countries, using online survey methods, and to validate some of the qualitative findings from stage one.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Sampling** My quantitative sampling structure uses a judgmental criterion: age 18-35, located in Sweden or Taiwan, surveyed using an English-language online survey.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Method:** Likert The survey includes a Likert scale between 1 to 7 to validate key findings from the first stage of the research by assessing responses to statements regarding the app's design, features, and other criteria that may still emerge.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Method:** Choice Experiment The survey includes a choice experiment between different sets of potential features available when communicating with the sustainable finance AI companion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Phase Three - Qualitative Research\n",
        "\n",
        "In the last phase, I will return to the qualitative methods to further validate the quantitative findings from stage two.

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "**Method:** Thematic Analysis Finally, I will perform a thematic analysis of the focus group transcriptions in order to validate previous findings, and open avenues for future research.\n",
