**Kris Haamer:** Yeah, so let me repeat the question so I can get your answer into this recording.

**Chen‑Ying Huang:** Okay.

**Kris Haamer:** So we're discussing the flow of the user and how it affects the decisions,…

**Chen‑Ying Huang:** right So basically I'm thinking that people are lazy.

**Kris Haamer:** right?

**Chen‑Ying Huang:** I look at myself. I'm really lazy when shopping and so you should if it's easier to get the information that I don't have to click on the button to receive the information. It's more likely that I will even pay attention to that and…

**Kris Haamer:** Right, right.

**Chen‑Ying Huang:** also that words are very difficult to read through so I don't really have incentive to read a lot but if it's just a picture showing that the product somehow is green — like saving whatever picture you can put on the iceberg or the polar bear or whatever — that will immediately let me realize that this product is green and maybe there could be a scale like how green it is from zero to a hundred and then I can immediately know how green this product is.

**Kris Haamer:** even…

**Chen‑Ying Huang:** Maybe there would be an effect on me. So I'm thinking more along this line.

**Kris Haamer:** right, right, visually understandable or really quickly understandable images instead of this kind of report.

**Chen‑Ying Huang:** right. Yeah.

**Kris Haamer:** Yeah. I haven't tested that. How this research started was from my own interest — I’m kind of a nerd. I’ve always loved *Star Trek*; they have medical professionals with a scanner that can scan your whole body just by waving it and then understand what's wrong with you. So every time I bought some product I felt like I want this kind of scanner just to give me quick information about whether this is a good product, and I thought I'd try to build something like that.

**Chen‑Ying Huang:** Okay.

**Kris Haamer:** But then I realized if I actually want to make a working prototype it's really difficult on a mobile phone, even though that would be the obvious choice, because the Apple ecosystem is closed, so you can't really do a lot. On the other hand, the Google Chrome browser is very open, so I can take any website like Momo and basically rewrite the page using an extension.

**Chen‑Ying Huang:** Okay.

**Kris Haamer:** That's how I ended up focusing on online shopping, Momo in particular. And then getting it to technically work‑—AI is slow, that’s the main challenge. If I pre‑bake these pages and test them, I could do pre‑made images or pre‑made reports. But here it's actually working in real time: you can go to any page on Momo and it will do this analysis using actual data. That’s why there’s just a button instead of a pre‑rendered overlay. And then a bit further down I came up with this kind of scoring…

**Kris Haamer:** Because my intuition was that maybe the social aspects of a product — what other people who bought it think — could also be relevant. But so far, among the 20 people who actually saw this, they didn’t honestly understand what these numbers were or why they were there; none of them understood it. Then if you go further down there’s another button that takes you to a new page and you get to the actual app part, which is much bigger and that I have more control over than a Momo page. Even though Chrome is quite open there are still lots of limitations on, for example, how to track the user. So if you come to *my* page I can track where you scroll, where your cursor goes, and I can use that data.

00:05:00

**Chen‑Ying Huang:** Wait, so you’re not randomly sampling people from Momo, right? You’re asking subjects to participate in your experiment. So in that sense…

**Kris Haamer:** Yes, yes.

**Chen‑Ying Huang:** Wouldn’t it be possible… You want a natural environment where they’re shopping? Otherwise, why wouldn’t it be possible for them to read some information about the product here — the information you provide — before they really look at the specification of the product itself?

**Kris Haamer:** Mmm. Yes. Because I'm from the design department, our approach to experiments isn't very scientific. Design thinking is kind of quasi‑research: you do workshops, get some people, try to use this Double Diamond format to get insights, but it’s not scientific at all. It mostly gives you keywords or intuitions. I tried to do better and ran a survey — my Chinese isn’t good enough for in‑depth interviews — so I focused on a survey. It’s 63 questions so I get a lot of data. Then I use k‑means (or actually k‑prototypes) to cluster it and create personas based on similarity. Maybe I’ll just share that page…

**Chen‑Ying Huang:** Mm‑hmm, yeah.

**Kris Haamer:** It’s easier to talk about if you can see it.

**Chen‑Ying Huang:** So from the survey data…

**Kris Haamer:** Right. So these are the three personas that came out of the data…

**Chen‑Ying Huang:** Okay, okay.

**Kris Haamer:** There are different ways to do it, but basically one persona really cares about the environment, one is frugal, one is more parent‑like, etc. There’s overlap: e.g. product origin is relevant for most respondents, materials are more important for the “parently” persona, price for the frugal persona. The social score didn’t resonate — people didn’t understand or didn’t care. So after all that I still need to test what I built. My professor suggested one‑on‑one user tests with the live extension and see how far people get…

00:10:00

**Kris Haamer:** If I go back to the original idea of the research: maybe the product page is an entry point, and I could create a funnel and get people to *invest* in that company in some way. Investing in a broad sense: either buying the product, or becoming a shareholder…

**Chen‑Ying Huang:** No…

**Kris Haamer:** But I’m realizing this is way too big for a master’s degree — shopping, saving, investing are huge fields. Maybe I was naïve — no finance background, thinking purely in terms of UI. I thought I could build this funnel…

**Chen‑Ying Huang:** It’s still good to have a dream.

**Kris Haamer:** But now I see that I can’t even get people from the Momo page into my app — most drop at the first step. So maybe the big takeaway *is* that it’s really hard to get people from point zero to that far‑away place.

**Kris Haamer:** Coming back to the app: there’s shopping, saving, investing. I tried to build a friendly ChatGPT‑like assistant here…

**Chen‑Ying Huang:** A fun question is really interesting: “Where can I buy those products in Tainan?” I think that’s useful.

**Kris Haamer:** Those questions are based on the survey. But most testers didn’t know what to ask.

**Kris Haamer:** I tried to localize: the more precise and relevant you are, the higher the conversion. And this page (not ready yet) will generate e.g. a factory map so you can see where the product comes from, maybe even pictures from the factory. Particularly for food: milk, meat—you could see distance and animal conditions. Maybe livestreams. But that data is hard to get, so for now it’s a mock‑up.

00:15:00

**Kris Haamer:** Because this is a journey, I added sections where you can set a financial goal. In testing, students gave very standard answers (get a master’s, get a job), so it wasn’t so useful. I thought the AI could use a specific goal to give advice. Then I had a stock portfolio section with real data. I wanted ESG data live, but that costs USD 4 000/month — impossible for consumers. Only some companies publish free ESG data, so I can only do a mock‑up with last‑year numbers. Rabbit holes everywhere…

**Kris Haamer:** I mentioned degrowth, doughnut economics, etc., and wanted an economist’s view. That’s why I wanted this call.

**Chen‑Ying Huang:** From your email I thought I could maybe help a little with your first goal — influencing shopping behaviour. The other goals are too big. My intuition is: make the information relevant and simple. Then you have a better chance. Sometimes introducing an obviously worse decoy option works: if you show a product that’s clearly worse environmentally, people choose the target one…

**Kris Haamer:** That would be a product comparison, maybe a sidebar with alternatives and different scores.

**Chen‑Ying Huang:** If the company spends part of its profit on green initiatives, that’s costless to the consumer but may sway them, assuming price is competitive. But detailed information like your report targets experts, not rushing consumers.

**Kris Haamer:** Right. I need to make it obvious, simpler.

**Chen‑Ying Huang:** Key still: spec, price, reputation/durability. Green pages must have figured out something — have you looked at sites selling only green products?

00:20:00

**Kris Haamer:** Yes, there are green shopping malls, but you already have to be a green consumer to visit them. That’s why I focus on mainstream sites like Momo/Shopee. Layout on Shopee is harder to inject an AI box. Even Momo’s sidebar catches people’s eyes; maybe I should target that. On Shopee the layout is too cramped.

**Chen‑Ying Huang:** On those green pages, do they show which product is greener? If all products are “green,” there’s no comparison.

**Kris Haamer:** They don’t really do comparisons; they just curate. There are rating sites (like Fashion Transparency Index) but if I focused only on fashion I could be more precise. Testing then becomes: “Look for a brand of clothes you like.” For now I let users pick any product — but many pick luxury items they can’t afford, so how useful is that?

**Chen‑Ying Huang:** It’s not a purchasing experiment then.

**Kris Haamer:** Exactly. They look at aspirational items. Then why read a sustainability report if you won’t buy it?

**Kris Haamer:** The way I test now isn’t working. I want to redesign before semester ends in June. My idea: since the survey worked online, ask people to download the extension themselves. They fill out the survey first (so I know the persona) and then use the extension.

**Chen‑Ying Huang:** So subjects do the survey, then the extension. One green version, one control version. Randomly assign. Compare behaviour. If there’s a difference, it’s the app. Step by step.

**Kris Haamer:** Right. I realise that means losing my big funnel vision, but maybe it’s fine.

00:25:00

**Chen‑Ying Huang:** Show me the first click? Can we go back to Momo… Where’s your button placed?

**Kris Haamer:** Right now it loads here… People miss it, so I plan to move it next to the price. Most people look at the price. About half click without prompting; with prompting, nearly all do.

**Chen‑Ying Huang:** That’s okay. Next to the price is good.

**Kris Haamer:** Internet is slow here in Macau…

**Chen‑Ying Huang:** It’s impressive you put this into action. If you can increase the click‑through rate, that’s key. Maybe shorten the info so people actually read it.

**Kris Haamer:** The report changes every time; it’s dynamic. Eye‑trackers could show what people read, but that’s overkill. Maybe mouse tracking is enough. I can only track on my own page, not on Momo due to Chrome restrictions.

00:30:00

**Chen‑Ying Huang:** Maybe simplify each step so if a user really wants to proceed, they *have* to click, and you just track clicks. Two extensions: green vs. control.

**Kris Haamer:** Yes. I’m already over my head; adding eye‑tracking is too much.

**Chen‑Ying Huang:** A quick mouse tracker is fine. And talk to a marketing expert: I have a colleague at NTU (international business) who does field experiments like this. She could help with funnel optimisation. And another colleague who does climate-change econometrics.

**Kris Haamer:** That would be amazing.

00:35:00

**Chen‑Ying Huang:** I’ll email introduce you. Meanwhile, focus on click‑through rate. That’s where your data comes from.

**Kris Haamer:** Yes, my teachers need a grounded story — economics theory, why focus on this angle.

**Chen‑Ying Huang:** Motivation, yes, but I’d worry more about the funnel metrics.

**Kris Haamer:** Changing one sentence in Chinese on the Momo page could be key — some testers said it sounds awkward now. I tried to stay neutral and not preach sustainability, so non‑green users might still click and learn.

**Chen‑Ying Huang:** GPT can help rewrite. People care about money; phrase it that way.

00:40:00

**Kris Haamer:** I’ve had 50 versions of that tooltip already…

**Chen‑Ying Huang:** Marketing colleague can help. Shorten content so there’s a chance users read it. Probably more influence.

**Kris Haamer:** The report ID lets me track which version they saw. But on Momo I can’t track anything else.

**Chen‑Ying Huang:** Simplify the page; I wouldn’t read that many words.

**Kris Haamer:** Right.

00:45:00

**Kris Haamer:** This has been super helpful. Thank you.

**Chen‑Ying Huang:** I’ll email the two colleagues and copy you. The econometrician does climate change, the marketing professor does funnel experiments.

**Kris Haamer:** Perfect. I’m wrapping this into a presentation for my thesis defence — too many things, but I need to ground it.

**Chen‑Ying Huang:** I’d be happy if my student came up with an app like this.

**Kris Haamer:** Thanks so much.

**Chen‑Ying Huang:** I’ll email later. Bye!

**Kris Haamer:** Thank you. Bye‑bye.
