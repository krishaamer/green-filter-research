# Abstract

## *The Journey from Consumer to Investor: Designing a Financial AI Companion for Young Adults to Help with Sustainable Shopping, Saving, and Investing*

Financial decisions, such as shopping, saving, and investing, significantly impact an individual's ecological footprint. However, it can be challenging for even highly motivated individuals to effectively identify and prioritize sustainable options in their daily lives. By working together, groups of individuals can leverage their collective influence to make more sustainable choices and reduce their ecological footprint. This study presents a speculative design for an AI companion that aims to facilitate the development of long-term relationships with sustainability-focused companies and introduce the concept of "shopping-as-investing". The major contribution of the study is an interactive artefact (a prototype) informed by design research.
