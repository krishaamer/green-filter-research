# Abstract

## *The Journey from Consumer to Investor: Designing a Financial AI Companion for Young Adults to Empower Sustainable Shopping, Saving, and Investing*

Overconsumption-driven extractive business practices are a large contributor to the degradation of Earth's natural ecosystems, global warming, pollution of water, air, soil, diminishing biodiversity, and many other environmental problems.

For the individual, it's difficult to know what's sustainable. Even for highly motivated people, taking sustainable financial actions requires extensive research. Sustainability-focused companies exist but it's time-consuming to find and transact with them.

I present an AI-assistant to empower regenerative financial activism. All interactions with businesses from shopping to saving and investing can be seen through the filter of sustainability. I propose *interfaces* and *workflows* to help people develop long-term relationships with sustainability-focused companies and build communities of sustainable impact. The major contribution of the study is an interactive artefact - a design prototype of an AI companion, informed by design research.
