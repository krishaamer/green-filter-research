# Abstract

## *The Journey from Consumer to Investor: Designing a Financial AI Companion for Young Adults to Help with Sustainable Shopping, Saving, and Investing*

**Version 1**:
Financial decisions including shopping, saving, and investing, significantly impact a person's ecological footprint. Nevertheless, even for highly motivated individuals, it can be challenging to identify and prioritize sustainable options. Sustainability presents a complex interaction design problem hindered by ambiguous data (what is sustainable?) and messy human motivations (we love buying things). This research is concerned with making sustainability more intuitive and introduces the concept of "shopping-as-investing". Moreover, the research proposes interfaces and workflows to help groups of people work together to leverage their collective influence and develop long-term relationships with sustainability-focused companies. The major contribution of the study is an interactive artefact, an AI companion UI/UX design prototype, informed by design research.

**Version 2 (ChatGTP Assisted)**:
Sustainability is a complex issue that poses a significant challenge in the daily lives of individuals. Financial decisions, such as shopping, saving, and investing, have a significant impact on an individual's ecological footprint, but even for highly motivated individuals, identifying and prioritizing sustainable products can be difficult. The problem is further compounded by ambiguous data on what is considered sustainable and messy human motivations. To address this problem, this research aims to make sustainability more intuitive by introducing the concept of "shopping-as-investing." This concept emphasizes that purchasing decisions can be viewed as investments in sustainable products and companies. To support this concept, the research proposes interfaces and workflows that help groups of people work together to leverage their collective influence and develop long-term relationships with sustainability-focused companies. The major contribution of the study is an interactive artefact, an AI companion UI/UX design prototype, which is informed by design research and aims to make daily sustainability more intuitive and actionable for individuals.

**Version 3 (Simplify)**:
Sustainability presents a complex interaction design problem hindered by ambiguous data (what is sustainable?) and messy human motivations (we love buying things). Financial decisions, such as shopping, saving, and investing, have a significant impact on an individual's ecological footprint, but even for highly motivated individuals, identifying and prioritizing sustainable products can be difficult. This research is concerned with making sustainability more intuitive and introduces the concept of "shopping-as-investing" and .

**Version 4 (AI Focus)**:
This research aims to address the challenge of sustainability by introducing the use of AI companions to assist individuals in making sustainable choices. The study proposes the use of AI companions through interfaces and workflows, providing personalized recommendations and nudges to make sustainable options more accessible. The concept of "shopping-as-investing" is also introduced, emphasizing that consumption decisions can be considered as investments in sustainable products and companies. The major contribution of the study is the development of an AI companion UI/UX design prototype, informed by design research, aimed to make daily sustainability more intuitive and actionable for individuals.
