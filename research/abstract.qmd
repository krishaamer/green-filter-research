# Abstract

## *The Journey from Consumer to Investor: Designing a Financial AI Companion for Young Adults to Help with Sustainable Shopping, Saving, and Investing*

Financial decisions including shopping, saving and investing have an effect on personal sustainably however quickly filtering 'green' from the polluting in daily life is not a trivial task. This study presents a speculative design of an AI companion which seeks to make it easier to build long-term relationships with sustainability-focused companies. Furthermore, the study introduces the concept of 'shopping-as-investing'. The major contribution of the study is an interactive artefact (a prototype) informed by design research.
