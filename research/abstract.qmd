# Abstract

## *Designing a Green Filter to Help College Students Shop, Save, and Invest*

For the individual college student, it's difficult to know what's sustainable. Even for a highly motivated person, taking sustainable financial action requires time-consuming research in the midst of widespread greenwashing. People lack tools to buy, save, and invest with a focus on sustainability.

This cross-disciplinary research focuses on the intersection of sustainability, transparency, financial activism, AI assistants, data-driven interaction design, and college students.

I present an AI-assistant called "green filter" and propose *interfaces* and *workflows* to help college students see their financial interactions through the lens of sustainability. The major contribution of this thesis is an interactive artefact: a design prototype informed by design research.
