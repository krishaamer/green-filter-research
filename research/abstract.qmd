# Abstract

## *The Journey from Consumer to Investor: Designing a Financial AI Companion for Young Adults to Help with Sustainable Shopping, Saving, and Investing*

While a rising number of people express eco-conscious ideas, it's non-trivial to practice sustainability in daily life. Financial decisions including shopping, saving and investing have a considerable effect on sustainably yet it's difficult to filter 'green' from the polluting. The study presents a speculative design of an AI companion which seeks to help build long-term relationships with sustainability-focused companies. Furthermore, the study introduces the concepts of 'shopping-as-investing' and 'investment-as-product'. The major contribution of the study is an interactive artefact (a prototype) informed by design research.
