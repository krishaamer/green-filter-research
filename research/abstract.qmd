# Abstract

## The Journey from Consumer to Investor: Designing a Financial AI Companion for Young Adults to Help With Sustainable Shopping, Saving, and Investing

Planet Earth's natural environment is being heavily degraded by wasteful resource use to make the products and services we buy every day. The way we use our money - through shopping as consumers and saving and investing as investors - deeply affects our ecosystems, water and air - the life support systems making our planet inhabitable.

College students in particular are concerned with climate change, yet, at the same time, we are also busy and lack simple tools to make sustainable decisions. It’s time-consuming to find sustainability-focused companies, who are truly trying to be zero-waste, in the midst of widespread greenwashing. Taking sustainable financial action requires extensive time for research. Even for highly motivated people, it’s difficult to know what’s sustainable.

This research is focused on finding design concepts for simple user interfaces to enable college students participate in sustainable financial activism. Using our money to support more environmentally-friendly companies is a step towards investing in sustainability.

Data-driven interaction design enables us to build transparency into opaque systems using Digital Product Passports.

Providing a gateway, an entry point, a landing page for a journey towards investing in sustainability.

Environmentally-conscious values with convenience. I propose *interfaces* and *workflows* to see financial interactions through the filter of sustainability.

The major contribution of the study is an interactive artefact: a design prototype AI-assistant informed by design research.
