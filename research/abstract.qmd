# Abstract

## The Journey from Consumer to Investor: Designing a Financial AI Companion for Young Adults to Help With Sustainable Shopping, Saving, and Investing

College students are concerned with the environment, yet they are busy with school and hindered by unavailability of simple tools to affect systemic change. Stronger environmental policy from the European Union includes the concept of ***digital product passports***, which holds the promise to help distinguish ***eco-designed*** products made by ***circular economy*** companies trying to be zero-waste from companies that simply say they are. Tracking product data from the source materials until the consumer, combined with ***data-driven interaction design*** facilitates building transparency into opaque systems. Likewise, advances in the development of ***large-language models*** enables ***artificial intelligence assistants*** to become a translation layer between complex environmental data and human-comprehensible language.

The emerging field of ***Planetary Health*** recognizes profound interconnections between our economic behaviors, ecosystem services such as clean water, air, soil, the climate crisis, and human health. As of 2024, Earth's natural environment is being heavily degraded by the extractive business practices of companies that make many of the products and services we buy every day. The way we use our money to interact with companies - through shopping as consumers and saving / investing as investors - has an effect on the life-supporting biosphere we rely on to keep our planet inhabitable. In essence, from an ecological perspective, every financial action is either an investment decision to support more environmentally-friendly companies - or to support polluters.

My research addresses the need for tools to make sustainable financial action convenient for college students. I focus on leveraging ***design research*** to find design concepts for ***simple AI user interfaces*** also known as ***generative UI*** to help college students participate in ***sustainable financial activism***. A survey of 700 students across 10 universities in Taiwan was conducted, enhanced by 5 expert interviews providing industry insights. The major contribution of the study is an interactive AI-assistant prototype.

Keywords: Climate Anxiety, Human-AI Interaction, Digital Sustainability, Financial Activism, Transparency, Planetary Health

## 從消費者到投資者的旅程：為年輕成人設計一個財務AI夥伴，幫助他們進行可持續購物、儲蓄和投資

大學生關注環境問題，但因學業繁忙及缺乏簡便工具來影響體制改變而受阻。歐盟更強化環保政策，引入了「數位產品護照」的概念，此舉有望幫助區分由循環經濟公司製造的、努力實現零廢棄的「生態設計」產品，與僅聲稱自己環保的公司。從原材料到消費者的產品數據追踪，結合「數據驅動的互動設計」，有助於為不透明系統建立透明度。同樣地，「大型語言模型」的發展使得「人工智能助理」能夠成為複雜環境數據與人類可理解語言之間的翻譯層。

新興的「地球健康」領域認識到我們的經濟行為、生態系統服務（如淨水、空氣、土壤）、氣候危機與人類健康之間存在深刻的相互聯繫。截至2024年，地球的自然環境正被開採性企業的商業行為嚴重破壞，這些企業生產我們每天購買的許多產品和服務。我們通過消費和儲蓄/投資與公司的互動方式，對我們賴以生存的、支持地球可居住生物圈產生影響。從生態學的角度看，每一個財務行動都是支持更環保公司的投資決策，或是支持污染者。

我的研究應對了為大學生提供便於實行可持續財務行動的工具需求。我專注於利用「設計研究」來尋找「簡易AI用戶介面」的設計概念，也稱為「生成UI」，以幫助大學生參與「可持續財務行動主義」。在台灣10所大學進行了一項涵蓋700名學生的調查，並增加了5位專家訪談以提供行業見解。研究的主要貢獻是一個互動AI助理原型。

關鍵詞：氣候焦慮、人工智能互動、數位可持續性、財務行動主義、透明度、地球健康。
