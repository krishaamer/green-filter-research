The study reviews how sustainability relates to AI interaction design and presents an AI companion which seeks to help people avoid greenwashing and build long-term relationships with sustainability-focused companies to shop, save & invest sustainably. The major contribution of the study is an interactive artefact (a prototype) informed by design research.
