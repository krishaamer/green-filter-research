# Abstract

## *Designing a Green Filter to Help College Students Shop, Save, and Invest*

For the individual person, it's difficult to know what's sustainable. Even for highly motivated people, taking sustainable financial action requires extensive time-consuming research in the midst of widespread greenwashing. People lack trustworthy tools to buy, save, and invest.

I present an AI-assistant called "green filter" to empower regenerative financial activism. All financial interactions with businesses can be seen through the filter of sustainability. I propose *interfaces* and *workflows* to help people develop long-term relationships with regenerative companies that acknowledge ecological limits and make high-quality products.

The major contribution of the study is an interactive artefact: a design prototype informed by design research.
