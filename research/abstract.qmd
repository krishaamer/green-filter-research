# Abstract

## *The Journey from Consumer to Investor: Designing a Financial AI Companion for Young Adults to Encourage Sustainable Shopping, Saving, and Investing*

Environmental degradation of Earth (pollution of water, air, soil deterioration, etc) asperbated by climate change affects the health of people living around our planet, threathening to decrease everyone's quality of life. Meanwhile, each person's individual financial actions impact on Earth's ecology and natural resource use that in summa cause the climate crisis. By delegating our needs to companies that make products, we are entrusting businesesses to make sensible use of planetary resources. Nonetheless, lacking clear guidelines, it currently requires time-consuming research to identify sustainability-focused companies to invest in and to buy products from (a challenge even for highly motivated individuals). I propose enlisting AI companions to provide personal sustainability advice for each human in order to make finding sustainable companies more intuitive. Furthermore, I introduce the concept of "guided sustainability" to emphasize how purchasing decisions can be viewed as investments. To support this concept, I propose *interfaces* and *workflows* to help groups of people develop long-term relationships with sustainability-focused companies. The major contribution of the study is an interactive artefact - a design prototype of an AI companion, informed by design research.
