## The Journey from Consumer to Investor: Designing a Financial AI Companion for Young Adults to Help With Sustainable Shopping, Saving, and Investing

College students are concerned with the environment, yet they are busy with school and hindered by unavailability of simple tools to affect systemic change. Stronger environmental policy from the European Union includes the concept of ***digital product passports***, which holds the promise to help distinguish ***eco-designed*** products made by ***circular economy*** companies trying to be zero-waste from companies that simply say they are. Tracking product data from the source materials until the consumer, combined with ***data-driven interaction design*** facilitates building transparency into opaque systems. Likewise, advances in the development of ***large-language models*** enables ***artificial intelligence assistants*** to become a translation layer between complex environmental data and human-comprehensible language.

My research addresses the need for tools to make sustainable financial action convenient for college students. I focus on leveraging ***design research*** to find design concepts for ***simple AI user interfaces*** to help college students participate in ***sustainable financial activism***. A survey of 700 students across 10 universities in Taiwan was conducted, enhanced by 5 expert interviews providing industry insights. The major contribution of the study is an interactive AI-assistant prototype.
