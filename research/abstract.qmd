# Abstract

## *Designing a Sustainability-Focused AI Assistant to Help College Students Shop, Save, and Invest*

For the individual college student, it's difficult to know what's sustainable. Even for highly motivated people, taking sustainable financial actions requires extensive time for research. Sustainability-focused companies exist but it's time-consuming to find them in the midst of widespread greenwashing. People lack trustworthy tools to buy, save, and invest.

This cross-disciplinary research focuses on the intersection of sustainability, transparency, financial activism, AI assistants, and data-driven interaction design.

All financial interactions with businesses can be seen through the filter of sustainability. I present an AI-assistant called "green filter" and propose *interfaces* and *workflows* to help people develop relationships with regenerative companies that acknowledge ecological limits and make high-quality products. If used wisely, money can help build communities of sustainable impact.

The major contribution of the study is an interactive artefact: a design prototype informed by design research.
