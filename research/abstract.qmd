# Abstract

## *A Journey from Consumer to Investor: Designing an AI Companion for Financial Activism*

Degradation of Earth's natural environment affects the health of people living around our planet. Pollution of water, air, soil, diminishing biodiversity, rising global temperatures, etcetera, are caused by industrial companies which make use of natural resources to fulfill human needs. The sum of 8 Billion people's financial actions can encourage businesses adopt more eco-friendly business standards. 

Financial activism 

While sustainability-focused companies exist in every industry, it's time-consuming to find them among a sea of greenwashing. I propose enlisting AI companions and introduce the concept of "guided sustainability" to make financial  intuitive. 

To support this concept, I propose *interfaces* and *workflows* to help people develop long-term relationships with sustainability-focused companies and build communities of sustainable impact. The major contribution of the study is an interactive artefact - a design prototype of an AI companion, informed by design research.
