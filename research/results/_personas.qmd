# Personas

## Clustering Students to Build 3 Personas

Personas are created using K-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, which clusters college students based on their responses across 36 Likert-scale fields in the online survey. Clusters are visualized using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), where the principal component loadings on the X and Y axes represent the weights of the original Likert-scale fields, transformed into the principal components that capture the most variance.

- There is some similarity between clusters. All 3 personas report a high level of financial anxiety and below-average satisfaction with their financial literacy.

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to convert data to lower dimension space. This is a predecessor of embeddings.


```{python}
show_personas()
```


### Persona 1: "Eco-Friendly"
Questions Most Affecting Persona Creation include...

```{python}
show_single_persona(0)
```


### Persona 2: "Moderate"
Questions Most Affecting Persona Creation include...
```{python}
show_single_persona(1)
```


### Persona 3: "Frugal"
Questions Most Affecting Persona Creation include...
```{python}
show_single_persona(2)
```

## Clustering Heatmap

```{python}
show_clustering_heatmap()
```


## Mean Answer Scores
Mean response values for each Likert question in each cluster:

```{python}
get_kmeans_table()
```

## Agreement between personas
Highest agreement between personas is about health, safety, pollution and climate concerns.

```{python}
treemap()
```
