May 3

may3 
- first looked for NET clothes but Momo doesn't sell it 
- Looked for Sony camera lens

semi-structured interviews were conducted in chinese

the interviewer (me) took notes of the interviews

some gaps in the data exist due to the limited chinese language skills of the interviewer (me)


*Professor Feedback*
1 may prof suggestion - make connection between biodibersity and production and consumption clearer - what is the incentive for companies to share their data?

my own idea: like the switch of going from traditional banking with ATM machines on the street (or even the physica bank office) to online banking with mobile payments

hypothesis: esg accessibility can push companies to increase production standards

what if you can see ESG in near-realtime such as the stock market price

i can imagine esg derivative product like siemens gamesa

ai can help integrate esg derivatives into daily life to drive esg adoption

"effective altruism (EA)"

"Blockchain technology can improve price transparency in product distribution by allowing consumers to know the exact pricing from raw materials to distributors to suppliers."

## Interview Template
basic interview script - momo: what is a brand that you like'd or would like to buy - search - please pick a product (or search again) - on product page: what do you notice on this page? - what kind of information is important for you on this page? - do you notice anything else - (if the user doesn't notice the green filter, direct their attention to it and ask: what do you think this does?) - would you click on it - if the user says yes, continue - if thhe user says no, make note and continue - as the extension generates a response: what do you think about this content? - is there any information that you consider important? - anything else you see that you think looks special - do you see anywhere you can click? - would you click on it? - if yes, continue - if no, make note, and continue - explain: due to the limitation of the prototype, the test will continue on a separate page where you can ask questions - is there anything you would like to ask the helper? - notice if the user picks from sample questions - remind the user they can come up with their own question - as the ai is generating content ask: do you see any information in this content - did you know this before or is there any info you didn't know before? make note. - front page: explain the helper takes into account your personal info and goals. - ask: what kind of information do you think important to share with the helper?
