## Student Testing Interview Template

This is the basic interview script, which was used with small modifications at each interview.

On Momo:

-   What is a brand that you like'd or would like to buy - search - please pick a product (or search again)
-   After reaching Momo product page: what do you notice on this page?
-   What kind of information is important for you on this page?
-   Do you notice anything else?
-   (If the user doesn't notice the green filter, direct their attention to it and ask: what do you think this does?)
-   Would you click on it - if the user says yes, continue - if the user says no, make note and continue
-   As the extension generates a response: what do you think about this content?
-   Is there any information that you consider important?
-   Anything else you see that you think looks special
-   Do you see anywhere you can click?
-   Would you click on it? - if yes, continue - if no, make note, and continue.
-   Explain: due to the limitation of the prototype, the test will continue on a separate page where you can ask questions.
-   Is there anything you would like to ask the helper?
-   Notice if the user picks from sample questions
-   Remind the user they can come up with their own question
-   As the AI is generating content ask: do you see any information in this content
-   Did you know this before or is there any info you didn't know before? Make a note.
-   Front page: explain the helper takes into account your personal info and goals.
-   Ask: what kind of information do you think important to share with the helper?

## 2nd Wave of Testing (Fall 2024 - Spring 2025) - Prototype

Interviews and testing survey were conducted anonymously in hopes to have more honest responses from the responders.

-   32 anonymous Gen-Z participants in face-to-face interviews at 7 universities
-   Over 100 anonymous self-testing participants at over 20 universities
-   Testing is anonymous

Below you can see some of the images testers uploaded from their own devices (there were too many to be displayed here fully).

### Testing Summary

In-person interviews highlighted that participants generally appreciated the transparency provided by the Green Filter app regarding sustainability of products. Interviewees mentioned that the visibility of *"Material Sustainability"* and the historical and environmental impact of products influenced their perception and purchasing intentions, sometimes causing them to reconsider previously unquestioned consumption habits. Participants were particularly intrigued by the comprehensive information on carbon emissions, labor issues, and potential health risks from certain ingredients, emphasizing that such details were rarely accessible in typical shopping experiences. Additionally, participants valued AI-generated comparative data that offered alternative sustainable brands and products, which helped them better understand environmental impacts and make more informed choices.

However, usability issues surfaced regarding terminology and interface clarity. Some users misunderstood the labeling related to financial savings and carbon emission reductions, indicating the importance of precise and intuitive wording in Chinese.

| Rank | Feature | User Reaction |
|----:|-----------------|------------------------------------------|
| **1** | **Price / discounts / payment options** | “Usually I just look at the price.” “It’s acceptable if it isn’t too expensive.” |
| **2** | **Photos (product & user images)** | “Pictures attract me to click in.” “I rarely read long text, but I zoom every photo.” |
| **3** | **Reviews & star ratings** | “Reviews are vital, I need to see real buyer photos.” “I’ll open another page to compare reviews on different sites.” |
| 4 | **Key specs – size, color, warranty, return policy** | Often mentioned right after price and photos. |
| 5 | **Brand familiarity / past experience** | Several interviewees picked a product simply because “I’ve used this brand before.” |

| Feature | User Reaction |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| ESG / “environmental score” bar | Recognised in abstract but **low literate**: “ESG… I actually don’t know.” |
| Short textual flags (e.g., “30 % lower carbon”) | *Noticeable*; participants could paraphrase back (“because greenhouse effect”), but still uncertain what to do next. |
| Brand-level controversies (labour, packaging) | Triggers *surprise* (“I didn’t know Maybelline has environmental issues.”) and sometimes re-evaluation. |
| Concrete comparisons (alternate brands with better score) | **Most actionable**: many said they’d “consider” or “maybe switch” if the suggested alt met basic price/quality needs. |

| User Pain Point | Design Implications |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Slow network / long load times in several sessions | Lightweight placeholder images; lazy-load higher resolution later |
| Hidden or jargon-heavy sustainability text | Collapsible “Learn more” sections + tooltip definitions |
| Unclear second / third navigation tabs | Add microcopy (“Environmental impact”, “Invest in this brand”) |
| Desire to compare alternatives easily | Inline comparison table or swipe carousel with price + core spec |

| \# | Opportunity | Design Implications |
|-----|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **A** | Surface eco info *inside* the price/variant area (not in a far-right panel). | Add a tiny colored icon next to the price; hover or tap expands a one-sentence impact statement. |
| **B** | Swap *numeric ESG* with *plain language + graphic* | Try a horizontal traffic-light bar: Red / Yellow / Green with 1-line “Why”. |
| **C** | Offer one-click sustainable **alternatives** | Your “Find alternatives” button worked; make it persistent under the Add-to-Cart button. |
| **D** | Match discounts with eco nudges | “5 % off *and* 30 % lower carbon” blends top-ranked price salience with sustainability. |
| **E** | Keep jargon shallow | Replace “PTC heating element” with “quick-heat ceramic (safer & lasts longer)”; users flagged spec lines only when phrased plainly. |

| Ziran ID | Feature Priority | Reasoning |
|--------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **ARXBP** | 1\) **Price** 2) Product description 3) Reviews (pictures also mentioned) | Wanted to know cost up-front; description “introduces the product”; reviews help judge quality before buying. |
| **1S2SE** | 1\) **Reviews** 2) Return/Exchange info 3) Discounts | Trusts peer feedback; wants a clear path to return items that “aren’t good”; likes to save money via promotions. |
| **2W7HO** | 1\) **Photos** 2) Price 3) Ease of site navigation / categories | Images attract clicks; price must be “acceptable, not too expensive”; prefers pages that make it easy to find items. |
| **4XGN4** | 1\) **Product image** 2) Clearly shown price 3) Buyer-posted photos in reviews | Needs to *see* the item and its cost; relies on real-life pictures for authenticity. |
| **BPDSA** | 1\) **Shade/Color selector** 2) Price & discounts 3) Reviews | Lip cosmetics choice hinges on the right shade; checks deals; uses reviews for finer details. |
| **V7W8A** | 1\) **Photos** 2) Price 3) Size availability | Visual appeal first, then affordability; must confirm the size will fit. |
| **6E5N5** | 1\) **Price / loyalty-coin offers** 2) Promo details (accumulate & earn) 3) Product description | Interested in total out-of-pocket cost and momo-coin perks; still reads basics about the bag. |
| **6N9ZO** | 1\) **Usage & safety instructions** 2) Detailed specs & brand intro 3) Manufacturing country | An electrical item: wants to know how to use it safely, what it’s made of, and where it’s made. |
| **17LSR** | 1\) **Price** 2) Pictures 3) Reviews | Re-ordered her answer to stress price first, visuals second, testimony third. |
| **ANGZQ** | 1\) **Pictures** 2) Price 3) Reviews | Looks for visual appeal, good price, then social proof. |
| **C5LGY** | 1\) **Picture** 2) Price 3) Product name (quick ID) | Needs an image and cost immediately; name confirms model/version. |
| **1E9NE** | 1\) **Clear text next to images** 2) Product content & price 3) Purchase / instalment options | Wants concise specs alongside pictures; price clarity; evaluates payment plans or bank promos. |
| **9J97Q** | 1\) **Price** 2) Style/Color 3) Reviews & size chart | Cost leads; must like the look; checks fit and peer feedback. |
| **62WEN** | 1\) **Pictures** 2) Text description 3) Comments | Visual first, then skim details, finally read what others think. |

| **CBYNQ** | 1\) **Price / discounts & coins** 2) Product description 3) Compliance / warning notices | Price & perks matter; still reads description; safety/compliance warnings can become deal-breakers. |

### Known Issues

-   The Green Filter (Ziran) Chrome Extension is unable to record activity due to browser security restrictions for plugins.
-   Meanwhile, the web-only version at "ai.ziran.tw" (without direct access to user's screen), can record user activity.

### Notable Quotes from In-Person Testing

> “But I didn’t think that maybe the facial mask could contain some unknown plant extracts and chemical preservatives.”, anonymous student at Tainan Chang Jung Christian University (CJCU)

> “Since I was young, they often said… if something is made locally, the carbon footprint won’t be as high.”, anonymous student at National Pingtung University of Science and Technology (NPUST)

> “It gives me more choices.”, anonymous student at Tainan Southern Taiwan University of Science and Technology (STUST)

> “I hadn’t thought that the final use and disposal… would also affect carbon emissions.”, anonymous student at Tainan University of Technology (STUST)

> “What I see now is that it has listed the carbon footprint… it listed it very detailedly.”, anonymous student at Tainan National Cheng Kung University (NCKU)

> “I don’t care, I just look at the price, see what else there is, and then buy it directly.”, anonymous student at Chiayi National Chung Cheng University (CCU)

> “You can understand the product better. Before buying, you’ll know its info in more detail and what happens after you buy it...”, anonymous student at Tainan National Cheng Kung University (NCKU)

### Notable Quotes from Self-Testing (Survey)

Apart from the in-person testing, there were also over 100 college students who tested the Green Filter app on their own and reported their ideas in a survey. Here' are some excerpts.

| \# | Question | User Reasoning |
|-----|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | **“Which eco-info would you like your AI buddy to show?”** | “Before I buy anything I want to check the product’s transport distance (is it local food?), how green the company’s manufacturing is, how well its workers are treated, my own monthly environmental score, and ways I can push the brands I support to become even greener—all while chatting with the AI.” |
| 2 | **Optional comments** | “I’ve heard of *carbon accounts*. People are economically rational: if going green brings no monetary return, motivation stays weak. Embedding a carbon-account system into the economy would give consumers a real incentive to choose green products and would strengthen sustainable investment.” |
| 3 | **“Why did you click that feature?”** | “I expected alternative products to pop out on the same page, not jump to a new one. And the map drew a huge red line from Taiwan to Europe to show transport distance—even though I was buying a Taiwanese brand—so I got confused.” |
| 4 | **“Other options you want”** | “Please curate sustainable habits I can *actually* adopt—like zero-waste shops near my neighborhood. Google Maps keeps showing me stores that are already closed.” |
| 5 | **Most useful Green Filter feature** | “1) Everything is in one interface, no need for extra tabs. 2) Even if the data isn’t 100 % accurate, it pushes me to dig deeper. 3) The real-time chat includes pictures and extra links.” |
| 6 | **Least useful feature** | “In general the functions are handy, but the Q&A → Green Shopping → Question 7 is least helpful because I live in Taoyuan and stay in northern Taiwan. Adding north-area info would be better.” |
| 7 | **Biggest worry** | “The world feels increasingly out of control—wars, social division, info chaos, mental-health issues. Environmental degradation is part of it: over-production and consumption that trade resources for capital.” |
| 8 | **Preferred AI interaction style** | “Ask me things I don’t know, or help correct my English writing.” |
| 9 | **How students can influence companies** | “Young people are the main fast-consumption group. When they start caring and acting on environmental issues, company profits feel it, forcing firms to rethink manufacturing or confront labor rights.” |
| 10 | **Reason for boycotting a company** | “Food-safety scandals, and after they were convicted the firm showed no remorse—using loopholes and splitting its brands so consumers wouldn’t realize it’s the same management.” |
| 11 | **Trusted brand** | “Fresh Milk Village (*Xian-Niu-Fang*) — <https://www.bettermilk.com.tw/”> |
| 12 | **Biggest influence on eco attitude** | “Documentaries on ecological collapse—melting ice, desertification, grassland retreat, forest fires—make me reflect on humanity’s impact.” |

### Example Interview: 25 December 2024

Location: Taichung, National Chung Hsing University (NCHU) Anonymous Tester Code: \[3G1RL\]

| Speaker | Content |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Interviewer** | This app is part of my thesis about sustainability. First, may I record our conversation? |
| **Participant** | Uh, yes. |
| **Interviewer** | Have you used Momo before? |
| **Participant** | Yes. |
| **Interviewer** | Which platform do you use most, Momo or Shopee? |
| **Participant** | I use Shopee more often. |
| **Interviewer** | What kind of things do you usually buy online? |
| **Participant** | On Momo I once bought a set of speakers. |
| **Interviewer** | Anything you want to shop for right now? |
| **Participant** | Maybe some movies… but let me browse shoes instead. |
| **Interviewer** | Sure, pick any item. |
| **Participant** | (Searches) Found a pair of Timberland boat shoes. |
| **Interviewer** | Why that model? |
| **Participant** | I have eyed this pair for a long time and it looks good when others wear it. |
| **Interviewer** | Let us open my prototype overlay. What do you notice first? |
| **Participant** | The company score says forty five, which feels low, so maybe it is not very eco friendly. |
| **Interviewer** | The green tab shows “Reduce carbon emission thirty eight percent”. What does that mean to you? |
| **Participant** | It lists brands with lower carbon footprints so I could choose them instead. I have tried Timberland before; the others are new to me. |
| **Interviewer** | The purple tab suggests investment options. Thoughts? |
| **Participant** | It looks like I could invest in companies similar to Timberland, check stock prices and trends. I have never bought stocks though. |
| **Interviewer** | If Apple scored badly on the environment, would you switch brands? |
| **Participant** | I would research alternatives. Environmental impact matters to me. |
| **Interviewer** | Try the “Ask AI” button. |
| **Participant** | (Types) “How much carbon does this product emit?” The answer breaks down production, packaging, transport, even end of life disposal. I never considered water and electricity used during use. |
| **Interviewer** | Which part of the overlay feels most useful? |
| **Participant** | The detailed material and ESG section, environmental and labor issues, plus the alternative brands list. |
| **Interviewer** | Any information missing before you decide? |
| **Participant** | Safety data and warranty, especially for products used near the face; also clearer brand logos and Chinese names. |
| **Interviewer** | At the top there is a code. Please read it aloud. |
| **Participant** | Three G one R L. |
| **Interviewer** | Could you take a photo of the most important screen and write that code on the card? |
| **Participant** | (Takes photo and writes code) Done. |
| **Interviewer** | Last question, will the sustainability data change your purchase? |
| **Participant** | I might still buy these shoes if I really love them, but I will think twice and compare with greener options first. |
| **Interviewer** | Great. Thanks for your help today. |
| **Participant** | No problem. |

#### May 1

Notes: *Professor Feedback*: 1st of May Prof. suggestion - make connection between biodiversity and production and consumption clearer - what is the incentive for companies to share their data?

my own idea: like the switch of going from traditional banking with ATM machines on the street (or even the physical bank office) to online banking with mobile payments.

Hypothesis: ESG accessibility can push companies to increase production standards.

What if you can see ESG in near-realtime such as the stock market price?

I can imagine ESG derivative product like Siemens gamesa

AI can help integrate ESG derivatives into daily life to drive ESG adoption

"effective altruism (EA)"

"Blockchain technology can improve price transparency in product distribution by allowing consumers to know the exact pricing from raw materials to distributors to suppliers."
