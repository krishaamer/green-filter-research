## Interview Template

This is the basic interview script, which was used with small modifications at each interview.

On Momo:

-   What is a brand that you like'd or would like to buy - search - please pick a product (or search again)
-   After reaching Momo product page: what do you notice on this page?
-   What kind of information is important for you on this page?
-   Do you notice anything else?
-   (If the user doesn't notice the green filter, direct their attention to it and ask: what do you think this does?)
-   Would you click on it - if the user says yes, continue - if the user says no, make note and continue
-   As the extension generates a response: what do you think about this content?
-   Is there any information that you consider important?
-   Anything else you see that you think looks special
-   Do you see anywhere you can click?
-   Would you click on it? - if yes, continue - if no, make note, and continue
-   Explain: due to the limitation of the prototype, the test will continue on a separate page where you can ask questions
-   Is there anything you would like to ask the helper?
-   Notice if the user picks from sample questions
-   Remind the user they can come up with their own question
-   As the AI is generating content ask: do you see any information in this content
-   Did you know this before or is there any info you didn't know before? make note.
-   Front page: explain the helper takes into account your personal info and goals.
-   Ask: what kind of information do you think important to share with the helper?

## 2nd Wave of Testing (Fall 2024 - Spring 2025) - Prototype

Interviews and testing survey were conducted anonymously in hopes to have more honest responses from the responders.

-   32 anonymous gen-z participants in face-to face interviews
-   100+ anonymous self-testing participants
-   Testing is anonymous

### Testing Summary

In-person interviews highlighted that participants generally appreciated the transparency provided by the Green Filter app regarding sustainability of products. Interviewees mentioned that the visibility of *"Material Sustainability"* and the historical and environmental impact of products influenced their perception and purchasing intentions, sometimes causing them to reconsider previously unquestioned consumption habits. Participants were particularly intrigued by the comprehensive information on carbon emissions, labor issues, and potential health risks from certain ingredients, emphasizing that such details were rarely accessible in typical shopping experiences. Additionally, participants valued AI-generated comparative data that offered alternative sustainable brands and products, which helped them better understand environmental impacts and make more informed choices.

However, usability issues surfaced regarding terminology and interface clarity. Some users misunderstood the labeling related to financial savings and carbon emission reductions, indicating the importance of precise and intuitive wording in Chinese.

### Known Issues

-   The Green Filter (Ziran) Chrome Extension is unable to record activity due to browser security restrictions for plugins.
-   Meanwhile, the web-only version at "ai.ziran.tw" (without direct access to user's screen), can record user activity.

### Example Interview: 25 December 2024

Location: Taichung, National Chung Hsing University (NCHU) Anonymous Tester Code: \[3G1RL\]

| Speaker | Content |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Interviewer** | This app is part of my thesis about sustainability. First, may I record our conversation? |
| **Participant** | Uh, yes. |
| **Interviewer** | Have you used Momo before? |
| **Participant** | Yes. |
| **Interviewer** | Which platform do you use most, Momo or Shopee? |
| **Participant** | I use Shopee more often. |
| **Interviewer** | What kind of things do you usually buy online? |
| **Participant** | On Momo I once bought a set of speakers. |
| **Interviewer** | Anything you want to shop for right now? |
| **Participant** | Maybe some movies… but let me browse shoes instead. |
| **Interviewer** | Sure, pick any item. |
| **Participant** | (Searches) Found a pair of Timberland boat shoes. |
| **Interviewer** | Why that model? |
| **Participant** | I have eyed this pair for a long time and it looks good when others wear it. |
| **Interviewer** | Let us open my prototype overlay. What do you notice first? |
| **Participant** | The company score says forty five, which feels low, so maybe it is not very eco friendly. |
| **Interviewer** | The green tab shows “Reduce carbon emission thirty eight percent”. What does that mean to you? |
| **Participant** | It lists brands with lower carbon footprints so I could choose them instead. I have tried Timberland before; the others are new to me. |
| **Interviewer** | The purple tab suggests investment options. Thoughts? |
| **Participant** | It looks like I could invest in companies similar to Timberland, check stock prices and trends. I have never bought stocks though. |
| **Interviewer** | If Apple scored badly on the environment, would you switch brands? |
| **Participant** | I would research alternatives. Environmental impact matters to me. |
| **Interviewer** | Try the “Ask AI” button. |
| **Participant** | (Types) “How much carbon does this product emit?” The answer breaks down production, packaging, transport, even end of life disposal. I never considered water and electricity used during use. |
| **Interviewer** | Which part of the overlay feels most useful? |
| **Participant** | The detailed material and ESG section, environmental and labor issues, plus the alternative brands list. |
| **Interviewer** | Any information missing before you decide? |
| **Participant** | Safety data and warranty, especially for products used near the face; also clearer brand logos and Chinese names. |
| **Interviewer** | At the top there is a code. Please read it aloud. |
| **Participant** | Three G one R L. |
| **Interviewer** | Could you take a photo of the most important screen and write that code on the card? |
| **Participant** | (Takes photo and writes code) Done. |
| **Interviewer** | Last question, will the sustainability data change your purchase? |
| **Participant** | I might still buy these shoes if I really love them, but I will think twice and compare with greener options first. |
| **Interviewer** | Great. Thanks for your help today. |
| **Participant** | No problem. |

## 1st Wave of Testing (Spring 2024) - Prototype

Semi-structured interviews were conducted in Chinese. The interviewer (me) took notes of the interviews. Some gaps in the data exist due to the limited chinese language skills of the interviewer (me).

#### May 1

Notes: *Professor Feedback*: 1st of May Prof. suggestion - make connection between biodiversity and production and consumption clearer - what is the incentive for companies to share their data?

my own idea: like the switch of going from traditional banking with ATM machines on the street (or even the physical bank office) to online banking with mobile payments.

Hypothesis: ESG accessibility can push companies to increase production standards.

What if you can see ESG in near-realtime such as the stock market price?

I can imagine ESG derivative product like siemens gamesa

AI can help integrate esg derivatives into daily life to drive esg adoption

"effective altruism (EA)"

"Blockchain technology can improve price transparency in product distribution by allowing consumers to know the exact pricing from raw materials to distributors to suppliers."
