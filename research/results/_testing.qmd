Notes: *Professor Feedback*:
1st of May Prof. suggestion - make connection between biodiversity and production and consumption clearer - what is the incentive for companies to share their data?

my own idea: like the switch of going from traditional banking with ATM machines on the street (or even the physical bank office) to online banking with mobile payments.

Hypothesis: ESG accessibility can push companies to increase production standards.

What if you can see ESG in near-realtime such as the stock market price?

I can imagine ESG derivative product like siemens gamesa

AI can help integrate esg derivatives into daily life to drive esg adoption

"effective altruism (EA)"

"Blockchain technology can improve price transparency in product distribution by allowing consumers to know the exact pricing from raw materials to distributors to suppliers."

## 2nd Wave of Testing (Fall 2024 - Spring 2025) - Prototype

Interviews and testing survey were conducted anonymously in hopes to have more honest responses from the responders.

* 32 anonymous gen-z participants in face-to face interviews
* 100+ anonymous self-testing participants
* Testing is anonymous

### Testing Summary

In-person interviews highlighted that participants generally appreciated the transparency provided by the Green Filter app regarding sustainability of products. Interviewees mentioned that the visibility of *"Material Sustainability"* and the historical and environmental impact of products influenced their perception and purchasing intentions, sometimes causing them to reconsider previously unquestioned consumption habits. Participants were particularly intrigued by the comprehensive information on carbon emissions, labor issues, and potential health risks from certain ingredients, emphasizing that such details were rarely accessible in typical shopping experiences. Additionally, participants valued AI-generated comparative data that offered alternative sustainable brands and products, which helped them better understand environmental impacts and make more informed choices.

However, usability issues surfaced regarding terminology and interface clarity. Some users misunderstood the labeling related to financial savings and carbon emission reductions, indicating the importance of precise and intuitive wording in Chinese. 

### Known Issues
* The Green Filter (Ziran) Chrome Extension is unable to record activity due to browser security restrictions for plugins.
* Meanwhile, the web-only version at "ai.ziran.tw" (without direct access to user's screen), can record user activity.
