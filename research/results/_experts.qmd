## First Wave of Experts (2023-2024)

Analysis of recorded conversation from 7 experts. Thematic content analysis using ATLAS.ti for labeling/coding the data for grounded theory. Conversations were recorded and transcribed using Google Meet, Fireflies AI, and WhatsApp. Labeling and thematic analysis was performed using Atlas.ti. Visualisations were produced using Atlas.ti and Python.

For thematic analysis, I conducted 2 types of coding: -

-   Unsupervised AI-coding which discovered topics and patterns in the interviews.

-   Intentional AI-coding, directed by my own judgment towards keywords most relevant to developing my AI assistant.
