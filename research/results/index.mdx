Results

Expected Findings

During the preparation of this research proposal, I conducted a
preliminary round of face-to-face interviews using 21 open-ended probing
questions using a convenience sampling of NCKU students on campus
between ages 19 and 29, a total of 12 respondents. The interviews lasted
between 9 and 21 minutes and were conducted to get some initial feedback
on my research idea, the respondents’ daily routines, app usage,
feelings towards financial questions, including investing, relationship
with nature, and environmental sustainability. These preliminary
conversations led me to emphasize more on the financial journey, i.e.,
to consider the importance of the shopping, savings, and payments apps
students already use daily, which could serve as an entry point to
becoming an investor. I expect my future research findings to confirm
this initial idea and offer diverse ways and examples of what that path
could look like in practice.

Survey Overview

import from Ziran

A survey of Taiwanese college students (excludes overseas
Chinese-speaking students as well as foreign students) covering
attitudes towards shopping, saving, investing, economy, nature,
sustainability, and AI.

Survey Oct. 13th - Nov. 3rd, 2023

-   2000 cards with a QR code printed out

-   Distribution conducted at 8 universities (handing out the cards)

-   1289 people started the survey, 518 quit

-   771 people completed the whole survey

-   Data after filtering: 675 people aged 18-26 (Gen-Z), Taiwanese,
    current students in BA (large majority), MA (small minority) or PhD
    level (very few respondents)

-   36 likert fields (5-point scale) used for clustering the students
    into 3 personas with K-means clustering

-   14 product features (multiple-choice) used for K-modes clustering

-   4 choice experiments

-   2 option ranking questions

-   10 text fields used to enrich the personas

Data Analysis

-   Use K-Means clustering for survey data. K-means clustering is
    similar to vector distances for similarity used in large-language
    models (LLMs) word embeddings and deep learning.

Findings

-   Literature: AI assistants should integrate with Digital Product
    Passports
-   Literature: AI assistants should show carbon label data.
-   Literature: AI assistants should avoid taking ESG at face value
    (because it’s a really low bar) and integrate other metrics such as
    B Corp.
-   Literature: AI assistants should
-   Literature: Do not make another investing app, make a sustainability
    filter for excising investing platforms.
-   Literature: College students can support extended producer
    responsibility

How might AI assistants empower regenerative shopping, saving, and
investing?

Display the ESG, EPR, B-Corp, etc, etc credentials for each product and
investment. EPR and B-Corp are success stories which should be
highlighted while ESG is largely discredited. There are many existing
and ongoing approaches to sustainability. The best approach might be to
plug into excising system and communities and legislation to support and
empower them.

How might one design an intuitive sustainable shopping, saving,
investing app?

-   Apple Watch app

What app features might college students rate as the highest priority?

-   Autopilot

How might one visualize ecological impact in digital product design?

-   Accuracy is more important for human trust than actual impact.

95.9% used a mobile device, 75,5% using an iOS device (iPhone), 20.8%
using an Android device. design implication: should design mobile app
(but apple is so restrictive)

RQ 1

-   “the AI companion is informed by the latest scientific insights and
    can provide accurate, evidence-based recommendations .”
-   “The AI is designed to offer personalized guidance by analyzing
    complex environmental data and translating it into user-friendly
    information, helping students make more sustainable choices in their
    daily lives .”
-   “It explores various AI interaction designs, including chatbots,
    voice assistants, and virtual avatars, to find the most engaging and
    supportive formats for college students .”
-   “address the “attitude-behavior gap” among college students by
    providing tools that make sustainable financial actions more
    convenient and impactful. ”

RQ 2

-   “provide real-time information about the sustainability of products
    and companie”
-   “AI companion includes features for identifying and investing in
    sustainable companies. This involves providing data on companies’
    environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices, and
    facilitating investments in green bonds and sustainable funds .”
-   “shopping-as-investing,” where the AI links the act of purchasing
    sustainable products with investing in companies that produce these
    products, effectively merging consumer and investor roles .”

RQ 3 todo
