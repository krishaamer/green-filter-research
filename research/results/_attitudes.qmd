| *“Taiwan’s economic goal is growth.”* | 19% | 31% | **50%** | Half the college students see GDP growth as the main national KPI. |
| *“Environmental degradation is a prerequisite for that growth.”* | **39%** | 26% | 34% | Split opinions: a large percentage of the respondents rejects this trade-off, but 1/3 thinks wrecking nature is the price of progress. |
| *“Taiwan’s growth helps protect the environment.”* | **40%** | 31% | 29% | Skeptic mode: more students *disagree* than buy the “growth = green” story. |
