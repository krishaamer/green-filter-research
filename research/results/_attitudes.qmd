### Economy

| Question | Disagree 1-2 | Neutral 3 | Agree 4-5 | Interpretation |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|----------------------------|
| *“Taiwan’s economic goal is growth.”* | 19% | 31% | **50%** | Half the college students see GDP growth as the main national KPI. |
| *“Environmental degradation is a prerequisite for that growth.”* | **39%** | 26% | 34% | Split opinions: a large percentage of the respondents rejects this trade-off, but 1/3 thinks wrecking nature is the price of progress. |
| *“Taiwan’s growth helps protect the environment.”* | **40%** | 31% | 29% | Skeptic mode: more students *disagree* than buy the “growth = green” story. |

### Environmental Knowledge Ranking Experiment

Testing student knowledge about the environment. College students see coral reefs, tropical rainforests, and wetlands as the most sensitive ecosystems, aligning with global climate narratives. However, the long tail of unique combos suggests mixed ecological knowledge and a strong opportunity to educate and personalize ecosystem awareness, especially in a Taiwanese context.

#| label: fig-survey-envir-know
