## First Wave of Experts (2023-2024)

Analysis of recorded conversation from 7 experts. Thematic content
analysis using ATLAS.ti for labeling/coding the data for grounded
theory. Conversations were recorded and transcribed using Google Meet,
Fireflies AI, and WhatsApp. Labeling and thematic analysis was performed
using Atlas.ti. Visualisations were produced using Atlas.ti and Python.

For thematic analysis, I conducted 2 types of coding: -

-   Unsupervised AI-coding which discovered topics and patterns in the
    interviews.

-   Intentional AI-coding, directed by my own judgment towards keywords
    most relevant to developing my AI assistant.

## Thematic Codes

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[1] }} />

## Overall Expert Feedback Summary

In the overall Sankey diagram every coded quote from the 7 expert
interviewees (left column) flows into the 7 overarching themes on the
right; each ribbon represents 1 excerpt, with its color matching the
theme it was assigned to, and the cumulative ribbon width reveals how
often that theme appeared. Purple “Design Principles” and yellow
“Systems Thinking” are thickest (they dominated the discussions), while
slimmer blue “AI Strategies” and peach “Simplicity” flows indicate they
were discussed less; the even spread of ribbons across interviewees
confirms that all participants contributed to nearly every theme,
underscoring a balanced coverage and validating the qualitative coding.

consumer behavior, and sustainability, emphasizing the need for
innovative approaches to engage users effectively while addressing their
concerns about product origins and environmental impact.

#### (6) Simplicity {#simplicity}

This line of conversation discusses the origins for the research,
stemming from a desire to create a product that allows users to easily
access information about the sustainability of products they purchase,
inspired by the science fiction show Star Trek, indicating a wish for a
scanner-like tool that could provide instant information on product
quality.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[7] }} />

The experts brainstorm ways to enhance the user interface and make it
more intuitive, such as using *familiar product categories* for testing
purposes.

Chen-Ying Huang highlights the role of AI in analyzing products and
