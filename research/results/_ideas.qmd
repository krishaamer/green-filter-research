## Early Feature Ideas

The following early feature ideas occurred to me during the literature review process. They are naive and meant to allow thinking in terms of *what-if* a particular user experience was possible. These prototypes were not tested with users directly and rather formed a basis for directing the questions asked in a potential user survey.

Early Ideas for Interfaces / Scenarios / Product Features

Show all the different prototypes just likes architects do. And then defend why I chose the one I did. For NW make a Loom with the interfaces and talk about them?

I developed a number of early prototypes to visualize product feature ideas.

What's on the intersection of College Students, Sustainability, Investing, Data-Driven Design and Artificial Intelligence (AI)? AI-Driven Sustainable Investment Tools.

The app aims to address the market failure by providing consumers sufficient sustainability information on the goods, services and investments.

resource depletion

and adopt the doughnut economy as my overarching theoretical framework

Humans are successful because of our adaptability. The study suggests tools to adapt to our current reality.

United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration

Hypothesis: extractive business practices reduce college students trust, regenerative business practices create trust among college students towards the company.

Provided there is awareness

How can sustainability-minded college students find companies that meet their expectations, standards and requirements?

Make a public profile of my carbon consumption!!! Like on Commons.

Shop

Save

Invest

Build closer relationships with sustainability-focused companies

Sales funnel for eco-focused products

The eco-friendly market is fragmented

Build trust, clarity, transparency, and honesty

Make a 'Sustainability Flywheel' graphic, like that of Amazon's

Sustainability is fragmented. How can billions of people build closer relationships with sustainability-focused companies based on honesty and transparency? A research project for designing a sustainable shopping, savings, and investing companion.

TODO: Make a table showing research results translated to design decisions

Your Green Helper

Make some initial prototype? make YoutTbe video... hi, you have reached? spread... through ESTBan and others?

Currently CO2 footprint calculators ask you a couple of questions and give a ballpark estimate. Does it make sense to track sustainability on a more nuanced level, like Apple Health, in order to encourage sustainable behavior?

### Susan (Sustainability Conversation)

*What if* I could have a chat like this at the supermarket? Imagine what questions I would ask before buying a product. AI: "Kris, do you still remember Coca Cola's packaging is a large contributor to ocean plastic? You even went to a beach cleanup!" Me: "That's so sad but it's tasty!" AI. "Remember your values. Would you like to start saving for investing in insect farms in Indonesia instead? Predicted return 4% per year, according to analysts A and B." If I'm not so sure, I could continue the conversation. Me: "Tell me more" AI: "A recent UN study says, the planet needs to grow 70% more food in the next 40 years. Experts from 8 investment companies predict growth for this category of assets." Me: "Thanks for reminding me who I am" ... Moments later. AI: "This shampoo is made by Unilever, which is implicated in deforestation in Indonesia according to reporting by World Forest Watch. Would you consider buying another brand instead? They have a higher ESG rating."

Example Suggestions of the AI companion:

* *"Don't buy a car, use a car sharing service instead to save XYZ CO~2~eq. Services available near you: Bolt, Uber, Line Taxi"*

* *"Use a refillable shampoo bottle to save XYZ plastic pollution"*

* *"Call your local politician to nudge them to improve bicycle paths and reduce cars in your neighborhood. Over the past 2 years, you city has experienced an increase of cars from 290 cars per capita to 350 cars per capita."*

Speculative scenario of an interaction between a human user and a robo-advisor through the interface of chat messages in the context of retail shopping for daily products.

### Sunday Market

*What if* I could go to the Sunday market with other people who care about sustainability? First prototype (based on literature review) called HappyGreen's for going to the organic Sunday Market with friends. Choose industries of focus? Fashion, Food, etc?

### How Far?

*What if* the exact distance traveled by a product to reach me was clearly displayed during shopping? Seeing precise transportation distances and associated emissions could immediately clarify the environmental impact of buying local versus imported goods. Such transparency might encourage consumers to prioritize local and sustainable sourcing.

## Country Profiles

*What if* I knew my country's top pollution sources? I could instantly access detailed insights into my countryâ€™s primary sources of pollution? Having clear, accessible data on national environmental challenges might empower consumers to support policies, businesses, and lifestyle changes that address critical sustainability issues.

## Know Your Company (KYC)

*What if* I could KYC the companies I interact with? This is a common practice for banks, they need to KYC "Know Your Client". As a consumer, could I approach companies in a similar way to banks - using "Know Your Company" (KYC) for daily interactions with businesses? Possibly detailed transparency about corporate sustainability, ethics, and practices would enable consumers to engage only with companies whose values align closely with my own. Similary, *What if* I could "Speak Truth to Power", affecting companies with truth? Consolidate user feedback for companies.

### CO~2~eq Flex

*What if* I could show off how much CO~2~eq I have retired? What if I could showcase my contributions to reducing carbon emissions, similar to how fitness achievements are shared? A visual display or "badge" reflecting my environmental impact could encourage others, creating a ripple effect of positive behavior and raising community awareness about personal sustainability efforts.

### Sustainability Watch

*What if* I could see all my sustainability data on a wearable device in the right context? My wearable device could provide instant, contextually relevant sustainability data throughout my day? Imagine checking my watch during shopping or commuting and instantly seeing personalized, actionable insights that help me make more eco-friendly decisions seamlessly integrated into my daily routine.

### Narrative Layouts

*What if* I spent 5 minutes every day with a guide who could help me make more eco-friendly choices? How should the layout storyline be structured? Well itâ€™s like Strava (that running app) for sustainabilityâ€¦ or if you have heard of Welltory. I believe sustainable choices that would improve my life.. be it what I consume, save, invest, etc.. so Iâ€™m trying to design an app around this idea. I'm basically building the UX of AI.. focused on sustainability. How should the layout storyline be structured?

### Shopping Divest

*What if* I you could build a community based on what I buy? Or join existing communities based explicitly on sustainable consumption habits? By sharing my purchasing choices and sustainability experiences with others, perhaps we could collectively amplify the positive impact of our eco-conscious decisions.
