## Saving

### Saving Frequency

The following charts are based on the 你/妳覺得目前有任何投資嗎？ and 你/妳覺得目前有任何投資嗎？ boolean (Yes / No) fields. The data shows correlation between saving levels and investing: the students with higher level of saving invest more. 

```{python}
#| label: fig-survey-corr-invest-bar
#| fig-cap: "Correlation Between Saving Levels and Investing (Sankey)"
#| fig-scap: "Correlation Between Saving Levels and Investing (Sankey)"
saving_to_investing_bars()
```

The same data plotted as a Sankey chart.

```{python}
#| label: fig-survey-corr-invest-sankey
#| fig-cap: "Correlation Between Saving Levels and Investing (Sankey)"
#| fig-scap: "Correlation Between Saving Levels and Investing (Sankey)"
saving_to_investing_sankey()
```
