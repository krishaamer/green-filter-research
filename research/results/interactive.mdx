## Google Chrome Extentsion App Installs

While Google is the most popular browser with 3 billion users,
extensions are a relatively less known feature of the browser. Most
popular extensions are Grammarly, for Taiwanese students End Note is
familiar.

However it’s only available for computers (extensions don’t run on
phones and tablets).
