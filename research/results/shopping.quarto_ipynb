        "| *Will you buy a car within 7 years?* | The mode is **1**, plus decent counts at **2**. A clear majority of respondents do **not** expect to purchase a car soon. My interpretation: maybe they’re fine with their scooter (!= car, see the question about how they arrive to school), use public transit or are just broke students. |\n",
        "| *Will you buy a house within 7 years?* | Even more lopsided: a mountain at **1**. Housing feels out of reach for the respondents. |\n",

        "| *Do you support a meat tax?* | Centered on **3**, with noticeable flanks at 2 and 4. Opinion is split; lots are neutral, some yay, some nay. Again, this might indicate respondents don't fully understand the question. |\n",
        "| *Do you care about the living conditions of chickens you consume?* | Mode at **3**, healthy bump at **4**. People lean caring, but not super strongly. |\n",
        "| *Do you avoid eating meat?* | Tall stack on **1**, smaller on **2**. So most **do not** avoid meat; only a sliver sits at 4-5. |\n",
