## Shopping Attitudes

Interpreting the findings.

| \# | Question | Interpretation |
|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1 | *Would you still buy a tomato if you suspected it was picked by forced labor?* | Most respondents chose **2** or **1** which I interpret as *“Nope, I wouldn’t buy it.”* - only a small fraction of the respondents choosing 4-5 would ignore the labor issue. |
| 2 | *Do you care about food safety?* | The choices peaks at **4**, then **5**. Nearly everyone is on the caring side; indifference and denial are tiny. |
| 3 | *Will you buy a car within 7 years?* | The mode is **1**, plus decent counts at **2**. A clear majority of respondents do **not** expect to purchase a car soon. My interpretation: maybe they’re fine with their scooter (!= car, see the question about how they arrive to school), use public transit or are just broke students. |
| 4 | *Will you buy a house within 7 years?* | Even more lopsided: a mountain at **1**. Housing feels out of reach for the respondents. |
| 5 | *Do you know if a product is environmentally friendly when shopping?* | Bell-ish curve peaking at **3-4**. People feel **some** awareness, but confidence isn’t universal. This might also reflect they don't fully understand the question. |
| 6 | *Do you think companies with environmental certifications are better?* | Strong skew right: bars climb from 3 → 4 → 5. The badge matters and most respondents see certified firms as the good guys. |
| 7 | *Do you support a meat tax?* | Centered on **3**, with noticeable flanks at 2 and 4. Opinion is split; lots are neutral, some yay, some nay. Again, this might indicate respondents don't fully understand the question. |
| 8 | *Do you care about the living conditions of chickens you consume?* | Mode at **3**, healthy bump at **4**. People lean caring, but not super strongly. |
| 9 | *Do you avoid eating meat?* | Tall stack on **1**, smaller on **2**. So most **do not** avoid meat; only a sliver sits at 4-5. |
| 10 | *Do you think your spending affects the environment?* | Big jump at **4**, next at **5**, tiny left tail. Consensus: “My wallet choices matter.” This is an important finding to justify *Green Filter*. |

### Boycott Count (Overall)

```{python}
#| label: fig-survey-student-boycott
#| fig-cap: "College Students Boycott Experience"
#| fig-scap: "College Students Boycott Experience"
boycott_count()
```

| Option                        | Count   | Share of sample |
|-------------------------------|---------|-----------------|
| **沒 有** – *Never boycotted* | **537** | \~61 %          |
| **有** – *Have boycotted*     | **339** | \~39 %          |

About 2 out of 5 college students have actively refused to buy from at least one brand, while a clear majority hasn’t taken that step.

| Response category | Count | Share of all students |
|------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| **No trusted brand**<br>(any variant of “none / don’t have / can’t think of one”) | **421** | **48 %** |
| **Have trust but didn’t name it**<br>(e.g., “有”) | 68 | 8 % |
| **Named a specific brand** | 387 | 44 % |
| *Total* | 876 | 100 % |

| Rank | Brand                          | Count | \% of all 876 |
|------|--------------------------------|-------|---------------|
| 1    | **義美 (I-Mei Foods)**         | 48    | 5.5 %         |
| 2    | **Apple**                      | 27    | 3.1 %         |
| 3    | MUJI                           | 14    | 1.6 %         |
| 4    | Nike                           | 11    | 1.3 %         |
| 5    | 光泉 (Kuang Chuan Dairy)       | 9     | 1.0 %         |
| 6    | 統一 (Uni-President)           | 7     | 0.8 %         |
| 7    | 里仁 (LiRen organic)           | 6     | 0.7 %         |
| 8    | NET (Taiwanese fashion chain)  | 5     | 0.6 %         |
| 9    | 主婦聯盟 (Moms in Union co-op) | 5     | 0.6 %         |
| 10   | 全聯 (PX Mart)                 | 4     | 0.5 %         |

Top-10 mentioned brands (after normalising obvious duplicates). After the top three, the distribution flattens quickly; in total, 248 different brand names were entered. High “no-brand” rate (48 %): Students are sceptical and reserve trust; they need a strong safety/ethics signal before committing loyalty.

## Choice Experiments

```{python}
#| label: fig-survey-student-shopping-choice
#| fig-cap: "College Student Shopping Choice Experiment"
#| fig-scap: "College Student Shopping Choice Experiment"
visualize_shopping_data()
```

| Product & Attributes | Choices | Respondents | Share | Interpretation |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Tomatoes** (Price × Forced-labor Risk) | 500 TWD/kg (5% risk) | **507** | **58%** | **Sweet-spot:** most college students accept a mid price if risk is \< 10%. |
|  | 300 TWD/kg (15% risk) | 301 | 34% | **Price-first:** about 1/3 of the respondents sacrifice ethics for a 40% discount. |
|  | 700 TWD/kg (2% risk) | 68 | 8% | **Ethical Premium:** fewer than 1/10 of the respondents will pay +40% for the safest pick. |
| **Milk** (Price Only) | 85 TWD | **363** | **41%** | Slightly higher-priced carton wins; may signal perceived quality. |
|  | 72 TWD | 339 | 39% | Hardcore bargain hunters—pure price play. |
|  | 108 TWD | 174 | 20% | Small niche is fine paying +27 % (brand / organic cue?). |
| **Eggs** (Price × Animal-welfare Label) | 66 TWD / 10 eggs (no hen-welfare info) | **414** | **47%** | Baseline: half of the respondents choose the cheapest “unknown welfare” tray. |
|  | 102 TWD / 10 eggs (no hen-welfare info) | 269 | 31% | Some will pay +54% even without extra welfare signal (brand/quality?) |
|  | 160 TWD / 10 eggs (cage-free label) | 193 | 22% | About 1/5 of the respondents would pay +142% when hen welfare is certified. |
