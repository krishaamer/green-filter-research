## Shopping Attitudes

Interpreting the findings.

| \# | Question | Interpretation |
|----|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 1 | *Would you still buy a tomato if you suspected it was picked by forced labor?* | Most respondents chose **2** or **1** which I interpret as *“Nope, I wouldn’t buy it.”* - only a small fraction of the respondents choosing 4-5 would ignore the labor issue. |
| 2 | *Do you care about food safety?* | The choices peaks at **4**, then **5**. Nearly everyone is on the caring side; indifference and denial are tiny. |
| 3 | *Will you buy a car within 7 years?* | The mode is **1**, plus decent counts at **2**. A clear majority of respondents do **not** expect to purchase a car soon. My interpretation: maybe they’re fine with their scooter (!= car, see the question about how they arrive to school), use public transit or are just broke students. |
| 4 | *Will you buy a house within 7 years?* | Even more lopsided: a mountain at **1**. Housing feels out of reach for the respondents. |
| 5 | *Do you know if a product is environmentally friendly when shopping?* | Bell-ish curve peaking at **3-4**. People feel **some** awareness, but confidence isn’t universal. This might also reflect they don't fully understand the question. |
| 6 | *Do you think companies with environmental certifications are better?* | Strong skew right: bars climb from 3 → 4 → 5. The badge matters and most respondents see certified firms as the good guys. |
| 7 | *Do you support a meat tax?* | Centered on **3**, with noticeable flanks at 2 and 4. Opinion is split; lots are neutral, some yay, some nay. Again, this might indicate respondents don't fully understand the question. |
| 8 | *Do you care about the living conditions of chickens you consume?* | Mode at **3**, healthy bump at **4**. People lean caring, but not super strongly. |
| 9 | *Do you avoid eating meat?* | Tall stack on **1**, smaller on **2**. So most **do not** avoid meat; only a sliver sits at 4-5. |
| 10 | *Do you think your spending affects the environment?* | Big jump at **4**, next at **5**, tiny left tail. Consensus: “My wallet choices matter.” This is an important finding to justify *Green Filter*. |
