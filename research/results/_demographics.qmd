```

| Cluster Type        | % of Extroverts   | % of Introverts   | Description                               |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| High eco-engagement | \~37% (Cluster 0) | \~33% (Cluster 2) | Strong sustainability, AI use, confidence |
| Moderate            | \~33% (Cluster 2) | \~45% (Cluster 1) | Interested but not deeply involved        |
| Low engagement      | \~30% (Cluster 1) | \~22% (Cluster 0) | Low scores across eco, AI, finance        |
