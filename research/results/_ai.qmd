### Likert-Based Clustering
AI-assistant feature choices per Likert-based Personas
```{python}
#| label: fig-ai-features-likert
#| fig-cap: "AI-Assistant Feature Choices per Likert-based Personas"
#| fig-scap: "AI-Assistant Feature Choices per Likert-based Personas"
likert_cluster_and_visualize()
```

This chart visualizes three distinct personas based on 36 likert answers: Eco-Friendly (n=340), Moderate (n=215), and Frugal (n=126) based on their overall sentiment profiles.
