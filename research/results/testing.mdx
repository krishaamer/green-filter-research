Doesn’t notice analysis button at first.

Would not click on “continue chat button”

Asked “why is it so expensive in taiwan”.

Considers report result useful.

Note: There’s dropoff on evey step of the user journey.

RQ: To what extend can shopping become and entry point for saving and
investing. RQ: Can shopping serve as an entry point for sustainable

-   investment help useless.. needs simpler intro - wants to see real
    cows - very curious abouut companes - wants to see profit
    percentage. why is margin so high if polluution is bad. - real
    environmental impact of the coompany.

06 may - Seeing factory photos is useful only if they are trustworthy
photos. Who will provide them? -

may 5

-   user: it looks like an ad

may 3

-   uses google to look for “fashion brand eco friendly”

-   thinks “goodonyou.eco” looks like a brand website

may3 - first looked for NET clothes but Momo doesn’t sell it - Looked
for Sony camera lens

1 may prof suggestion - make connection between biodibersity and
production and consumption clearer - what is the incentive for companies
to share their data?

my own idea: like the switch of going from traditional banking with ATM
machines on the street (or even the physica bank office) to online
banking with mobile payments

hypothesis: esg accessibility can push companies to increase production
standards

what if you can see ESG in near-realtime such as the stock market price

i can imagine esg derivative product like siemens gamesa

ai can help integrate esg derivatives into daily life to drive esg
adoption

“effective altruism (EA)”

“Blockchain technology can improve price transparency in product
distribution by allowing consumers to know the exact pricing from raw
materials to distributors to suppliers.”

Interviews and testing survey were conducted anonymously in hopes to
have more honest responses from the responders.

ziran chrome extension is unable to record activity due to browser
security restrictions for plugins

ai.ziran.tw record user activity

semi-structured interviews were conducted in chinese

the interviewer (me) took notes of the interviews

some gaps in the data exist due to the limited chinese language skills
of the interviewer (me)

basic interview script - momo: what is a brand that you like’d or would
like to buy - search - please pick a product (or search again) - on
product page: what do you notice on this page? - what kind of
information is important for you on this page? - do you notice anything
else - (if the user doesn’t notice the green filter, direct their
attention to it and ask: what do you think this does?) - would you click
on it - if the user says yes, continue - if thhe user says no, make note
and continue - as the extension generates a response: what do you think
about this content? - is there any information that you consider
important? - anything else you see that you think looks special - do you
see anywhere you can click? - would you click on it? - if yes,
continue - if no, make note, and continue - explain: due to the
limitation of the prototype, the test will continue on a separate page
where you can ask questions - is there anything you would like to ask
the helper? - notice if the user picks from sample questions - remind
the user they can come up with their own question - as the ai is
generating content ask: do you see any information in this content - did
you know this before or is there any info you didn’t know before? make
note. - front page: explain the helper takes into account your personal
info and goals. - ask: what kind of information do you think important
to share with the helper?

Tuesday 30. April 14:05-14:45 - 7CYQ6

Momo

Looks for Levis pants

Looks for recommendations on the sidebar

Looks at the photos

Looks at the price and options

Didn’t notice the helper as it looks like an ad

When helped

Ignores 社區支持： 購物 69% 儲蓄 80% 投資 65% as doesn’t know what these
mean

on ai.ziran

shares personal info:
四年後想考研究所，還不想工作，所以不會存到錢，希望可以考到台北的學校，每個月有兩萬生活費。

DJmoney

Still didn’t notice the helper

Doesn’t understand investing (Understands it’s Taiwanese stocks) so the
helper is useful for explaining new concepts

Monday 29. april 10:10-10.25 - Momo - buy new balance sneakers

DJmoney

wants compare EFTs

Monday 29. april 14:50-15:10 - Momo - buy apple iphone - bad internet -
app was slow - app crashed

green filter analysis on DJmoney seems more trustworthy than other 2 eft
sites

button placement is important (too low on other sites than djmoney)

Sunday 28. april 16:00 - momo: wants to buy ice cream
