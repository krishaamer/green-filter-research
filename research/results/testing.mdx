-   investment help useless.. needs simpler intro - wants to see real
    cows - very curious abouut companes - wants to see profit
    percentage. why is margin so high if polluution is bad. - real
    environmental impact of the coompany.

06 may - Seeing factory photos is useful only if they are trustworthy
photos. Who will provide them? -

may 5

-   user: it looks like an ad

may 3

-   uses google to look for “fashion brand eco friendly”

-   thinks “goodonyou.eco” looks like a brand website

may3 - first looked for NET clothes but Momo doesn’t sell it - Looked
for Sony camera lens

1 may prof suggestion - make connection between biodibersity and
production and consumption clearer - what is the incentive for companies
to share their data?

my own idea: like the switch of going from traditional banking with ATM
machines on the street (or even the physica bank office) to online
banking with mobile payments

hypothesis: esg accessibility can push companies to increase production
standards

what if you can see ESG in near-realtime such as the stock market price

i can imagine esg derivative product like siemens gamesa

ai can help integrate esg derivatives into daily life to drive esg
adoption

“effective altruism (EA)”

“Blockchain technology can improve price transparency in product
distribution by allowing consumers to know the exact pricing from raw
materials to distributors to suppliers.”

Interviews and testing survey were conducted anonymously in hopes to
have more honest responses from the responders.

ziran chrome extension is unable to record activity due to browser
security restrictions for plugins

ai.ziran.tw record user activity

semi-structured interviews were conducted in chinese

the interviewer (me) took notes of the interviews

some gaps in the data exist due to the limited chinese language skills
of the interviewer (me)

basic interview script - momo: what is a brand that you like’d or would
like to buy - search - please pick a product (or search again) - on
product page: what do you notice on this page? - what kind of
information is important for you on this page? - do you notice anything
else - (if the user doesn’t notice the green filter, direct their
attention to it and ask: what do you think this does?) - would you click
on it - if the user says yes, continue - if thhe user says no, make note
and continue - as the extension generates a response: what do you think
about this content? - is there any information that you consider
important? - anything else you see that you think looks special - do you
see anywhere you can click? - would you click on it? - if yes,
continue - if no, make note, and continue - explain: due to the
limitation of the prototype, the test will continue on a separate page
where you can ask questions - is there anything you would like to ask
the helper? - notice if the user picks from sample questions - remind
the user they can come up with their own question - as the ai is
generating content ask: do you see any information in this content - did
you know this before or is there any info you didn’t know before? make
note. - front page: explain the helper takes into account your personal
info and goals. - ask: what kind of information do you think important
to share with the helper?

Tuesday 30. April 14:05-14:45 - 7CYQ6

Momo

Looks for Levis pants

Looks for recommendations on the sidebar

Looks at the photos

Looks at the price and options

Didn’t notice the helper as it looks like an ad

When helped

Ignores 社區支持： 購物 69% 儲蓄 80% 投資 65% as doesn’t know what these
mean

on ai.ziran

shares personal info:
四年後想考研究所，還不想工作，所以不會存到錢，希望可以考到台北的學校，每個月有兩萬生活費。

DJmoney

https://www.moneydj.com/etf/x/basic/basic0004.xdjhtm?etfid=0050.tw

Still didn’t notice the helper

Doesn’t understand investing (Understands it’s Taiwanese stocks) so the
helper is useful for explaining new concepts

Monday 29. april 10:10-10.25 - Momo - buy new balance sneakers

DJmoney

wants compare EFTs

Monday 29. april 14:50-15:10 - Momo - buy apple iphone - bad internet -
app was slow - app crashed

green filter analysis on DJmoney seems more trustworthy than other 2 eft
sites

button placement is important (too low on other sites than djmoney)

Sunday 28. april 16:00 - momo: wants to buy ice cream

## 2nd Wave of Testing (Fall 2024 - Spring 2025) Prototype Testing results {#nd-wave-of-testing-fall-2024---spring-2025-prototype-testing-results}

TODO

-   32 anonymous gen-z participants in face-to face interviews
-   100+ anonymous self-testing participants

## Expert Feedback Results

Provide alternatives

Simplify text

Use images

Put a “New Feature” ad on the front page

Change 繼續討論 to something more actionable

I tried changing to “see alternatives”

## Ideas for Interfaces / Scenarios {#ideas-for-interfaces-scenarios}

Show all the different prototypes just likes architects do. And then
defend why I chose the one I did. For NW make a Loom with the interfaces
and talk about them?

## Prototypes of Product Features

I developed a number of early prototypes to visualize product feature
ideas.

What’s on the intersection of College Students, Sustainability,
Investing, Data-Driven Design and Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
AI-Driven Sustainable Investment Tools.

The app aims to address the market failure by providing consumers
sufficient sustainability information on the goods, services and
investments.

resource depletion

and adopt the doughnut economy as my overarching theoretical framework

Humans are successful because of our adaptability. The study suggests
tools to adapt to our current reality.

United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration

Hypothesis: extractive business practices reduce college students trust,
regenerative business practices create trust among college students
towards the company.

Provided there is awareness

How can sustainability-minded college students find companies that meet
their expectations, standards and requirements?

-   Make a public profile of my carbon consumption!!! Like on Commons.

-   Shop

-   Save

-   Invest

-   Build closer relationships with sustainability-focused companies

-   Sales funnel for eco-focused products

-   The eco-friendly market is fragmented

-   Build trust, clarity, transparency, and honesty

-   Make a ‘Sustainability Flywheel’ graphic, like that of Amazon’s

-   Sustainability is fragmented. How can billions of people build
    closer relationships with sustainability-focused companies based on
    honesty and transparency? A research project for designing a
    sustainable shopping, savings, and investing companion.

-   Most sustainability plans rely on carbon credits to achieve their
    goals, making carbon credits a single point of failure. If the
    credits are not accurate, the whole system collapses.

-   TODO: Make a table showing research results translated to design
    decisions

-   Your Green Helper

-   Make some initial prototype? make YoutTbe video… hi, you have
    reached? spread… through ESTBan and others?

-   Currently CO<sub>2</sub> footprint calculators ask you a couple of
    questions and give a ballpark estimate. Does it make sense to track
    sustainability on a more nuanced level, like Apple Health, in order
    to encourage sustainable behavior?

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[0] }} />

-   *Affinity diagrams* help users organize ideas by brainstorming,
    sorting and labeling to cluster related information (Kara Pernice,
    2018; Quignard, 2022)
-   Scan a product to see the company and start investing or divesting
    from them Current economics is lowering the quality of life on the
    planet

Actionable Insights: Translate data into everyday actions the app can
suggest.

-   What does investing look like at the scale of billions of people?
    like IG
-   The most effective things are Commodities? Food, transport, fashion,
    plant trees.
-   personalized AI, meta glasses understand your context. sense and

    devices will learn and adapt to you as you use them.
-   Scalable Climate Solutions: What really works on a large scale?
-   brand colors: pink, orange, green

## Shopping-as-Investing

-   Introduce this concept

-   The Manor (2022)

-   Sustainability is hard. Green Filter helps you find companies that
    are making a true effort and build closer relationships through
    shopping, savings, and investing. Green Filter helps you find
    companies that are making a true effort to become sustainable and
    build closer relationships through shopping, savings, and investing

-   Gather requirements and build a prototype for the next-generation
    investment app for young adults. Improving the user experience for
    young adults getting started with (green) investing. What would a
    “Tinder for (Green) Investments” look like? How can we make the
    logistics of investing so easy to use and take into account my
    values?

-   My thesis core message is : everyone should change from consumer to
    sustainability investor (define these terms in the thesis). how to
    do this? can help you become from consumer to investor i believe
    there’s space for a product like that. your green investing friend
    find the companies tackling certain problems and invest in them
    using crypto business can be a force for good

-   Consumer purchases are an indicator of demand. If demand trends
    down, companies will stop producing this product.

## ‘Investment-as-Product’

-   Green Filter helps you discover how to save money and the planet
    with your daily shopping. By providing an easy way for people to
    learn about and shop with sustainable companies, we imagine a world
    where people invest in their future, find great deals on
    responsibly-made products, and get useful discounts from socially
    responsible brands.

-   GreenFilter is a product that combines AI, design and marketing to
    help people manage their social impact throughout the stages of
    their lives, from young adult years to retirement. Its primary goal
    is to give people the tools they need to invest responsibly in
    sustainable companies, while also educating them on this topic. Our
    project offers a responsive website and mobile app that leverages AI
    and other advanced technologies. In addition, our prototype includes
    a reality-based virtual assistant with voice command capabilities
    which can provide customers with new insights into the world of
    green finance

-   GreenFilter introduces a novel, interactive point-of-sale technology
    that helps people make greener shopping decisions. The platform uses
    artificial intelligence to suggest green alternatives for products
    on your shopping list, and will also help you to find other
    companies that can make sustainable versions of the product you are
    buying.

-   As people become aware of the impact their shopping is having on the
    environment, they become interested in finding alternatives to big
    brands and large companies. GreenFilter provides designers an AI
    companion design which helps people build relationships with
    sustainability-focused companies by providing personalized
    recommendations, giving product reviews and helping them shop
    sustainably. This new tool will empower consumers to make greener
    choices throughout their lives.

-   Better management of planet Earth

-   How can wee Shop, Save, Invest in line ecologic principles and
    planetary boundaries? individual action doesn’t move the needle. how
    to group together

-   App to build community

-   Life within planetary boundaries

-   Currently it seems there’s a secret around how things are produced
    we want to increase transparency

-   Companies that have nothing new nothing to hide should welcome this
    opportunity to mark themselves to keep a conscious consumers and
    investors.

-   We want to create competition around sustainable practices enter
    widespread adoption

-   Cigarettes and pictures of lung cancer every product should be
    required to have photos of production conditions switch such as
    Rainforest and deforestation the products that include Palm oil.

-   My thesis is that a lot of people want to do good, shop
    eco-friendly, invest green, etc. But they don’t believe the
    solutions work. They don’t have trust. This is a user interface
    issue. How to build trust.
