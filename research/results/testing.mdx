## Interview Template

This is the basic interview script, which was used with small
modifications at each interview.

On Momo:

-   What is a brand that you like’d or would like to buy - search -
    please pick a product (or search again)
-   After reaching Momo product page: what do you notice on this page?
-   What kind of information is important for you on this page?
-   Do you notice anything else?
-   (If the user doesn’t notice the green filter, direct their attention
    to it and ask: what do you think this does?)
-   Would you click on it - if the user says yes, continue - if the user
    says no, make note and continue
-   As the extension generates a response: what do you think about this
    content?
-   Is there any information that you consider important?
-   Anything else you see that you think looks special
-   Do you see anywhere you can click?
-   Would you click on it? - if yes, continue - if no, make note, and
    continue.
-   Explain: due to the limitation of the prototype, the test will
    continue on a separate page where you can ask questions.
-   Is there anything you would like to ask the helper?
-   Notice if the user picks from sample questions
-   Remind the user they can come up with their own question
-   As the AI is generating content ask: do you see any information in
    this content
-   Did you know this before or is there any info you didn’t know
    before? Make a note.
-   Front page: explain the helper takes into account your personal info
    and goals.
-   Ask: what kind of information do you think important to share with
    the helper?

## 2nd Wave of Testing (Fall 2024 - Spring 2025) - Prototype {#nd-wave-of-testing-fall-2024---spring-2025---prototype}

Interviews and testing survey were conducted anonymously in hopes to
have more honest responses from the responders.

-   32 anonymous Gen-Z participants in face-to-face interviews at 7
    universities
-   Over 100 anonymous self-testing participants at over 20 universities
-   Testing is anonymous

Below you can see some of the images testers uploaded from their own
devices (there were too many to be displayed here fully).

### Testing Summary

In-person interviews highlighted that participants generally appreciated
the transparency provided by the Green Filter app regarding
sustainability of products. Interviewees mentioned that the visibility
of *“Material Sustainability”* and the historical and environmental
impact of products influenced their perception and purchasing
intentions, sometimes causing them to reconsider previously unquestioned
consumption habits. Participants were particularly intrigued by the
comprehensive information on carbon emissions, labor issues, and
potential health risks from certain ingredients, emphasizing that such
details were rarely accessible in typical shopping experiences.
Additionally, participants valued AI-generated comparative data that
offered alternative sustainable brands and products, which helped them
better understand environmental impacts and make more informed choices.

However, usability issues surfaced regarding terminology and interface
clarity. Some users misunderstood the labeling related to financial
savings and carbon emission reductions, indicating the importance of
precise and intuitive wording in Chinese.

### Known Issues

-   The Green Filter (Ziran) Chrome Extension is unable to record
    activity due to browser security restrictions for plugins.
-   Meanwhile, the web-only version at “ai.ziran.tw” (without direct
    access to user’s screen), can record user activity.

### Notable Quotes from Self-Testing (Survey)

Apart from the in-person testing, there were also over 100 college
students who tested the Green Filter app on their own and reported their
ideas in a survey. Here’ are some excerpts.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[5] }} />

### Example Interview: 25 December 2024

Location: Taichung, National Chung Hsing University (NCHU) Anonymous
Tester Code: \[3G1RL\]

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[6] }} />

## 1st Wave of Testing (Spring 2024) - Prototype {#st-wave-of-testing-spring-2024---prototype}

Semi-structured interviews were conducted in Chinese. The interviewer
(me) took notes of the interviews. Some gaps in the data exist due to
the limited chinese language skills of the interviewer (me).

Note: There’s dropoff on evey step of the user journey. Note 2: Add
carbon indicators, other labels to the analysis, add report code,
calculate report code from URL? Save as KV. Note 3: Make use of the
Chinese term: 有意識的消費主義

RQ: To what extend can shopping become and entry point for saving and
investing. RQ: Can shopping serve as an entry point for sustainable
saving and investing?

Looked for Sony camera lens

#### May 1

Notes: *Professor Feedback*: 1st of May Prof. suggestion - make
connection between biodiversity and production and consumption clearer -
what is the incentive for companies to share their data?

my own idea: like the switch of going from traditional banking with ATM
machines on the street (or even the physical bank office) to online
banking with mobile payments.

Hypothesis: ESG accessibility can push companies to increase production
standards.

What if you can see ESG in near-realtime such as the stock market price?

I can imagine ESG derivative product like siemens gamesa

AI can help integrate esg derivatives into daily life to drive esg
adoption

“effective altruism (EA)”

“Blockchain technology can improve price transparency in product
distribution by allowing consumers to know the exact pricing from raw
materials to distributors to suppliers.”
