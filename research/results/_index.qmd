It is famously difficult to convince humans of anything. For that reason, to have any chance to impact human behaviour towards sustainability, the nudges should be delivered in-context, and at the right time.

For high ESG, Governance, Board Diversity, Board Experts on Climate, and Fintech Adoption (Digitalisation) matter. These are the main predictors of high ESG performance and should be highlighted to the users who wish to buy sustainable products.



Survey Overview

A survey of Taiwanese college students excludes overseas Chinese-speaking students as well as foreign students, covering attitudes towards shopping, saving, investing, economy, nature, sustainability, and AI.

Survey open from October 13th 2023 to May 31 2025

3000 cards with a QR code printed out

Distribution conducted at 21 universities handing out the cards

1289 people started the survey 518 quit

771 people completed the whole survey

Data after filtering 675 people aged 18-26 GenZ Taiwanese current students in BA large majority MA small minority or PhD level very few respondents

-  36 likert fields 5point scale used for clustering the students into 3 personas with Kmeans clustering

-  14 product features multiplechoice used for Kmodes clustering

-  4 choice experiments

-  2 option ranking questions

-  10 text fields used to enrich the personas


## Data Analysis

KMeans clustering for survey data Kmeans clustering is similar to vector distances for similarity used in largelanguage models LLMs word embeddings and deep learning


   Findings

   Literature AI assistants should integrate with Digital Product Passports
   Literature AI assistants should show carbon label data
   Literature AI assistants should avoid taking ESG at face value because its a really low bar and integrate other metrics such as B Corp
   Literature AI assistants should
   Literature Do not make another investing app make a sustainability filter for excising investing platforms
   Literature College students can support extended producer responsibility

How might AI assistants empower regenerative shopping saving and investing

Display the ESG EPR BCorp etc etc credentials for each product and investment EPR and BCorp are success stories which should be highlighted while ESG is largely discredited There are many existing and ongoing approaches to sustainability The best approach might be to plug into excising system and communities and legislation to support and empower them

How might one design an intuitive sustainable shopping saving investing app

   Apple Watch app

What app features might college students rate as the highest priority

   Autopilot

How might one visualize ecological impact in digital product design

   Accuracy is more important for human trust than actual impact

95,9% used a mobile device, 75,5% using an iOS device iPhone, 20,8% using an Android device design implication should design mobile app but apple is so restrictive

RQ 1

   the AI companion is informed by the latest scientific insights and can provide accurate evidencebased recommendations 
   The AI is designed to offer personalized guidance by analyzing complex environmental data and translating it into userfriendly information helping students make more sustainable choices in their daily lives 
   It explores various AI interaction designs including chatbots voice assistants and virtual avatars to find the most engaging and supportive formats for college students 
   address the attitudebehavior gap among college students by providing tools that make sustainable financial actions more convenient and impactful 

RQ 2

   provide realtime information about the sustainability of products and companie
   AI companion includes features for identifying and investing in sustainable companies This involves providing data on companies environmental social and governance ESG practices and facilitating investments in green bonds and sustainable funds 
   shoppingasinvesting where the AI links the act of purchasing sustainable products with investing in companies that produce these products effectively merging consumer and investor roles

## What is Research?

I, as the researcher, am similar to the blind people in the elephant story; focusing on greening shopping, saving, and investing are only the trunk of the enormous elephant that is environmental disaster unfolding in front of our eyes.

## GreenFilter Sustainability Index (GFSI)

The GFSI is an index resulting from my thesis research; an attempt to combine the underlying cross-disciplinary findings into a usable tool to make better healh and sustainability decisions when managing one's money.

The Goals of the Index:
*  Provide a single, composite score that reflects both personal health and environmental impact.
*  Encourage users to make actionable financial, consumption, and lifestyle choices that benefit planetary health (e.g., reducing CO₂eq emissions, preserving biodiversity) while also supporting individual well-being (e.g., pollution exposure, physical activity).
*  Leverage digital data sources—digital product passports (ESPR), open ESG data, wearable sensors, and personal financial accounts—through an AI companion (generative UI) to compute, visualize, and recommend improvements.
