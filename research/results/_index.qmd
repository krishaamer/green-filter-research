It is famously difficult to convince humans of anything. For that reason, to have any chance to impact human behaviour towards sustainability, the nudges should be delivered in-context, and at the right time.

For high ESG, Governance, Board Diversity, Board Experts on Climate, and Fintech Adoption (Digitalisation) matter. These are the main predictors of high ESG performance and should be highlighted to the users who wish to buy sustainable products.

The research helps me (and others) to

Avoid reinventing the wheel and duplicating existing approaches.

It aims to help app developers maximize impact by aiding complementary additionality.

Make high-quality products. If used wisely, money can help build communities of sustainable impact.

Define every word in the title: "The Journey from Consumer to Investor: Designing a Financial AI Companion for Young Adults to Help with Sustainable Shopping, Savings, and Investing"

Journey - behavioral change takes time

Consumer - purchase goods without thinking about the effect

Investor - thinking about the return

Design - decisions

Financial - dealing with money

AI Companion - automated sidekick

Young Adults - College Students

Help - to be of assistance

Sustainable Shopping - shopping understanding the consequences

Sustainable Saving - in this context I mean Sustainable Savings, that is reducing one's environmental footprint

Sustainable Investing - activity of thinking longer-term

### Survey Overview

A survey of Taiwanese college students excludes overseas Chinese-speaking students as well as foreign students, covering attitudes towards shopping, saving, investing, economy, nature, sustainability, and AI.

Survey open from October 13th 2023 to May 31 2025

3000 cards with a QR code printed out

Distribution conducted at 21 universities handing out the cards

1289 people started the survey 518 quit

771 people completed the whole survey

Data after filtering 675 people aged 18-26 GenZ Taiwanese current students in BA large majority MA small minority or PhD level very few respondents

-  36 likert fields 5point scale used for clustering the students into 3 personas with Kmeans clustering

-  14 product features multiplechoice used for Kmodes clustering

-  4 choice experiments

-  2 option ranking questions

-  10 text fields used to enrich the personas


## Data Analysis

KMeans clustering for survey data is similar to vector distances for similarity used in large language models (LLMs), word embeddings, and deep learning.


   Findings

   Literature AI assistants should integrate with Digital Product Passports
   Literature AI assistants should show carbon label data
   Literature AI assistants should avoid taking ESG at face value because its a really low bar and integrate other metrics such as B Corp
   Literature AI assistants should
   Literature Do not make another investing app make a sustainability filter for excising investing platforms
   Literature College students can support extended producer responsibility

How might AI assistants empower regenerative shopping saving and investing

Display the ESG EPR BCorp etc etc credentials for each product and investment EPR and BCorp are success stories which should be highlighted while ESG is largely discredited There are many existing and ongoing approaches to sustainability The best approach might be to plug into excising system and communities and legislation to support and empower them

How might one design an intuitive sustainable shopping saving investing app

   Apple Watch app

What app features might college students rate as the highest priority

   Autopilot

How might one visualize ecological impact in digital product design

   Accuracy is more important for human trust than actual impact

95,9% used a mobile device, 75,5% using an iOS device iPhone, 20,8% using an Android device design implication should design mobile app but apple is so restrictive

RQ 1

   The AI companion is informed by the latest scientific insights and can provide accurate evidence-based recommendations 
   The AI is designed to offer personalized guidance by analyzing complex environmental data and translating it into user-friendly information helping students make more sustainable choices in their daily lives.
   It explores various AI interaction designs including chatbots,voice assistants and virtual avatars to find the most engaging and supportive formats for college students.
   Address the attitude-behavior gap among college students by providing tools that make sustainable financial actions more convenient and impactful.

RQ 2

   provide realtime information about the sustainability of products and companie
   AI companion includes features for identifying and investing in sustainable companies This involves providing data on companies environmental social and governance ESG practices and facilitating investments in green bonds and sustainable funds 
   shoppingasinvesting where the AI links the act of purchasing sustainable products with investing in companies that produce these products effectively merging consumer and investor roles

## What is Research?
I, as the researcher, am similar to the blind people in the elephant story; focusing on greening shopping, saving, and investing are only the trunk of the enormous elephant that is environmental disaster unfolding in front of our eyes.

### Quotes from the Survey

Even though most of the survey questions were numeric, the respondents did have the opportunity to write more in open-ended questions. Here are some selected quotes:

> "I worry whether info from AI is trustworthy, whether politics or business bend it, and whether my own data steers the algorithm and reshapes what I see.", anonymous student at National Taiwan University

> "Right now I care most about how carbon emissions could raise future costs for companies, so when I invest I look at whether their carbon liabilities outweigh their carbon assets.", anonymous student at Taichung Feng Chia University

> "People will only focus on sustainability if they can afford to. When a family’s budget is tight, putting food on the table beats caring about the planet." anonymous student at Tainan National Cheng Kung University.

> "When we were kids, Dad made us bring a shopping bag and reuse it. Even if it got dirty, we could turn it into a trash bag.", anonymous student at Taoyuan Ming Chuan University.

> “Take our school as an example. We boast about being the top green university in the country and we run plenty of green research projects, yet students’ eco-awareness has not really improved. Even with constant green messaging, the cafeterias are still flooded with ‘eco’ chopsticks and plastic spoons.”, anonymous student at National Pingtung University of Science and Technology (NPUST)

> “Every purchase is a vote for our own future. College students can keep choosing green brands and changing their habits. Paying attention to these issues puts pressure on companies and pushes them toward cleaner production.”, anonymous student at Fu Jen Catholic University (FJU)

> “AI can handle the time-consuming math and analysis, but I can only use it effectively if I have baseline knowledge of what I am asking.”, anonymous student at National Taiwan University (NTU)

> “If eco-friendly products use fewer materials, they ought to be cheaper. No one should strong-arm me into buying something expensive.”,
anonymous student at National Chung Hsing University (NCHU)

> “Probably eco-education. Taiwan’s education system is lousy in many ways, yet the part that builds environmental awareness in students is actually useful.”, anonymous student at Fu Jen Catholic University (FJU)

> “Let’s talk about why people want sustainability, what benefits it brings to the environment, how we can see the results, and how much worse things get if we ignore it.”, anonymous student at Chang Gung University (CGU)

> “Your survey is interesting, but in my opinion most Taiwanese citizens will find it hard to fill out. There are specialised terms without explanations. Otherwise it is great. A few typos could be fixed, but you are a foreigner, you are already doing awesome.”, anonymous student at National Dong Hwa University (NDHU)

> “You could ask Taiwanese friends to review the survey’s wording. Keep going. Thank you for your bright smile, a smile can advance sustainability. I believe in the power of the spirit.”, anonymous student at National Tsing Hua University (NTHU)

There are many, the above is a sample of the responses.
