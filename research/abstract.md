# Abstract

## *The Journey from Consumer to Investor: Designing a Financial AI Companion for Young Adults to Help with Sustainable Shopping, Savings, and Investing*

How can people shop, save & invest sustainably? Ellen MacArthur Foundation's models show 45% of CO2e emissions come from our daily shopping, produced by companies that make the products we consume ([@CompletingPictureHow]). 


In the U.S. alone, the combined annual consumer spending of Millennials and Gen-Z was over $2.5T USD in 2020 (see @MillennialsGenTeens). 

Over the coming decade, in the U.S., UK, and Australia, Millennials are inheriting $30T USD from their parents ([@calastoneMillennialsInvestingDetailed2020]). 

Where does our money go and what are some greener alternatives? 

The study presents an AI companion design which seeks to help people build relationships with sustainability-focused companies. The major contribution of this study is an interactive artefact (a prototype) informed by design research.

This is largely due to the production and manufacturing processes of the companies that make the products we consume on a daily basis.


As people become aware of the impact their shopping is having on the environment, they become interested in finding alternatives to big brands and large companies. GreenFilter provides designers an AI companion design which helps people build relationships with sustainability-focused companies by providing personalized recommendations, giving product reviews and helping them shop sustainably. This new tool will empower consumers to make greener choices throughout their lives.

An AI companion app that seeks to help people build relationships with sustainability-focused companies and enables people to be more transparent and responsible in their consumption behavior.

GreenFilter introduces a novel, interactive point-of-sale technology that helps people make greener shopping decisions. The platform uses artificial intelligence to suggest green alternatives for products on your shopping list, and will also help you to find other companies that can make sustainable versions of the product you are buying.

Green Filter helps you discover how to save money and the planet with your daily shopping. By providing an easy way for people to learn about and shop with sustainable companies, we imagine a world where people invest in their future, find great deals on responsibly-made products, and get useful discounts from socially responsible brands.

GreenFilter is a product that combines AI, design and marketing to help people manage their social impact throughout the stages of their lives, from young adult years to retirement. Its primary goal is to give people the tools they need to invest responsibly in sustainable companies, while also educating them on this topic. Our project offers a responsive website and mobile app that leverages AI and other advanced technologies. In addition, our prototype includes a reality-based virtual assistant with voice command capabilities which can provide customers with new insights into the world of green finance
