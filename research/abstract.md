## *Designing an AI Companion to Help College Students Shop, Save, and Invest Sustainably* {#designing-an-ai-companion-to-help-college-students-shop-save-and-invest-sustainably}

Overconsumption-driven extractive business practices are a large contributor to the degradation of Earth’s natural ecosystems, resource depletion, climate crisis, pollution of water, air, and soil, deforestation, diminishing biodiversity, and many other environmental problems.

For the individual person, it’s difficult to know what’s sustainable. Even for highly motivated people, taking sustainable financial actions requires extensive time for research. Sustainability-focused companies exist but it’s difficult to find and transact with them in the midst of widespread greenwashing. People lack tools to build communities of sustainable impact.

In this thesis I present an AI-assistant called “green filter” to empower regenerative financial activism and adopt the donut economy as my overarching theoretical framework. All interactions with businesses from shopping to saving and investing can be seen through the filter of sustainability. I propose *interfaces* and *workflows*, specifically **DonutBird**, to help people develop long-term relationships with sustainability-focused companies that acknowledge ecological limits.

The major contribution of the study is an interactive artefact - a design prototype of an AI companion, informed by design research.
