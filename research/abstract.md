## *The Journey from Consumer to Investor: Designing a Financial AI Companion for Young Adults to Help with Sustainable Shopping, Saving, and Investing* {#the-journey-from-consumer-to-investor-designing-a-financial-ai-companion-for-young-adults-to-help-with-sustainable-shopping-saving-and-investing}

Financial decisions including shopping, saving and investing have an effect on sustainably yet it’s difficult to filter ‘green’ from the polluting. The study presents a speculative design of an AI companion which seeks to help build long-term relationships with sustainability-focused companies. Furthermore, the study introduces the concept of ‘shopping-as-investing’. The major contribution of the study is an interactive artefact (a prototype) informed by design research.
