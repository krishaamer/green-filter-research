## *The Journey from Consumer to Investor: Designing a Financial AI Companion for Young Adults to Help with Sustainable Shopping, Saving, and Investing* {#the-journey-from-consumer-to-investor-designing-a-financial-ai-companion-for-young-adults-to-help-with-sustainable-shopping-saving-and-investing}

Financial decisions — shopping, saving and investing — define a person’s ecological footprint however quickly filtering ‘green’ from ‘polluting’ in daily life is complicated even for highly motivated people. Moreover, because one person’s personal impact is negligible, groups of people collaborating in changing their habits have a higher potential to decrease their footprint. This study presents a speculative design for an AI companion which aims to simplify building long-term relationships with sustainability-focused companies. Furthermore, the study introduces the concept of ‘shopping-as-investing’. The major contribution of the study is an interactive artefact (a prototype) informed by design research.
