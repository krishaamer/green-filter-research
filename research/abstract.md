## *Designing a Sustainability-Focused AI Assistant to Help College Students Shop, Save, and Invest* {#designing-a-sustainability-focused-ai-assistant-to-help-college-students-shop-save-and-invest}

For the individual college student, it’s difficult to know what’s sustainable. Even for highly motivated people, taking sustainable financial action requires extensive time for research. Sustainability-focused companies exist but it’s time-consuming to find them in the midst of widespread greenwashing. This cross-disciplinary research focuses on the potential of using AI assistants to improve the way we shop, save, and invest, sustainably.

College student are the future of every industry. In particular, I survey Taiwanese college students’ attitudes towards sustainability, money, and AI. I use data-driven interaction design to build transparency into opaque systems in order to enable college students participate in sustainable financial activism.

in order to help students’ align convenience with sustainability.

Finally, I present a prototype AI-assistant called “green filter” and propose *interfaces* and *workflows* to see financial interactions through the filter of sustainability. The major contribution of the study is an interactive artefact: a design prototype informed by design research.
