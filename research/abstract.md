## *Designing a Sustainability-Focused AI Assistant to Help College Students Shop, Save, and Invest* {#designing-a-sustainability-focused-ai-assistant-to-help-college-students-shop-save-and-invest}

For the individual college student, it’s difficult to know what’s sustainable. Even for highly motivated people, taking sustainable financial actions requires extensive time for research. Sustainability-focused companies exist but it’s time-consuming to find and interact with them in the midst of widespread greenwashing. People lack trustworthy tools to buy, save, and invest.

This cross-disciplinary research focuses on the intersection of AI assistants and sustainability. I use data-driven interaction design to build transparency into opaque systems in order to enable college students to turn their environmetal politics into financial activism.

I present an AI-assistant called “green filter” and propose *interfaces* and *workflows* to see financial interactions through the filter of sustainability. If used wisely, money can help build communities of sustainable impact.

The major contribution of the study is an interactive artefact: a design prototype informed by design research.
