## *Designing a Green Filter to Help College Students Shop, Save, and Invest Sustainably* {#designing-a-green-filter-to-help-college-students-shop-save-and-invest-sustainably}

Overconsumption-driven extractive business practices contribute to the degradation of Earth’s natural ecosystems, pollution of water, air, and soil, deforestation, diminishing biodiversity, climate instability, extreme weather, modern slavery, worsening human health, and other environmental and social challenges.

For the individual person, it’s difficult to know what’s sustainable. Even for highly motivated people, taking sustainable financial actions requires extensive time for research. Sustainability-focused companies exist but it’s time-consuming to find them in the midst of widespread greenwashing. People lack trustworthy tools to buy, save, and invest.

In this thesis I present an AI-assistant called “green filter” to empower regenerative financial activism. All financial interactions with businesses can be seen through the filter of sustainability. I propose *interfaces* and *workflows* to help people develop long-term relationships with regenerative companies that acknowledge ecological limits and make high-quality products. If used wisely, money can help build communities of sustainable impact.

The major contribution of the study is an interactive artefact: a design prototype informed by design research.
