# Discussion

How can finance enable/help/encourage sustainability? Personalized
Investing

An open question is whether young investors are more easily than
professionals swayed by influencers?

, Can the democratization of various uses of money include
sustainability as a feature?

For consumer activism to become mainstream it needs to much simpler.
Consumers do have increasing power to use their money to reinforces
certain types of businesses; as conscious consumers we can vote with our
dollars. How can we do it？ Sustainable brands, ESG, etc, etc. Pushing
highers Standards and choose companies that adopt circular design” What
is the consumer CO<sub>2</sub> contribution? What is the target? Consume
pressure to advance ESG regulatory standards to add a baseline ESG
dynamic pricing of risk like climate, mandatory climate disclosures,
carbon pricing knowing your supply chain, analyze supply chain risk.

-   Product-level reporting can be a basis for investing in companies.
    “Product-investing”. I want to invest in particular products.

Overconsumption and underinvestment. -, includes financial products
creating pathways towards sustainability-focused investing.

**Important: “creating sustainability trust in companies in realtime”**

My home country Estonia at the time was considered low-income, a small
nation in poverty behind the *Iron Curtain* occupation of the Soviet
Union; we now in 2024, have also reached high-income status.

Memes and AI assistant can be a tool for empowerment. I would like to
have an AI agent to set my requirements and preferences and give a
“f\*\*\* you” middle finger to companies that don’t meet them. I could
also give a thumbs up to companies that meet my expectations. Perhaps
the user interface could like Tinder where I can swipe left and right.

How can AI interfaces enable/help/encourage sustainability? AI-fying
User Interfaces (for Sustainability)

Trend of sustainably, how can sustainability become more accessible?
People want to shop, save, and invest sustainably - how to do it?

Sustainable capital allocation methods are many. The extent to which
this funnel works - and it’s indeed a complex, multi–step funnel -
depends on curbing greenwashing to a level that allows consumers to
distinguish eco–friendly businesses from the heavy polluters.

ESG reports are very general and opaque. We need product-level analytics
and reporting to be able to compare products.. ESG is filled with
greenwashing. ESG is a really low bad. metrics and goals: ESG, SDGs, ESG
risk. Q: Reflection on the ESG wave: Does a company that performs well
in carbon reduction but whose products are harmful to health conform to
the spirit of ESG? Sest ei saa ESG ja teisi mõõdikuid usaldada,
crowdsourced mõõdikud.

My thesis centers on embedding transparency into every stage of a
product’s life–cycle, from raw‐material sourcing through purchase to
end‐of‐life recycling, so that young adults can make truly informed,
sustainability-driven financial decisions.

Investing is a fundamentally hopeful act. It means I think there’s a
future. Specifically, ‘green investing’ is investing in the future of
our planet - but can we trust the sustainability practices the ‘green’
investment vehicles aggregate, promising to have a positive impact? For
example, the European Union for many years counted biomass as ‘green’
energy, even while forestry companies were cutting down trees to produce
the biomass - the regulation was not specific enough to curb this
practice. So, in effect, a ‘green investor’ might be supporting
deforestation. How can an easy-to-use investment app address such
complexities without alienating the users?

Copy-investing is a popular feature of retail investing platforms like
EToro

For young people, investing mostly means buying cryptocurrencies?

It can be as mundane as choosing the next eco-friendly product instead
of the polluting one we purchase in the supermarket make a difference?
How to invest in the growth of companies that put ESG at the center of
their activities instead of using it for greenwashing? Creating direct
ties will improve ESG. A journey from consumption to investing, in line
with users’ personal values, by providing relevant sustainable finance
guidance.

Consumption is ruining the world the world thinking as an investor the
investor mindset. But there’s so much capital in large funds retails
investor money doesn’t matter at all. does retail money make any
difference? Retail Investor Helpers: A wide number of banks are offering
services marketed a sustainable. It’s hard to decide. Gamestop for
climate massively collaborative investing by gen-z?

Analysis: Messari: investor education, information asymmetry.The
Information evavõrdsus disparity between pro and novice investors
creates a big gap in knowledge.

### Sustainability

*Design Implications from the Sustainability chapter*

Start with the most polluted regions as priority?

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[3] }} />

### AI

This chapter looked at AI in general since its early history and then
focused on AI assistants in particular.

***Design Implications:*** AI companions could combine sensor data from
human bodies with the ability to reason about human speech, to provide
increasingly relevant, in-context assistance. Because of the
conversational nature of LLMs, they are very useful for affective
computing.

Anthropomorphism: ***Design Implications:*** This suggests adding an
avatar to the AI design may be worthwhile.

## What is Research?

I, as the researcher, am similar to the blind people in the elephant
story; focusing on greening shopping, saving, and investing are only the
trunk of the enormous elephant that is environmental disaster unfolding
in front of our eyes.

online/offline ethnographic participant observation At this stage in the
research, the central concept being studied is defined generally as user
expectations for a sustainable investment app.

What are my hypotheses?

User experiments

Financial statistics

Analyzing existing apps and user pain-points

List of topics gleaned from literature review for discussion with the
experts:

Transparency and sources of ESG and similar data

I will test the prototype with potential users using an online choice
experiment survey.

Research Process In terms of literature review, academic inquiry in
social sciences largely follows phenomena, while the issues and
technologies discussed here are emergent. Not many studies exist yet
(they might in a few years), which is why some of my references are to
company press releases and news stories, or for public companies, their
advisory for investors.

Target potential retail investors aged in generation-z 20-29, all gender
in Taiwan. In general, the Taiwanese culture is savings oriented: I’m in
a good location for financial user experience research.

Set your target goals

Access to health care

Access to education

Climate action

I propose *interfaces* and *workflows* to see financial interactions
through the filter of sustainability.

What kind of sustainability info do college students care about? How
would college students prefer to interact with the AI? What role would
college students prefer the AI to take? How can college students trust
AI? What can college students do to aid sustainability efforts? How
might AI assistants help college students find shopping, saving, and
investing opportunities?

How can design enable/help/encourage sustainability?

also known as circular economy. Assuming that as individuals we want to
act in a sustainable way, how exactly would be go about doing that?

…for Sustainable Products

*Results: Open data is needed for civic engagement. Sharing vs privacy
is a political question. Privacy and data-sharing are not in opposition.
Sustainability needs to be balanced with privacy.*

Societal movements change things: implication for design: build a
community

Growing public understanding of how nature works and intersects with our
use of money to buy products, creates interest in understanding “where
does stuff come from”. Sustainable supply chains.

“Systemic change through financial actions driving policy and market
changes encourage broader industry shifts towards greener practices”.

Overconsumption-driven extractive business practices contribute to the
degradation of Earth’s natural ecosystems, pollution of water, air, and
soil, deforestation, diminishing biodiversity, climate instability,
extreme weather, modern slavery, worsening human health, and other
environmental and social challenges (ADD CITATION). Companies are
attuned to consumer demand however widespread greenwashing makes it
tiring to find sustainability-focused companies and requires extensive
time for research. Even for highly motivated people, it’s difficult to
know what’s sustainable.

My interest lies in understanding how AI assistants can help conscious
consumers become sustainable investors. The purpose of this study is to
explore how to provide the best user experience to potential sustainable
financial AI companion users. In their sustainability report every
company looks perfect. How can people shop, save and invest sustainably?
Where does our money go and what are some greener alternatives? The
companion enables people to be more transparent and responsible in their
consumption behavior.

In Taiwan water is too polluted can’t swim

air is too dirty can’t breather (show my own stats)

show local pollution map?

show factories on the map

instead of the browser pluging just make a website where you can share
the link of the product (and cache rhe results)

on ios can use the share screen to share to the app?

ICID calls upon us to have the courage to redesign entire industries

This research takes place at the intersection of Taiwanese college
students, sustainability, finance, AI, and design.

For the average person like myself, my experience with money is mostly
limited to buying things at the supermarket. Food, clothes, furniture,
soap, mobile phone. This leaves very few options on how to start with
something new like saving and investing.

Could the Green Supermarket become the entry point to Green Savings and
Green Investing?

Oboarding more people for sustainable practices is a complex interaction
design issue hindered by ambiguous data (what is sustainable?) and messy
human motivations (we love buying things).

What can people who want to preserve Earth’s environment, exactly do?
How can networks of people come together?

— LLMs enable data journalists to create stories: Big Local News (2024)

Health tracking apps paired with connected devices such as Apple Watch
filled with sensors provide one model for simple interactions to
dynamically track digital health data - also known as a quantified self.
This data allows apps to provide tips how to improve health outcomes
through small daily actions such as climbing more stairs. Small
interactions allow users to align their goals with their actions.

What would be a good interface to track sustainability? What is the user
interface at scale, useful for billions of people?

One way to influence societal outcomes is to decide where to put our
money. While our financial decisions are a vote towards the type of
businesses we want to support, is it enough?

While some people are demanding sustainability, and some governments and
companies are announcing green investment opportunities, how can
consumers discover the most suitable investment options for their
situation?

How can retail investors access and differentiate between eco-friendly
sustainability-focused investable assets?

The level of knowledge of and exposure to investing varies widely
between countries and people.

Could linking green consumption patterns with sustainable investing
provide another pathway to speed up achieving climate justice as well as
personal financial goals?

In this simplified scenario, I’m in a physical offline store, doing some
shopping. When putting a bottle of Coca Cola in my basket, my AI
companion Susan will ask me a personalized question:

Does individual climate action help?

Gen-Z college students (target users) may not have the capital to make a
financial dent today however they can be early adopter and they will be
the decision-makers in a few years.

“Like climate change, the focus on individual actions as a solution is
often misplaced, though it remains a focus of media and industry. For
decades, the petrochemical industry has offloaded responsibility onto
individuals through promoting concepts such as the”carbon footprint”,
championed in a 2004 advertising campaign by British Petroleum” Lavers
et al. (2022).

Individual efforts are too small to matter unless they’re inspired by
Community a effort

## Google Chrome Extentsion

While Google is the most popular browser with 3 billion users,
extensions are a relatively less known feature of the browser. Most
popular extensions are Grammarly, for Taiwanese students End Note is
familiar.

However it’s only available for computers (extensions don’t run on
phones and tablets).

## Results

The research helps me (and others) to

Avoid reinventing the wheel and duplicating existing approaches.

It aims to help app developers maximize impact by aiding complementary
additionality.

Make high-quality products. If used wisely, money can help build
communities of sustainable impact.

Define every word in the title: “The Journey from Consumer to Investor:
Designing a Financial AI Companion for Young Adults to Help with
Sustainable Shopping, Savings, and Investing”

Journey - behavioral change takes time

Consumer - purchase goods without thinking about the effect

Investor - thinking about the return

Design - decisions

Financial - dealing with money

AI Companion - automated sidekick

Young Adults - College Students

Help - to be of assistance

Sustainable Shopping - shopping understanding the consequences

Sustainable Saving - in this context I mean Sustainable Savings, that is
reducing one’s environmental footprint

Sustainable Investing - activity of thinking longer-term

## Design Implications from the User Survey

### Group-Related Features

General theory about Taiwanese society suggests that it’s low-context
and people need groups to do activities. But my survey about my
sustainability app shows that people don’t pick the features for joining
groups. Joining groups was one of the least interesting choices in the
survey.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[6] }} />

Factorial Surveys (Li et al., 2022): “Factorial surveys is a research
method that combines classical experiments with survey methodologies.
Factorial surveys use short narratives, called vignettes, to represent
various levels of independent variables that are too complex or
unethical to create and manipulate in real-world or lab situations”

and a including a choice experiment between potential feature sets in
consumption, savings, and investment.

Start with a simple but powerful question: — Does it matter what you
buy? — Does it matter how much you save? — Does it matter where you
invest? Why?

## Research Limitations

First, finance is a highly regulated industry and the proposed user
experience designs may be limited by legal requirements. This study does
not take such limitations into account, rather focusing only on the user
experience.

This work is focused on user experience design and does attempt to make
a contribution to economics.

ESG data is expensive so couldn’t be used in this research. ESG needs
data to give us an accurate understanding of the realities inside
companies and the user experience design does not address the underlying
data quality problem further than by providing a link to the data
source.

I don’t have access to user financial data.

Research Reason: While many people are working on AI models, there’s a
lack of people working on “Human-AI interaction”. Sustainability is the
context. How can we better team up to solve the challenges we face this
century? The huge externalities.

## Future Research

The literature is rich and there is ample space for future research. The
following includes some suggestions for authors whose work deserves a
deeper look.

as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Mistral, and others?
