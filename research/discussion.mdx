# Discussion

I propose *interfaces* and *workflows* to see financial interactions
through the filter of sustainability.

What kind of sustainability info do college students care about? How
would college students prefer to interact with the AI? What role would
college students prefer the AI to take? How can college students trust
AI? What can college students do to aid sustainability efforts? How
might AI assistants help college students find shopping, saving, and
investing opportunities?

“Systemic change through financial actions driving policy and market
changes encourage broader industry shifts towards greener practices”.

Overconsumption-driven extractive business practices contribute to the
degradation of Earth’s natural ecosystems, pollution of water, air, and
soil, deforestation, diminishing biodiversity, climate instability,
extreme weather, modern slavery, worsening human health, and other
environmental and social challenges (cite). Companies are attuned to
consumer demand however widespread greenwashing makes it tiring to find
sustainability-focused companies and requires extensive time for
research. Even for highly motivated people, it’s difficult to know
what’s sustainable.

## Results

The research helps me (and others) to avoid reinventing the wheel and
duplicating existing approaches. It aims to help app developers maximize
impact by aiding complementary additionality.

and make high-quality products. If used wisely, money can help build
communities of sustainable impact.

#### Define Words

Define every word in the title: “The Journey from Consumer to Investor:
Designing a Financial AI Companion for Young Adults to Help with
Sustainable Shopping, Savings, and Investing”

-   Journey - behavioral change takes time
-   Consumer, purchase goods without thinking about the effect
-   Investor, thinking about the return
-   Design, decisions
-   Financial, dealing with money
-   AI Companion, automated sidekick
-   College Students
-   Help, be of assistance
-   Sustainable Shopping
-   Savings, in this context I mean Sustainable Savings, that is
    reducing one’s environmental footprint
-   Investing, activity of thinking longer-term

## Research Limitations

-   This work is focused on user experience design and does attempt to
    make a contribution to economics. Sacred Economics is use as-is as a
    framework and visualization tool.

-   First, finance is a highly regulated industry and the proposed user
    experience designs may be limited by legal requirements. This study
    does not take such limitations into account, rather focusing only on
    the user experience.

-   Finally, ESG needs data to give us an accurate understanding of the
    realities inside companies and the user experience design does not
    address the underlying data quality problem further than by
    providing a link to the data source.

-   Research Reason: While many people are working on AI models, there’s
    a lack of people working on “Human-AI interaction”. Sustainability
    is the context. How can we better team up to solve the challenges we
    face this century? The huge externalities.
