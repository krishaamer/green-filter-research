# Discussion

## Results

The research helps me (and others) to avoid reinventing the wheel and
duplicating existing approaches. It aims to help app developers maximize
impact by aiding complementary additionality.

and make high-quality products. If used wisely, money can help build
communities of sustainable impact.

#### Define Words

Define every word in the title: “The Journey from Consumer to Investor:
Designing a Financial AI Companion for Young Adults to Help with
Sustainable Shopping, Savings, and Investing”

-   Journey - behavioral change takes time
-   Consumer, purchase goods without thinking about the effect
-   Investor, thinking about the return
-   Design, decisions
-   Financial, dealing with money
-   AI Companion, automated sidekick
-   College Students
-   Help, be of assistance
-   Sustainable Shopping
-   Savings, in this context I mean Sustainable Savings, that is
    reducing one’s environmental footprint
-   Investing, activity of thinking longer-term

## Research Limitations

-   This work is focused on user experience design and does attempt to
    make a contribution to economics. Sacred Economics is use as-is as a
    framework and visualization tool.

-   First, finance is a highly regulated industry and the proposed user
    experience designs may be limited by legal requirements. This study
    does not take such limitations into account, rather focusing only on
    the user experience.

-   Finally, ESG needs data to give us an accurate understanding of the
    realities inside companies and the user experience design does not
    address the underlying data quality problem further than by
    providing a link to the data source.

-   Research Reason: While many people are working on AI models, there’s
    a lack of people working on “Human-AI interaction”. Sustainability
    is the context. How can we better team up to solve the challenges we
    face this century? The huge externalities.
