# Discussion

## Design Implications

The following findings from *Literature Review,* *User Survey*, and
*Prototype Testing*, have been categorized by chapter and list some of
the key implications which can lead to *Feature Ideas*.

### College

College students need tools for action. General theory about Taiwanese
society suggests that it’s low-context and people need groups to do
activities. But my survey about my sustainability app shows that people
don’t pick the features for joining groups. Joining groups was one of
the least interesting choices in the survey.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[0] }} />

Environment shapes action.. how to create an environment where college
students can influence companies.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[1] }} />

### Sustainability

Design implications arising from the sustainability chapter.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[2] }} />

### Design

This chapter has the following design implications.

Several superapps already contain features for payments (shopping),
savings, and investing. Yet none thus far integrate Digital Product
Passports to understand the products’ journey, including the origin and
manufacturing conditions, materials, components, CO<sub>2e</sub>
footprint and environmental impact, post-consumer repair, recycling, and
end-of-life disposal guidelines.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[3] }} />

### AI

This chapter looked at AI in general since its early history and then
focused on AI assistants in particular.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[4] }} />

### Finance

Design implications results from the literature review on finance.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[5] }} />

First, this work is focused on integrating sustainability into user
experience design and does attempt to make a contribution to economics,
finance, on any related technical field - in the context of this work,
these fields are sources of inspiration for design.

Second, finance is a highly regulated industry and the proposed user
experience designs may be limited by legal requirements. This study does
not take such limitations into account, rather focusing only on the user
experience.

Third, up to date ESG data is expensive and thus couldn’t directly be
used in this research. ESG needs data to give us an accurate
understanding of the realities inside companies and the user experience
design does not address the underlying data quality problem further than
by providing a link to the data source.

Fourth, I don’t have access to users’ financial data, which would be
useful for design research.

## Future Research

Some ideas for fruitful research directions:

-   Perceptions of pollution levels among Taiwanese college students.

-   Does the specialized interface for AI offer any advantages of a
    general-purpose UIs such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Mistral, and
    others?

-   While many people are working on AI models, there’s a lack of people
    working on Human-AI interaction in the context of sustainability.

If you do decide to pursue any of these questions or were otherwise
inspired by my thesis, please do reach out. As I have interest in these
areas of research, I would happy to help in any way I can. Thank you.
