College Student Willingness to pay ( WTP)

Defining the Problem Space.

## Data Analysis

-   Use K-Means clustering for survey data
-

## Factorial Surveys

-   Li et al. (2022): “Factorial surveys is a research method that
    combines classical experiments with survey methodologies. Factorial
    surveys use short narratives, called vignettes, to represent various
    levels of independent variables that are too complex or unethical to
    create and manipulate in real-world or lab situations”

## What is Research?

-   Contact Kalle Lasn, Culture Jam

-   online/offline ethnographic participant observation At this stage in
    the research, the central concept being studied is defined generally
    as user expectations for a sustainable investment app.

-   What are my hypotheses?

-   User experiments

-   Financial statistics

-   Analyzing existing apps and user pain-points

-   List of topics gleaned from literature review for discussion with
    the experts:

-   Transparency and sources of ESG and similar data

-   I will test the prototype with potential users using an online
    choice experiment survey.

-   Research Process In terms of literature review, academic inquiry in
    social sciences largely follows phenomena, while the issues and
    technologies discussed here are emergent. Not many studies exist yet
    (they might in a few years), which is why some of my references are
    to company press releases and news stories, or for public companies,
    their advisory for investors.

-   Target potential retail investors aged 20-29, all genders, in
    countries with highly developed financial markets and active social
    campaigns demanding sustainability (Sweden). And Taiwan. In general,
    the Taiwanese culture is savings oriented: I’m in a good location
    for financial user experience research.

-   Set your target goals

-   Access to health care

-   Access to education

-   Climate action

I propose *interfaces* and *workflows* to see financial interactions
through the filter of sustainability.

What kind of sustainability info do college students care about? How
would college students prefer to interact with the AI? What role would
college students prefer the AI to take? How can college students trust
AI? What can college students do to aid sustainability efforts? How
might AI assistants help college students find shopping, saving, and
investing opportunities?

“Systemic change through financial actions driving policy and market
changes encourage broader industry shifts towards greener practices”.

Overconsumption-driven extractive business practices contribute to the
degradation of Earth’s natural ecosystems, pollution of water, air, and
soil, deforestation, diminishing biodiversity, climate instability,
extreme weather, modern slavery, worsening human health, and other
environmental and social challenges (ADD CITATION). Companies are
attuned to consumer demand however widespread greenwashing makes it
tiring to find sustainability-focused companies and requires extensive
time for research. Even for highly motivated people, it’s difficult to
know what’s sustainable.

My interest lies in understanding how AI assistants can help conscious
consumers become sustainable investors. The purpose of this study is to
explore how to provide the best user experience to potential sustainable
financial AI companion users. In their sustainability report every
company looks perfect. How can people shop, save and invest sustainably?
Where does our money go and what are some greener alternatives? The
companion enables people to be more transparent and responsible in their
consumption behavior.

in taiwan water is too pollutee can’t swim

air is too dirty can’t breather (show my own stats)

start local then go global with backup data from global sources

ask chatgpt how to organize my sections

rq: how to connect env destruction pollution to source causes

rq: how to connect everyday financial actions to environmental impact in
a visual/ meaningful way

idea came riding my bike in annan can’t swim in yhe annan river

show local pollution map?

show factories on the map

instead of the browser pluging just make a website where you can share
the link of the product (and cache rhe results)

on ios can use the share screen to share to the app?

ICID calls upon us to have the courage to redesign entire industries

This research takes place at the intersection of Taiwanese college
students, sustainability, finance, AI, and design.

For the average person like myself, my experience with money is mostly
limited to buying things at the supermarket. Food, clothes, furniture,
soap, mobile phone. This leaves very few options on how to start with
something new like saving and investing.

Could the Green Supermarket become the entry point to Green Savings and
Green Investing?

Oboarding more people for sustainable practices is a complex interaction
design issue hindered by ambiguous data (what is sustainable?) and messy
human motivations (we love buying things).

What can people who want to preserve Earth’s environment, exactly do?
How can networks of people come together?

Health tracking apps paired with connected devices such as Apple Watch
filled with sensors provide one model for simple interactions to
dynamically track digital health data - also known as a quantified self.
This data allows apps to provide tips how to improve health outcomes
through small daily actions such as climbing more stairs. Small
interactions allow users to align their goals with their actions.

What would be a good interface to track sustainability? What is the user
interface at scale, useful for billions of people?

One way to influence societal outcomes is to decide where to put our
money. While our financial decisions are a vote towards the type of
businesses we want to support, is it enough?

While some people are demanding sustainability, and some governments and
companies are announcing green investment opportunities, how can
consumers discover the most suitable investment options for their
situation?

How can retail investors access and differentiate between eco-friendly
sustainability-focused investable assets?

The level of knowledge of and exposure to investing varies widely
between countries and people.

Could linking green consumption patterns with sustainable investing
provide another pathway to speed up achieving climate justice as well as
personal financial goals?

In this simplified scenario, I’m in a physical offline store, doing some
shopping. When putting a bottle of Coca Cola in my basket, my AI
companion Susan will ask me a personalized question:

Does individual climate action help?

Gen-Z college students (target users) may not have the capital to make a
financial dent today however they can be early adopter and they will be
the decision-makers in a few years.

“Like climate change, the focus on individual actions as a solution is
often misplaced, though it remains a focus of media and industry. For
decades, the petrochemical industry has offloaded responsibility onto
individuals through promoting concepts such as the”carbon footprint”,
championed in a 2004 advertising campaign by British Petroleum” Lavers,
Bond and Rolsky (2022).

Individual efforts are too small to matter unless they’re inspired by
Community a effort

atmospheric pollution and climate change

The latest IPCC report Calvin et al. (2023)

Dimock (2019)

-   kora 95% https://kora.app/

-   Earn KORA coins for reducing CO2 emissions

I, as the researcher, am similar to the blind people in the elephant
story; focusing on greening shopping, saving, and investing are only the
trunk of the enormous elephant that is environmental disaster unfolding
in front of our eyes.

## Results

The research helps me (and others) to

-   avoid reinventing the wheel and duplicating existing approaches.

-   It aims to help app developers maximize impact by aiding
    complementary additionality.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[1] }} />

-   Make high-quality products. If used wisely, money can help build
    communities of sustainable impact.

#### Define Words

Define every word in the title: “The Journey from Consumer to Investor:
Designing a Financial AI Companion for Young Adults to Help with
Sustainable Shopping, Savings, and Investing”

-   Journey - behavioral change takes time
-   Consumer - purchase goods without thinking about the effect
-   Investor - thinking about the return
-   Design - decisions
-   Financial - dealing with money
-   AI Companion - automated sidekick
-   Young Adults - College Students
-   Help - to be of assistance
-   Sustainable Shopping - shopping understanding the consequences
-   Sustainable Saving - in this context I mean Sustainable Savings,
    that is reducing one’s environmental footprint
-   Sustainable Investing - activity of thinking longer-term

## User Survey

Start with a simple but powerful question: — Does it matter what you
buy? — Does it matter how much you save? — Does it matter where you
invest? Why?

## Research Limitations

-   This work is focused on user experience design and does attempt to
    make a contribution to economics. Sacred Economics is use as-is as a
    framework and visualization tool.

-   First, finance is a highly regulated industry and the proposed user
    experience designs may be limited by legal requirements. This study
    does not take such limitations into account, rather focusing only on
    the user experience.

-   Finally, ESG needs data to give us an accurate understanding of the
    realities inside companies and the user experience design does not
    address the underlying data quality problem further than by
    providing a link to the data source.

-   Research Reason: While many people are working on AI models, there’s
    a lack of people working on “Human-AI interaction”. Sustainability
    is the context. How can we better team up to solve the challenges we
    face this century? The huge externalities.

-   I don’t have access to user financial data.

-   ESG data is expensive so couldn’t be used in this research.

## Future Research

The literature is rich and there is ample space for future research. The
following includes some suggestions for authors whose work deserves a
deeper look.

-   Does the specialized interface offer any advantages of a general UI
    such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Mistral, and others?
