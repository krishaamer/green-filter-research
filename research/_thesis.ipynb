        "\n",
        "College students are concerned with the environment, yet they are busy with school and hindered by unavailability of simple tools to affect systemic change. Stronger environmental policy from the European Union includes the concept of ***digital product passports***, which holds the promise to help distinguish ***eco-designed*** products made by ***circular economy*** companies trying to be zero-waste from companies that simply say they are. Tracking product data from the source materials until the consumer, combined with ***data-driven interaction design*** facilitates building transparency into opaque systems. Likewise, advances in the development of ***large-language models*** enables ***artificial intelligence assistants*** to become a translation layer between complex environmental data and human-comprehensible language.\n",
        "\n",
        "The emerging field of ***Planetary Health*** recognizes profound interconnections between our economic behaviors, ecosystem services such as clean water, air, soil, the climate crisis, and human health. As of 2024, Earth's natural environment is being heavily degraded by the extractive business practices of companies that make many of the products and services we buy every day. The way we use our money to interact with companies - through shopping as consumers and saving / investing as investors - has an effect on the life-supporting biosphere we rely on to keep our planet inhabitable. In essence, from an ecological perspective, every financial action is either an investment decision to support more environmentally-friendly companies - or to support polluters.\n",
        "\n",
        "My research addresses the need for tools to make sustainable financial action convenient for college students. I focus on leveraging ***design research*** to find design concepts for ***simple AI user interfaces*** also known as ***generative UI*** to help college students participate in ***sustainable financial activism***. A survey of 700 students across 10 universities in Taiwan was conducted, enhanced by 5 expert interviews providing industry insights. The major contribution of the study is an interactive AI-assistant prototype.\n",

Star Trek has a portable device called a ***tricorder*** (fig. 1), which enables imaginary future humans fix all kinds of problems from scanning for minerals inside a cave to scanning human bodies for medical information. I would love to have such a device for consumer choices and financial decisions - to know what to buy and which businesses to do business with. Robots are already integral part of our lives; this thesis proposal was partially written using Google's and Apple's Voice recognition software, allowing me to transcribe notes with the help of an AI assistant.\n",

        "As a foreigner living in Taiwan, I've relied extensively on AI assistants for many aspects of my life: to communicate, move around efficiently, find food and services. Even when we don't realize it, AI assistants helping us with many of our mundane tasks. When writing in Chinese, Apple's text prediction algorithms translate pinyin to 漢字 and show the most likely character based on my previous writing, Google's maps find efficient and eco-friendly routes and recommend places to eat and ChatGPT provides statistically probable advice from the sum of human knowledge. While it takes incredibly complex computational algorithms to achieve all this in the background, it's become so commonplace, we don't even think about it. From this point of view, another AI assistant to help humans with choosing more eco-friendly businesses to show, save, and invest doesn't sound so much of a stretch.\n",

        "## Research Objective\n",

        "Without reliable and easily accessible data, it seems impossible to know which company is more sustainable than the other. We don't really know what's green, unless we spend a lot of time looking at the numbers. Environmental issues are caused by production and manufacturing processes of the companies that make the products we consume on a daily basis. The study presents an AI companion design which seeks to help people build relationships with sustainability-focused companies. The major contribution of this study is an interactive artefact (a prototype) informed by design research.\n",

In the two decades that followed, from 1998 to 2018, Taiwan made progress in municipal waste management, rising to the status of a world-leader in recycling (2nd *effective recycling rate* after Germany); in addition to an effective recycling system, the average waste amount generated per person by 700g (from 1140g to 400g) per day; nonetheless, industrial recycling rates were less stellar, standing at 80% in 2020 and there were unrealized opportunities in using industry 4.0 technologies, such as internet of things (IoT) sensors for better waste tracking [@wuSupportingCircularEconomy2021; @buiMunicipalSolidWaste2023].\n",

The field is known today as *sustainable yield* of *natural capital* with a focus on maintaining *ecosystem services* [@peterkareivaNaturalCapitalTheory2011]. Aldo Leopold proposed the idea of *land ethics* as *\"\\[a\\] thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise\"* in his landmark work *A Sand County Almanac* [@leopoldSandCountyAlmanac1972]. The 1987 United Nations' Brundtland Report (Our Common Future) defined sustainable development as *\"Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\"* [@worldcommissiononenvironmentanddevelopmentOurCommonFuture1987].\n",

While awareness of Earth's warming climate was growing, the CO~2~ emissions kept rising too. The hockey-stick growth of CO~2~ concentration since the industrial revolution is clear in the data from 1958 onward, following a steady annual increase, called the *Keeling Curve* [@keelingAtmosphericMonthlySitu2017]. Written records of global temperature measurements are available starting from the 1880s when documentation of temperatures become available in ship records [@BrohanClimate2012].

Given this model of climate change, the G7 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, United States) are heading for 2.7 °C of warming by 2050 [@cdpMissingMarkCDP2022].

        "For decades, marketers and researchers have been researching how to affect human behavior towards increasing purchase decisions in commerce, both offline and online, which is why the literature on behavioral design is massive. One of the key concepts is *nudge*, first coined in 2008 by the Nobel-winning economist Richard Thaler; nudges are based on a scientific understanding of human psychology and shortcuts and triggers that human brains use and leverages that knowledge to influence humans in small but powerful ways [@thalerNudgeImprovingDecisions2009].\n",
        "\n",
        "The principles of nudge have also been applied to sustainability. For example, a small study (n=33) in the Future Consumer Lab in Copenhagen by @perez-cuetoNudgingPlantbasedMeals2021 found that designing a \"dish-of-the-day\" which was prominently displayed helped to increase vegetarian food choice by 85%. @GUATH2022101821 experiments (n=200) suggested nudging can be effective in influencing online shopping behavior towards more sustainable options.

        "By early 2024, widely available LLMs front-ends such as Gemini, Claude and ChatGPT have all released basic features for multi-modal communication. In practice, this means combination several AI models within the same interface. For example, on the input side, one model is used for human speech or image recognition which are transcribed into tokens that can be ingested into an LLM. On the output side, the LLM can generate instructions which are fed into an image / audio generation model or even computer code which can be ran on a virtual machine and then the output displayed inside the conversation.\n",

        "The quality of LLM output depends on the quality of the provided prompt. @zhouLargeLanguageModels2022 reports creating an \"Automatic Prompt Engineer\" which automatically generates instructions that outperform the baseline output quality by using another model in the AI pipeline in front of the LLM to enhance the human input with language that is known to produce better quality. This approach however is a moving target as foundational models keep changing rapidly and the baseline might differ from today to 6 months later.\n",

The test consists of a story and a question, which has a different meaning as the context changes: \"The trophy would not fit in the brown suitcase because it was too big\" - what does the *it* refer to? Humans are able to understand this from context while a computer models would fail. Even GPT-3 still failed the test, but later LLMs have been able to solve this test correctly (90% accuracy) @kocijanDefeatWinogradSchema2022.

        "\n",
        "The field of Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) emphasizes designing user experiences (UX) that cater to human needs [@theinternationalergonomicsassociationHumanFactorsErgonomics2019]. Designers think through every interaction of the user with a system and consider a set of metrics at each point of interaction including the user's context of use and emotional needs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Software designers, unlike industrial designers, can't physically alter the ergonomics of a device, which should be optimized for human well-being to begin with and form a cohesive experience together with the software. However, software designers can significantly reduce mental strain by crafting easy-to-use software and user-friendly user journeys. Software interaction design goes beyond the form-factor and accounts for human needs by using responsive design on the screen, aural feedback cues in sound design, and even more crucially, by showing the relevant content at the right time, making a profound difference to the experience, keeping the user engaged and returning for more. In the words of [@babichInteractionDesignVs2019], ***\"\\[T\\*\\*\\*\\]***he moment of interaction is just a part of the journey that a user goes through when they interact with a product. User experience design accounts for all user-facing aspects of a product or system\".\\*\\*\\*\n",
        "\n",
        "Drawing a parallel from narrative studies terminology, we can view user interaction as a heroic journey of the user to achieve their goals, by navigating through the interface until a success state - or facing failure. Storytelling has its part in interface design however designing for transparency is just as important, when we're dealing with the user's finances and sustainability data, which need to be communicated clearly and accurately, to build long-term trust in the service. For a sustainable investment service, getting to a state of success - or failure - may take years, and even longer. Given such long timeframes, how can the app provide support to the user's emotional and practical needs throughout the journey?\n",
        "\n",
        "[@tubikstudioUXDesignGlossary2018] argues ***affordance*** measures the clarity of the interface to take action in user experience design, rooted in human visual perception, however, affected by knowledge of the world around us. A famous example is the door handle - by way of acculturation, most of us would immediately know how to use it - however, would that be the case for someone who saw a door handle for the first time? A similar situation is happening to the people born today. Think of all the technologies they have not seen before - what will be the interface they feel the most comfortable with?\n",
        "\n",
        "For the vast majority of this study's target audience (college students), social media can be assumed as the primary interface through which they experience daily life. The widespread availability of mobile devices, cheap internet access, and AI-based optimizations for user retention, implemented by social media companies, means this is the baseline for young adult users' expectations (as of writing in 2020).\n",

The user interface might remain the same in terms of architecture, but the content is improved, based on personalization and understanding the user at a deeper level.\n",
        "\n",
        "When I began writing this thesis in 2020, Google had recently launched an improved natural language engine to better understand search queries [@UnderstandingSearchesBetter2019], which was considered the next step towards ***understanding*** human language semantics. The trend was clear, and different types of algorithms were already involved in many types of interaction design, however, we were in the early stages of this technology (and still are *early* in 2024). Today's ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini have no problem understanding human semantics - yet are they intelligent?\n",

That general observation applies to voice recognition, voice generation, natural language parsing, among others.

The interviews lasted between 9 and 21 minutes and were conducted to get some initial feedback on my research idea, the respondents' daily routines, app usage, feelings towards financial questions, including investing, relationship with nature, and environmental sustainability. These preliminary conversations led me to emphasize more on the financial journey, i.e., to consider the importance of the shopping, savings, and payments apps students already use daily, which could serve as an entry point to becoming an investor. I expect my future research findings to confirm this initial idea and offer diverse ways and examples of what that path could look like in practice.\n",
