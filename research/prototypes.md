## Product Features {#product-features}

-   Your Green Helper

-   Make some initial prototype? make youtube video… hi, you have reached? spread… through estban and others?

-   Currently CO2 footprint calculators ask you a couple of questions and give a ballpark estimate. Does it make sense to track sustainability on a more nuanced level, like Apple Health, in order to encourage sustainable behavior?

#### How might AI assistants empower regenerative shopping, saving, and investing? {#how-might-ai-assistants-empower-regenerative-shopping-saving-and-investing}

Display the ESG, EPR, B-Corp, etc, etc credentials for each product and investment.

EPR and B-Corp are success stories which shoul be highlighted while ESG is largely discredited.

There are many existing and ongoing approaches to sustainability. The best approach might be to plug into excisting system and communities and legislation to support and empower them.

## Shopping-as-Investing {#shopping-as-investing}

Introduce this concept

-   The Manor (2022)

#### Narrative Layouts {#narrative-layouts}

I’m basically building the UX of AI.. focused on sustainability.

Design System: https://zeroheight.com/8bf57183c/p/82fe98-introduction

How should the layout storyline be structured? Well it’s like Strava (that running app) for sustainability… or if you have heard of Welltory. I believe if I spent 5 minutes every day with a guide who could help me make more eco-friendly choices that would improve my life.. be it what I consume, save, invest, etc.. so I’m trying to design an app around this idea.
