<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Interviewee:</strong> 可持續性跟這個歷史問題。平常在逛的時候只會看到就是品牌國家跟那個使用材料，很少看到有這個「材料可持續性」跟「歷史問題」，所以買的時候就會覺得說，就是，哦，買完了可能就，就只是用完了也就只是垃圾，但是我沒有想到說，就是，哦，我沒有想到說就是可能面膜它裡面會有一些不明的植物萃取物跟化學保存劑。應該說是知道，可是不知道說就是它可能，嗯，會有存在風險之類的。</td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Interviewee:</strong> Sustainability and this history issue. Usually when browsing, I only see the brand’s country and the materials used. I rarely see this “Material Sustainability” and “History Issues”. So when buying, I would think, just, oh, after buying it, maybe it’s just, after using it up, it’s just trash. But I didn’t think that, like, oh, I didn’t think that maybe the facial mask could contain some unknown plant extracts and chemical preservatives. I should say I knew, but I didn’t know that it might, hmm, pose potential risks, things like that.</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Me:</strong> 那妳覺得這個，妳剛知道這個會影響妳的，妳的想法嗎？想法嗎？就是因為妳之前 (註: TXT 用 最近) 有買過這個產品，那妳剛知道好像它裡面可能有什麼化學的…妳對妳關於那個這個產品的那個品牌，妳的想法會改嗎？</td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Me:</strong> So you think this, knowing this just now, will it affect your, your thoughts? Your thoughts?

<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Interviewee:</strong> 嗯，會有一點點，會有一點點。可能會去找可能更方便的吧，就是不需要用到面膜，可能只要，嗯，要怎麼說…就是有，有看到就是不需要敷面膜，就是很像就是塗那個…塗，塗那種蘆薈的那種面膜，應該可能之後會買這種。</td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Interviewee:</strong> Hmm, a little bit, a little bit. Maybe I’ll look for something more convenient, like something that doesn’t require using a sheet mask, maybe just, hmm, how should I say… like, I’ve seen ones where you don’t need to apply a sheet mask, it’s like applying… applying that kind of aloe mask, maybe I’ll buy that kind later.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Me:</strong> 嗯嗯嗯。好，那下面有一個部分可以按，妳覺得這個，這個是什麼意思？</td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Me:</strong> Mm-hmm mm-hmm. Okay, there’s a section below you can press. What do you think this, this means?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Interviewee:</strong> 積蓄 (註: TXT 誤聽為 金序) 嗎？嗯？假如說我不買這個東西啊，我可以存到多少錢嗎？</td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Interviewee:</strong> Savings (Note: TXT misheard as “Gold Order”)? Hmm? Suppose if I don’t buy this item, can I save some amount of money?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Me:</strong> 好。那妳要先，呃，思考。</td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Me:</strong> Okay. Then you need to first, uh, think.</td>

<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Interviewee:</strong> 在思考…妳要吃什麼？我沒有錢吃。 …妳要給我錢，好嗎？</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Interviewee:</strong> 哦…哦！所以積蓄是那個碳排放量 (註: TXT 誤聽為 彈放量)，減少碳排放量？不會是錢？喔？然後說我不買那個面膜我可以…我可以省多少錢？喔，好貴。</td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Interviewee:</strong> Oh… Oh! So savings means the carbon emissions (Note: TXT misheard as “bullet release amount”), reducing carbon emissions? Not money? Oh? And it says if I don’t buy that mask I can… I can save how much money? Oh, so expensive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Me:</strong> 所以中文來說，可能這個詞 (註: TXT 誤聽為 車) 不是最適合的。就是剛剛那個詞 (註: TXT 誤聽為 車)，因為妳剛剛是想…</td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Me:</strong> So in Chinese, maybe this word (Note: TXT misheard as “car”) isn’t the most suitable. Just that word (Note: TXT misheard as “car”) earlier, because you were thinking…</td>

<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Interviewee:</strong> Right, right, right. I thought it was about not buying this thing, or maybe, maybe buying this thing could save how much money, or not buying this thing might save how much money. This “Savings”, I feel… how should I look at it (Note: TXT misheard as “dry”)?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Me:</strong> 好。那第三個部分，投資？</td>

<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Me:</strong> 好，那妳可以幫我回第一個部分嗎？第一個，買東西。然後下面下面下面…對，有兩個按鈕。如果妳不想要按也可以。</td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Me:</strong> Okay, can you help me go back to the first section? The first one, buying things. Then below, below, below… Right, there are two buttons. If you don’t want to press them, that’s okay too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Interviewee:</strong> 欸，等我看一下。哇哇哇，這個有點跑掉了。嗯…哇喔。我想一下…「對關心環保 (註: TXT 誤聽為 光環保) 的消費者來說，選擇可持續性的品牌可能會更好。以下是可替代的品牌，並附上簡單的比較表」。哦…這個，這個…那個，它可以再隔一個空位嗎？對，有點看不太懂。</td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Interviewee:</strong> Hey, let me take a look. Wow wow wow, this one is a bit off. Hmm… Wow oh. Let me think… “For consumers concerned about environmental protection (Note: TXT misheard as”only environmental protection”), choosing sustainable brands might be better. Below are alternative brands with a simple comparison table attached.” Oh… This, this… that, can it have another space? Right, it’s a bit hard to understand.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Me:</strong> 好。好。那妳覺得…妳有另外一個按鈕 (註: TXT 誤聽為 案子)，妳想要問 (註: TXT 誤聽為 玩) AI嗎？</td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Me:</strong> Okay. Okay. So do you think… you have another button (Note: TXT misheard as “case”), do you want to ask (Note: TXT misheard as “play”) the AI?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Interviewee:</strong> AI嗎？隨便都可以。嗯…我想想看喔…「產品會浪費掉多少的碳排放量」？(註: TXT 誤聽為 網品櫃/癱瘓量) …按到了。</td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Interviewee:</strong> AI? Anything is fine. Hmm… Let me think… “How much carbon emission will the product waste?” (Note: TXT misheard as “Net product counter/paralysis amount”) …Pressed it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Me:</strong> 欸，等一下，按到了。</td>

<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Me:</strong> 哇，好清楚喔。</td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Me:</strong> Wow, so clear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Me:</strong> 好。那要說什麼？妳覺得最…重點是什麼？</td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Me:</strong> Okay. What should I say? What do you think is the most… main point?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Interviewee:</strong> 重點是什麼？蠻多的捏。就是光是從生產過程就已經開始產生碳排放，然後包裝本來就是也會產生，運輸過程也不用說就是本來就會產生的，只是我沒有想到說就是，最後的使用跟處理，使用過程中的水電消耗以及產品的包裝最終處理回收或掩埋，也會影響到碳排放。</td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Interviewee:</strong> What’s the main point? There’s quite a lot. Just from the production process, carbon emissions already start being generated. Then packaging itself also generates them. The transportation process goes without saying, it inherently generates them. It’s just that I didn’t think about, like, the final use and disposal, the water and electricity consumption during use, and the final disposal of the product’s packaging – recycling or landfill – would also affect carbon emissions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Me:</strong> 嗯。好。那這樣就可以了。妳幫我拍照這個畫面 (註: TXT 誤聽為 玩意)，還有那個剛剛那個Momo…Momo，對。好，Momo，等一下…這個部分就可以了。好的。</td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Me:</strong> Hmm. Okay. That’s fine then. Help me take a photo of this screen (Note: TXT misheard as “thingy”), and also that Momo from just now… Momo, right. Okay, Momo, wait a moment… this part is fine. Okay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Interviewee:</strong> 這上面有…</td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Interviewee:</strong> On top here there’s…</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Me:</strong> …那個號碼，接收號碼，這個，那個幫我寫。</td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><strong>Me:</strong> …that number, the receiving number, this one, help me write that one down.</td>

## Appendix 1: College Students’ In-Person Prototype Testing Transcripts

Due to the large amount data captured by the in-person interview
performed for testing with 32 people at 6 universities, I’ve chosen to
exclude the full dataset from the PDF version of my thesis. The data is
available upon request - and has also been published on Hugging Face as
publicly:
https://huggingface.co/datasets/krishaamer/taiwanese-college-students

Below is a small example of the data gathered.

## Appendix 2: College Students’ Prototype Self-Testing Survey Data

Due to the large amount data captured by the survey (over 100 people
self-tested the Green Filter app and 32 people filled out the survey
after in-person testing was completed), I’ve chosen to exclude it from
the PDF version of my thesis. The data is available upon request - and
has also been published on Hugging Face as a public dataset here:
https://huggingface.co/datasets/krishaamer/taiwanese-college-students

## Appendix 3: Expert Interviews’ Transcripts

Due to the length, I’ve decided to exclude full raw interview
transcripts. The data is available upon request. Below is one example
interview transcript.

### Example Expert Interview 2024-05-19 - Chen-Ying Huang

MA Thesis: “Green Filter” (綠濾) (2024-05-19 11:07 GMT+8) - Transcript
Attendees Chen-Ying Huang, Fireflies.ai Notetaker Kris, Kris Haamer,
Kris Haamer’s Presentation Transcript This editable transcript was
computer generated and might contain errors. People can also change the
text after it was created. Kris Haamer: Yeah, so let me repeat the
question so I can get your answer into this recording. Chen-Ying Huang:
Okay. Kris Haamer: So we’re discussing the flow of the user and how it
affects the decisions,… Chen-Ying Huang: right So basically I’m thinking
that people are lazy. Kris Haamer: right? Chen-Ying Huang: I look at
myself. I’m really lazy When shopping and so you should if it’s easier
to get the information that I don’t have to click on the button to
receive the information. It’s more likely that I will even pay attention
to that and… Kris Haamer: Right, right. Chen-Ying Huang: also that words
are very difficult to read through so I don’t really have incentive to
read a lot but it was just a picture and showing that the product
somehow it’s green like saving whatever picture you can put on the
iceberg or the polar bear or whatever that’s Chen-Ying Huang: That will
immediately let me realize that this product is green and maybe there it
could be a scale like House Green it is from zero to a hundred and then
I can immediately know how green this product is. Kris Haamer: even
Chen-Ying Huang: Maybe there would be infected on me. So I’m thinking
more along this line. Kris Haamer: right, right, visually understandable
or really quickly understandable images instead of this kind of report.
Chen-Ying Huang: right Yeah. Kris Haamer: Yeah. I haven’t tested that
how this research started was from my kind of own interest that I don’t
even ever rushed Star Trek, the science fiction so it has some medical
professionals and they’ll have a scanner and then they can scan your
whole body, Chen-Ying Huang: Yeah, yeah. Okay. Kris Haamer: just by
waving the scanner and they will understand what’s wrong with you. So
every time I bought some product I felt like I want this kind of scanner
just to give me a quick information about is this a good product? And I
thought I try to build something like that. Chen-Ying Huang: Okay. Kris
Haamer: But then I realized if I actually want to make a working
prototype and this is really difficult to do on a mobile phone, even
though that would be the obvious choice. Because the Apple ecosystem is
close so you can’t really do a lot of things. On the mobile phone, but
on the Google Chrome browser. It’s very open so I can take any website
like Momo and I can just kind of rewrite the page. Using the plugin.
Chen-Ying Huang: Okay. Kris Haamer: So that’s how I ended up, going to
the online shopping and more particularly. And then, actually make it
technically work. Then AI is slow that is the main question. So if I
kind of breathe premade these pages and then test it I could do, those
kind of pre-made images or pre-made reports. But this is actually
working in real time. So you can go to any page on Mama and it will do
this analysis. using actual data so that is the reason why there’s a
button instead of kind of a primate bring my thing and then Maybe I’ll
just kind of continue from So down here. I also came up with this kind
of scoring. Kris Haamer: Because my intuition was that maybe the social.
aspects of a product so other people who bought the product Kris Haamer:
and their opinion of it could also be relevant but so far among those,
20 people actually, saw this they didn’t honestly understand what these
numbers were or why they were there none of them understood it. and then
if you can actually get down here, there’s another button that takes you
a new page and Kris Haamer: then you get to the actual app kind of part
which is much bigger and that I have more control over than a Momo page
because even though the Chrome browser is quite open still there are a
lot of limitations on for example, how can I attract the user? So if you
come to this page I can track where do you scroll and where does your
cursor go and a lot of detail about your usage of this page. I can track
all of that and use that data. 00:05:00 Chen-Ying Huang: Wait, so you
are not right randomly sampling people from Momo, right? You are asking
subject to participate in your experiment, So in that sense,… Kris
Haamer: Yes, yes. Chen-Ying Huang: wouldn’t it be possible that? So you
want a natural environment where there are shopping? Is that the idea?
Otherwise, why wouldn’t it be possible but then to read some information
about the product here the information you provide before they really
look at the specification of the product itself. Kris Haamer: Mm- So
yes, I think because I’m from the design department. So our approach to
doing this experiments is not very scientific. So a lot of times I don’t
know we’ve heard about design thinking is kind of a type of I would say
quasi research. you do some workshops or you get some people and try to
Kris Haamer: Use this kind of format of it’s called The Double Diamond.
So you kind of try to get some kind of data from out of it, but it’s not
scientific at all. It’s just mostly try to give you some kind of
keywords or intonation what would work so I try to do better than that
and do this kind of survey which as my Chinese and isn’t enough to do
this kind of interviews with people really or things like that. So I
focus on a survey And the survey mostly. it’s 63 questions so I can get
a lot of data from that and then I use some kind of Gaming’s K means so
it’s a computer algorithm that takes all of this data. Kris Haamer:
Points and then create free profiles based on similarity. So maybe I
just shared that patient. Chen-Ying Huang: Mmm Yeah Kris Haamer: It’s
easier to talk about if you can actually see what I did. Chen-Ying
Huang: It from the survey data. Kris Haamer: Let’s hear that. Kris
Haamer: so this is the three type of personas they came up with from the
data and… Chen-Ying Huang: Okay, okay. Kris Haamer: Yes, yes, and there
are different ways to do that. This is based on Chen-Ying Huang: so
basically that one Persona is that they really care about the
environment Kris Haamer: all of the data you could I also had a part
that I only had questions about kind of product features what you want
and then I could get different types of personas based only on that
single question. and a little bit different but yeah, so basically I got
this three personas and Chen-Ying Huang: yeah. Kris Haamer: Yes, so this
is the most friendly one. But if you look at the three different
personas, there’s this overlap concern on things. So like I mentioned
before the product origin, it’s relevant for edit pretty much, most of
the people who did the serving. and then The materials is more important
for the parently Persona and… Chen-Ying Huang: Okay. Kris Haamer: less
for Frugal they will care more about money if it’s expensive or not. And
they’re like the social aspect, I had the social score interact
actually, most of the people maybe didn’t understand or didn’t care
about it. So at least It wasn’t relevant. so basically After doing all
of that. I still need to. Test what I actually built. and I was talking
to my professor from about different ways of doing it And the citation
was just go one more one by one and get people to use the actual app.
not give that much information and then kind of see what they do with
the app and how far they get. 00:10:00 Kris Haamer: because if I go back
to what was the actual idea of the research was that? I thought maybe.
Chen-Ying Huang: but Kris Haamer: Maybe it can be a journey, maybe the
product is an entry point. And I could create a funnel and get those
people. To invest into that company in some way. So investing here means
in a really white sense, either just buying those products from them or
efriendly company, or maybe becoming like a shareholder. Chen-Ying
Huang: no. Kris Haamer: And when I started this I I can do this. But by
now I’m thinking this is way too big of a project for a master’s degree.
Because shopping and there’s even saving here and investing. There’s so
much different research about each of them and there’s not much overlap.
and maybe I’m kind of in a somewhat, new territory trying to combine
those things and why I maybe had the courage to try to combine those
things is because I was just right naive and not with an economics
background or… Chen-Ying Huang: don’t Kris Haamer: not without Finance
background. I was thinking in terms of the user interface. And I can
build this funnel and get those people into that funnel and… Chen-Ying
Huang: Okay, okay, but it’s still good to have a dream. Kris Haamer:
maybe get them to the end. But now when I’m realizing that I can’t even
get people from the moment page into my app… Chen-Ying Huang: Kris
Haamer: because most of them disappear, in the first step. Then I start
to realize that the investing staff is so far that maybe Sears here or
zero point one person that people actually get there. Chen-Ying Huang:
Know yeah. Yeah. Kris Haamer: but yeah. Kris Haamer: But I mean maybe
it’s also valid for research to say it is, it’s really hard to get those
people from point zero to that far away place and that’s a really
outcome. Kris Haamer: Yeah, but coming back to this app. So, as I think
there’s shopping there’s savings and there’s investing. And actually
trying to build that funnel. how do you build that funnel? So I ended
up. because chat CPT so popular are so in many ways. I try to build
friendly Church APD here. Chen-Ying Huang: Okay. Kris Haamer: and give
the user Some questions and… Chen-Ying Huang: I’m fine question really
interesting. Where can I buy those products in Thai not I think that’s a
useful question. Kris Haamer: those questions are mostly based on the
service. Chen-Ying Huang: That will attract my attention. Kris Haamer:
What was seem to be relevant in the survey? And you can ask your own
questions. Kris Haamer: But most people when the tested it they didn’t
really know… Chen-Ying Huang: Yeah, yeah. Kris Haamer: what to ask. Kris
Haamer: Yes, I try to be localized. it seems that the more precise and
relevant and personalized you are more the higher the conversion rate,
it seems that you’re talking about a specific thing. Chen-Ying Huang:
Okay. Kris Haamer: and then this is not ready yet, but Let’s say I will
ask it. Kris Haamer: right Kris Haamer: just use this keyword. And it
will generate. Kris Haamer: so this page is not ready, but it will
generate for example a map of factories. And so you could see how this
product actually comes from here. And then maybe you could see pictures
from the factory. and why I started build this page is Particularly for
food products. So let’s say from buying milk or meat or whatever, a food
product you could ask about the product and you can see how far it came
from, but the conditions of those animals there. Kris Haamer: And maybe
those pictures could be like a live stream or… Chen-Ying Huang: it’s
Kris Haamer: you could have a really transparent insight into what is
food and where it came from. But that data is very hard to get. I guess
so. So for now, it’s just like a mocha. That’s right. It is not real
data. 00:15:00 Kris Haamer: because this is I said a journey, So I kind
of had this section of here so you could set your kind of Financial
goal. What do you want to achieve? Kris Haamer: Based on the testing it
seems that the students who got to this page. Mostly they had really
similar ideas about the future, because they are better students. So
they talk about how maybe I wanted to master degree or get a job or
those people nobody said they’d want to start a company or anything
Really entrepreneurial most of them gave a really standard answer. So
actually it ended up not being so useful. Chen-Ying Huang: Okay. Kris
Haamer: I thought first Maybe I could, have a really specific code here.
Because the AI will take that into account. I could give them more
specific advice. And then, we talked about investing so I had this idea
of having your kind of stock portfolio here. So this is actually real
data. and when I started to get this data, I also want to Chen-Ying
Huang: Okay. Kris Haamer: have ESG data live here, but then I realized
and that was actually crucial finding for me. Yesterday that I so
expensive. To get this graph up here it cost maybe for the USD. This is
stock data from us markets. But if I want to get ESC data here, it costs
4000 USD. Kris Haamer: 4,000 and as a consumer that’s already obviously,
impossible, there should be someone paying that cost. but currently ESG
data, even though it’s exist and it’s monthly so far. It’s not real
time, but it’s monthly monthly is pretty good. So you have monthly data
about the company and to see how they’re doing in terms of, their
approach to environment and social and governance. And you could have
that on the product page even on the mobile page. Maybe that would have
some kind of influence because you could see how this seems really
transparent. And this company recently, is not doing so well in terms of
paying their employees or the approach to nature. Maybe I will avoid
this product. Kris Haamer: But currently I couldn’t get that data. I
only got data for companies that actually take their own data and put
them on their website for free. I could get that data. So right now the
only way I could do that is to make a fake mock-up maybe only users
couple of companies that I could get every data for but the real data
that wasn’t monthly that was from the last year. So there’s this time
difference. So as you can see, it’s goes into many different directions
because where I work on this I can see they’re like Kris Haamer: Rabbit
holes to go down into right and in my email, I even mentioned,
particular talk about economics in Europe. We have more and more people
talking about the growth and donut economy and all this kind of A new
economics I guess. more people are talking about that. and that’s one of
the reasons why I want to have this call to have an actual Economist
talk to me about this topics. because if I read those papers and if I
look at what those people are talking about and mostly they’re saying
which is Kris Haamer: Me to produce less and produce better things. and…
Chen-Ying Huang: just Kris Haamer: just kind of reduce the economy and
not have economic growth at least in particular sections of the economy
and maybe have economic growth in some section of the economy. I know
these are kind of no-go areas,… Chen-Ying Huang: Actually, I haven’t
read anything about that are interested in that I can properly introduce
a colleague of mine to you that he might be more likely to have read
that. Kris Haamer: I guess from Media because economic growth is what
politicians talk about at least in Estonia. I guess also in Taiwan and…
Chen-Ying Huang: So just from reading your email,… Kris Haamer: and when
I get your sense of these new economic. Chen-Ying Huang: I thought that
I can contribute a little bit probably just a little bit that into your
first goal trying to influence the shopping Behavior. 00:20:00 Kris
Haamer: I guess new models. And have you read anything about it, or have
you had any interest? Chen-Ying Huang: So the other goals I think are a
bit big for me. So Kris Haamer: Okay. Chen-Ying Huang: my intuition is
just to make the information relevant and simple. So then you have
better chances to influence the shopping behavior and most in I talk
about introducing an option that is obviously worse and sometimes it
works. So if you have instead of one option at the one time then you
have A decoy option that is obviously in terms of environmental
friendliness that it’s even worse than the target. And then in my make
it. Chen-Ying Huang: Yeah. Chen-Ying Huang: Yeah. Kris Haamer: So if you
go to this moment page, so one thing that I would say. a lot of people
mention was curious for me was the sidebar and left side. So they would
look at the alternatives. and so In terms of the environmental report, I
don’t even focus on this particular product. So if you have some kind of
decoy… Chen-Ying Huang: right Right,… Chen-Ying Huang: nothing one most
useful way. Is that the maybe… Kris Haamer: then that would be like a
product comparison maybe and… Kris Haamer: to have those reports made
for a bunch of products and… Chen-Ying Huang: if I revealing that how
much the company would actually invest or… Kris Haamer: in that category
and… Chen-Ying Huang: spend the Kris Haamer: have some kind of like a
sidebar or… Chen-Ying Huang: Spent their profit in green organization,…
Kris Haamer: Capital products similar products similar category may be…
Chen-Ying Huang: that would be Costless to the consumer,… Kris Haamer:
but different scoring. on this report Okay. Chen-Ying Huang: but that
kind of information. May help in the sense that I feel that I’m paying
the same amount of money to firm Ai but would be contributing part of
the profit to the society then it’s like a free good to me. So I Would
be more willing to do that conditional on that. They are competitive in
terms of price. Chen-Ying Huang: Works. Yeah. Yeah, so that would
probably work. but Detail information like this. I think you are
targeting experts instead of a general consumers that… Kris Haamer:
right Chen-Ying Huang: who are just rushing and buying things out of I
don’t know I think that to them or… Kris Haamer: Right, right. It would
make it very obvious,… Chen-Ying Huang: to me. I think the key Point
still whether the product has the specification that I want and… Kris
Haamer: which is the better choice. Chen-Ying Huang: whether the prices
reasonable and… Kris Haamer: Okay. Chen-Ying Huang: whether it is it has
a good reputation that it’s durable than the product is good. So How to
kill that it’s not very easy, but there’s still some ways I can do it.
What have you tried to search? some web pages where they try to sell
green products, they must have figured out a way. Kris Haamer: Right,
right, right. Chen-Ying Huang: yeah. Chen-Ying Huang: Okay, okay. Kris
Haamer: Yes, yes, so mostly there’s just Queen shopping malls that green
Online stores and they will create those products for you. but Kind of
my understanding is you have to be already a green consumer before? So
to go to those pages because they are not those amazing pages. So that’s
why I focused on Momo and this app also works on Shall be another coupon
and other kind of very mainstream I guess coupon is the new one growing
one. But then the issue that came up was, even more basic and the more I
research it seems like just the very basic issues are where people get
stuck, right? so Kris Haamer: On coupon and on shopee just a layout of
the page is different. And so it’s really hard to see this AI box into
that layout. 00:25:00 Chen-Ying Huang: But I mean for those spring web
page,… Kris Haamer: And… Chen-Ying Huang: they still have to sort of.
Kris Haamer: we couldn’t really find it and… Chen-Ying Huang: Do they
still reveal some information about… Kris Haamer: and more modern
there’s just kind of more space for it layout at the moment makes it
easier to put the AI here that’s the reason… Chen-Ying Huang: which
product it’s Greener? I mean all of the products are green. No, so they
don’t. Kris Haamer: why I focused on Mama because it seems that even
though half of the people gonna find it on Momo, but on the other Pages
it was even harder. Chen-Ying Huang: Okay. Chen-Ying Huang: Yeah. Kris
Haamer: No. No, no. No, they don’t really to Discount comparisons. They
just create a bunch of products and they say this is called King Green
products. So they go into much detail, but there’s a bunch of kind of
rating sites, especially for particular Industries. For example, in
There’s the fashion transparency index. And they will do product
analysis and brand analysis and they will go into a lot of detail. So,
if I want to focus This research on your fashion that would and…
Chen-Ying Huang: he Kris Haamer: closing that would Help me to actually
make those kind of reports much more precise. Chen-Ying Huang: Okay.
Kris Haamer: but then the problem becomes like when I want to test Momo
and then should I ask the user look for a brand of clothes that you like
or for now, I just keep it very open. I just ask them to look for any
product that they like because I thought that would be more relevant, if
they have brand family. Kris Haamer: But then it becomes that. They look
for the product that they like and… Chen-Ying Huang: You are asking
people to look for the item they want but at the end that there’s still
looking for the aspiration item,… Kris Haamer: mostly it’s a brand that
is an aspirational brand, people look for luxury brands or… Chen-Ying
Huang: I mean it’s even… Kris Haamer: you… Chen-Ying Huang: if they look
at the camera still it’s not a purchasing experiment in your survey,…
Kris Haamer: they can’t afford. And how useful is that really because if
you look for things that you can afford you’re not gonna buy anyway.
Chen-Ying Huang: It’s still possible that just look up at the camera.
Kris Haamer: So, why look at the sustainability report? Chen-Ying Huang:
But at the end I still don’t buy it. So in that sense. that Chen-Ying
Huang: Okay. Kris Haamer: Yes, so I think the way I tested this
currently not working. So I kind of want to redesign my testing and try
to do that before this semester ends in June. Kris Haamer: And I’m a
little bit confused. what would be the best way to do it? And so I
thought because now I managed to make this available on that Google web
app store so you can actually download it yourself to your browser. Kris
Haamer: So because the survey works so well and the survey works so well
because it’s mostly people just filling it out. I thought I’d try to.
get more data like this to have to ask people to download it and then
fill out the survey And so the survey is actually the same survey and
then I could do matching. What type of persona they… Chen-Ying Huang: So
basically your idea now is that you the subject or… Kris Haamer: because
currently what happens. Is that even though do the testing I don’t know
who they are. Chen-Ying Huang: whatever that in your experiment would do
the survey first. Kris Haamer: So it becomes kind of disconnected from
my survey results,… Chen-Ying Huang: And then they will have this
purchasing. Kris Haamer: but if they fill out the survey then Even if I
have a little bit of data about the usage. It’s useful because I know
who they are. Kris Haamer: Yeah. Chen-Ying Huang: mmm Kris Haamer: And I
would ask them to kind of download to their own computer because I’m
also realized if they do all my computer. So the way I did it, I just
went to people on campus and asked them and then I helped them to kind
of use it on my computer. but instead of doing that I could reduce my
own implants on it and asked them to download their Chrome browser and
Chrome is likely used, it’s like three billion people. Everybody has a
growing browser. So if they downloaded their own browser, 00:30:00
Chen-Ying Huang: Then I think you probably only need to have two apps
one is green app. Kris Haamer: they will feel more comfortable maybe in
that environment on their own computer instead of having to you…
Chen-Ying Huang: The other is not so green at or… Kris Haamer: And kind
of telling me… Chen-Ying Huang: it’s just a control app. And then
whatever experiment you want to run. Kris Haamer: what they want to do
and especially because we’re doing it in Chinese,… Kris Haamer: So
there’s a lot of data loss, if they say something that I don’t
understand in Chinese and… Chen-Ying Huang: And the remaining whatever
experimental surveying one… Chen-Ying Huang: who runs stay the same. So
you ask a set of people try to install the app? Kris Haamer: already
that information is gone. Chen-Ying Huang: One is the green app. The
other is a control app. And then you try to compare the difference of
behavior. Maybe the hypothetical purchasing Behavior at the end. It has
an effect then it has an effect. because the two groups are randomly
assigned to the app so you can reasonably assume that it’s the app that
is making the difference. Chen-Ying Huang: So this way you don’t. Yeah,
you just have to figure out a controller. to do that Chen-Ying Huang:
you can do it step by step. Kris Haamer: Okay, right. Kris Haamer: right
I kind of Realized that and… Chen-Ying Huang: Yeah. Yeah. Kris Haamer:
makes me very sad because I wanted to get people down the funnel through
the actual. Chen-Ying Huang: Okay. Kris Haamer: Yeah, yeah. Because I’m
losing a lot most of the people on the first or second step. So all of
the work I put into building all that AI stuff. most of the people don’t
even get there so Yeah,… Chen-Ying Huang: so, can you show me the first
click a little bit Can we go back to yeah. Kris Haamer: so I somehow.
Kris Haamer: I also don’t feel like you have to separately because how
did they get there? there’s no context for them to get there. But if
it’s inside a mama and they will click on the button. Then it creates
the context that they would,… Chen-Ying Huang: Recently, I’m thinking
about travel. so Kris Haamer: be kind of on that first step of the
funnel. Chen-Ying Huang: it’s a travel like Maybe plane ticket whatever.
Kris Haamer: Right let’s Tell me that you tell me a product that you
like or… Chen-Ying Huang: But it’s not a moment. So Let’s say luggage.
Kris Haamer: a brand that you like. Chen-Ying Huang: Okay, whatever.
Kris Haamer: anything that’s like okay, let’s say Kris Haamer: Right. I
don’t think. exactly, so Chen-Ying Huang: So where’s your click, Kris
Haamer: My very slow here. Which one would you pick here? Chen-Ying
Huang: Okay. Kris Haamer: that’s Kris Haamer: Mm-hmm, Because the
Internet is slow in Macau. Chen-Ying Huang: is this only place you can
put it? Kris Haamer: I think it’s takes a while to load. But yeah now
it’s here. Kris Haamer: So currently looks like that and… Chen-Ying
Huang: Okay. Kris Haamer: then you actually have to click on here but
because Chen-Ying Huang: Okay. Kris Haamer: A lot of people missed it.
So I’m thinking I was just making more obvious Chen-Ying Huang: That’s
okay. That’s okay. That’s okay. Just thinking you put it next to the
price. Okay. Kris Haamer: so putting some kind of like Kris Haamer: I
plan to put it next to the price because Okay,… Chen-Ying Huang: Yeah,
sure. Kris Haamer: right now there’s Danica problems. Chen-Ying Huang:
So what is the percentage of people clicking? Kris Haamer: I think it’s
because I’m in my car. Kris Haamer: I am Kris Haamer: Yes, yes. Because
I would say most of the people will look at the price,… Chen-Ying Huang:
about half okay. Kris Haamer: So that next to the price then you would
say it. Chen-Ying Huang: a half Kris Haamer: so out of those 20 people
who would click it without me suggesting it would be about half. But
yeah, but because I want to get them to the next page then I suggested
it and then I got those other half the coaching the next page. Yeah.
00:35:00 Kris Haamer: and then we can also just Kris Haamer: just ask
for a travel product here Kris Haamer: What’s the brand Travel Fox?
Okay. Chen-Ying Huang: Okay, yeah. Chen-Ying Huang: It’s an interesting
thought and it’s really impressive that you put this into action and…
Kris Haamer: I think there’s some. Problem with the internet here…
Chen-Ying Huang: already come up with this so far. Kris Haamer: because
it’s just not loading. Chen-Ying Huang: Yeah, but I feel that… Kris
Haamer: Yeah. yeah,… Chen-Ying Huang: if you can. Somehow increase the …
Kris Haamer: I realized the internet is much more restricted and
Chen-Ying Huang: I think my only question would be that how do you make
it more? Likely that people click on the first button and then after you
they click on the first part and how do you make sure they click through
it and look at more information? I think that’s a key to me. Kris
Haamer: right Kris Haamer: I think that’s useful for me also… Chen-Ying
Huang: bye. Kris Haamer: because it’s kind of confirmed concern That you
as an economic Economist think about this funnels in a very similar way,
as like website marketers or startup people. They think about how do
they grow their company and most it’s about, getting people that the
next page,… Chen-Ying Huang: I have a colleague… Kris Haamer: you…
Chen-Ying Huang: who yeah,… Kris Haamer: keep getting people to click
through the payment and… Chen-Ying Huang: he’s an econometrician,… Kris
Haamer: actually doing the payment and… Chen-Ying Huang: but he’s doing
climate change. Kris Haamer: there’s people disappearing on age that
Chen-Ying Huang: So I can’t email him and… Kris Haamer: And … Chen-Ying
Huang: and put you into contact with him. Kris Haamer: you said that you
had a colleague… Chen-Ying Huang: And also I also have a colleague… Kris
Haamer: who would maybe relevant, you… Chen-Ying Huang: I believe she is
in the international business department of NTU go Mount Si. Kris
Haamer: who are the Red, more about the new economics? Chen-Ying Huang:
And she’s basically doing marketing. So if you want to have I believe
that she has done some more feel like experiment like this. Kris Haamer:
Okay. Kris Haamer: that would be amazing. Yeah. Chen-Ying Huang: so if
you need help in Chen-Ying Huang: How to make people clicking through
your web page. I think she is a better person than me to approach you.
because she knows a lot more marketing people knows a lot more. Kris
Haamer: Okay. Chen-Ying Huang: Though It’s just like a Layman idea, but
she will know better. So I think I can write an email and put you into
contact with these two colleagues then. Yeah, yeah. Kris Haamer: Okay.
Chen-Ying Huang: is Chen-Ying Huang: yeah. Kris Haamer: Thanks so much.
That would be amazing. Yes. I’m also trying to wrap all of this into a
presentation that fits into this is defense. And it’s just way too many
things. But I still need to. Kris Haamer: have some type of rounding to
it and the grounding would be I guess just like the economic theory and
the idea that many people are trying different things to fight climate
change, right and I’m gonna mention that there are those people, think
of macroeconomics and… Chen-Ying Huang: But that sounds more like a
motivation of your research,… Kris Haamer: think about, just producing
the economy and… Chen-Ying Huang: So I wouldn’t worry that much about
that. Kris Haamer: and not having growth and… Chen-Ying Huang: I will
worry more about the click through rate… Kris Haamer: I kind of Need to
put all of those Concepts into concept map for my teachers to
understand… Chen-Ying Huang: because that’s where the data is from. So I
think that by talking to other people that will help you design or… Kris
Haamer: where worries my research base right why I’m focusing on this
stuff here. Chen-Ying Huang: change a little bit. Kris Haamer: Because
there are so many different ways to approach climate change. Chen-Ying
Huang: And then you can have a higher click through that rate. Kris
Haamer: and so Chen-Ying Huang: Then you will be able to do whatever you
want to do, right? So. Kris Haamer: yes, yes. Yes. Chen-Ying Huang: I
think that’s a key. Yeah. 00:40:00 Kris Haamer: Okay, okay. Chen-Ying
Huang: right if you change it to other things then and then you see the
difference now. Kris Haamer: Right, right. Chen-Ying Huang: so much
without the teacher just This is more a questioning mark instead that
you try to say something nice or… Kris Haamer: yes, yes and in that
sense, and if you look at Kris Haamer: The moment page, just changing
that, one sentence in Chinese here. could be like a key,… Chen-Ying
Huang: something in a positive way. Kris Haamer: because some people say
it’s very awkward right now. but Kris Haamer: Why it’s so weighing in
our sense is because I didn’t want to specifically say this is like a
sustainability report. Chen-Ying Huang: You said you want to stay
neutral, The emergency. Chen-Ying Huang: How did you touch so much
Champion? Kris Haamer: because I was afraid of preaching to the crowd in
a sense, I wanted to be Kind of General enough that even… Chen-Ying
Huang: Yeah. Yeah. Kris Haamer: if you’re not the green crowd, you are
just don’t really care about sustainability person. You will still click
on it. And maybe you will learn something. Chen-Ying Huang: There could
be better ways to phrase achy PT can help you with that. Just skiing
this straight. Kris Haamer: Yeah. Chen-Ying Huang: okay. Kris Haamer:
because people care about money right people care what happens to their
money,… Chen-Ying Huang: Okay. Kris Haamer: so that’s why That’s yeah.
Chen-Ying Huang: Can you scroll down a little bit? let me just want to
see the whole box. Okay, two sounds yeah, okay. Kris Haamer: What I’ve
had maybe 50 versions of that. But how long did I focus on that? Yeah, I
manage my time well. Chen-Ying Huang: Because it’s a gp’s randomness.
Kris Haamer: Chen-Ying Huang: Okay, and you talk to the marketing person
that we’re introduce you… Kris Haamer: I think it’s working again.
Chen-Ying Huang: but it’s me that I probably will shorten this
information. And so then there is a chance to read it. there are I
believe. Kris Haamer: And the report is going to be different every
time. because Chen-Ying Huang: Probably is hard the spot. No, it’s
almost unlikely to collect that information. Kris Haamer: yes, yes.
Chen-Ying Huang: I’m thinking that there are some simple eye trackers
using the camera that you Kris Haamer: right and Chen-Ying Huang: you
can really identify what the person really reason. Kris Haamer: Sorry,
what do you mean? Kris Haamer: Yes. Yes. we have a lab at ncu. Chen-Ying
Huang: yeah. Kris Haamer: Who does that? but it’s Chen-Ying Huang: so
No,… Kris Haamer: I know people. Doing that they do it fulfillment
analysis and… Chen-Ying Huang: no, that’s not the good idea. So maybe
just don’t overload yourself. Kris Haamer: there are other people doing
it also,… Chen-Ying Huang: So maybe the one way to do is to simplify
each window so every step this person really wants to go on… Kris
Haamer: but that equipment it’s a little bit hard to book. Because a lot
of people want to use it. Chen-Ying Huang: then he had to click it and…
Kris Haamer: I feel like I’m already over my head with this project a
little bit. Chen-Ying Huang: then you just track how many clicks this
person goes through and… Kris Haamer: So I’m not sure adding another
layer. Chen-Ying Huang: this way it’s just like an easy eye tracker
instead of it’s a mouse tracker. Kris Haamer: Yeah. Yeah. Chen-Ying
Huang: So it’s a quick tracker. You can do that. Kris Haamer: Right,
right. Yes. Yes, I can do that and I’m actually doing it right now, but
I can only do that. Unfortunately on the page that I control Which is
this one,… Chen-Ying Huang: Yeah. Kris Haamer: So once they get here?
but if they get here each report has this ID here,… Chen-Ying Huang:
Dry, but you talk to the person but I think that was simplify this page.
Kris Haamer: so I’m tracking it through the ID so I know… Chen-Ying
Huang: Because I wouldn’t read it. Kris Haamer: which type of report
they got and… Chen-Ying Huang: It’s to be honest. I wouldn’t read it or…
Kris Haamer: I know which product they were looking at and… Chen-Ying
Huang: by word. Yeah, make it simpler then. Kris Haamer: things like
that, and I know that they click on this button here. But I didn’t see
anything else… Chen-Ying Huang: Probably then you will have more
influence on that. Kris Haamer: because Google Chrome just doesn’t allow
it. 00:45:00 Chen-Ying Huang: Okay, okay. Kris Haamer: Okay. Kris
Haamer: Okay. Kris Haamer: right I think that’s really a lot of help
from you. So I thank you. Chen-Ying Huang: I just try to email you and…
Kris Haamer: Thank you so much. And very nice talking to you. Chen-Ying
Huang: the two colleagues separately and then you can contact them. If
you feel that. It’s helpful and I think that you actually the talking to
the economic attrition. It should be fun, but I don’t think it’s so
necessary. It’s just justification like some economists say that we
should care less about growth. Kris Haamer: You right in a sense. I want
to just have expert kind of confirm what I have written in the thesis,…
Chen-Ying Huang: okay. Yeah. Kris Haamer: which is, mostly from the
literature and if I can have an actual person with an expert to say
similar things that I read and… Chen-Ying Huang: Yeah, he’s very nice
person. Kris Haamer: That’s useful. Chen-Ying Huang: So I think he can
help you on that. But I would really encourage you to talk to the board.
She see the large should because she is an expert in marketing. I don’t
think she should be able to help you with the design. That’s a meat so.
Kris Haamer: okay. Chen-Ying Huang: Yeah, all Right. Thank you. Kris
Haamer: That would be great. Thanks so… Chen-Ying Huang: It it’s very
impressive. Kris Haamer: Yeah, okay. Thank you. Chen-Ying Huang: Yeah, I
will be very happy my student come up with an app like this. Kris
Haamer: Thank you. Chen-Ying Huang: Yeah for What’s your all right,…
Kris Haamer: Okay. Chen-Ying Huang: okay, so I’ll email later. Bye. Kris
Haamer: Thank you so much. Okay, yeah. Bye-bye. Meeting ended after
00:48:18 👋

## Appendix 4: College Students’ Survey Data

Due to the large amounts of data captured by the initial survey (over
1600 people started the survey, after filtering, leading to over 800
Gen-Z current college students finished it fully), I’ve chosen to
exclude it from the PDF version of my thesis. The data is available upon
request - and has also been published on Hugging Face as a public
dataset here:
