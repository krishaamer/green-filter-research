In 1896, the Nobel Prize winner Svante Arrhenius first calculated how an increase in CO2 levels would have a warming effect on our global climate. 120 years later, in 2016, the Paris Agreement came into effect, with countries agreeing on non-binding climate targets. In August 2018, Greta Thunberg skipped school to start a climate strike in front of the Swedish parliament Riksdag. Millions of people joined Fridays for Future protests around the world[^1] and Time magazine named Thunberg person of the year in 2019 for *creating a global attitudinal shift*[^2]. Awareness of Earth's operating systems grew. Meanwhile, emissions kept rising. By January 2022, the Stockholm Resilience Centre reported that humanity had breached 4 out of our 9 planetary boundaries. In addition to climate change, biodiversity loss, land-system change, and biogeochemical flows. **Given these facts, what can people who want to preserve Earth's human-friendly environment, exactly do? One way to influence societal outcomes is to decide where to put our money.** Ellen MacArthur Foundation's models show 45% of CO2e emissions come from our daily shopping, produced by the companies that make the products we consume. In the US alone, the combined annual consumer spending of Millenials and Generation-Z was over $2.5T USD in 2020[^3]. Over this decade, in the US, UK, and Australia, Millennials are inheriting $30T USD from their parents. This research is concerned with how might large groups of people exclude polluting companies from their lives. Where does my money go and what are the alternatives? What is the user interface at scale, useful for billions of diverse users to make a meaningul impact? While our financial decisions are a vote towards the type of businesses we want to support, it's not enough to ***switch to green***. The study presents an AI companion design which seeks to help people build relationships with sustainable companies through purchases and investing while also **reducing consumption**. The major contribution of this study is an interactive artefact (a prototype) informed by design research.
