# Abstract

## The Journey from Consumer to Investor: Designing a Financial AI Companion for Young Adults to Help with Sustainable Shopping, Savings, and Investing

How can people shop, save & invest sustainably? Ellen MacArthur Foundation's models show 45% of CO2e emissions come from our daily shopping, produced by companies that make the products we consume[^1]. In the U.S. alone, the combined annual consumer spending of Millennials and Gen-Z was over $2.5T USD in 2020[^2]. Over the coming years, in the U.S., UK, and Australia, Millennials are inheriting $30T USD from their parents[^3]. Where does our money go and what are some greener alternatives? The study presents an AI companion design which seeks to help people build relationships with sustainable companies through group purchases and community investing while also reducing consumption. The major contribution of this study is an interactive artefact (a prototype) informed by design research.
