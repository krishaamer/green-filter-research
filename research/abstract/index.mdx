This story begins in 1896, when Nobel Prize winner Svante Arrhenius first calculated how an increase in CO2 levels would have a warming effect on our global climate. 120 years later the Paris Agreement came into effect, with countries agreeing on non-binding climate targets, which we largely have failed to meet. In August 2018, Greta Thunberg skipped school to start a climate strike in front of the Swedish parliament Riksdag. Millions of people joined her Fridays for Future[^3] protests around the world[^1] and Time magazine named Thunberg person of the year in 2019 for *creating a global attitudinal shift*[^2]. However emissions kept rising. By January 2022, the Stockholm Resilience Centre reported that humanity had already breached 4 out of our 9 planetary boundaries. In addition to climate change, biodiversity loss, land-system change, and biogeochemical flows. **Given this reality, what can people who want to preserve Earth's environment, exactly do?**

**One way to influence societal outcomes is to decide where to put our money.** 45% of CO2e emissions come from our daily shopping, produced by the companies that make the products we consume. In the U.S. alone, the combined annual consumer spending of Millenials and Generation-Z was over $2.5T USD in 2020[^4]. In the USA, UK, and Australia, Millennials are inheriting $30T USD from their parents (Turits, 2018). Our financial decisions are a vote towards the type of businesses we want to support. Given our combined power (I'm a Millennial) with Generation Z, we are willing to pay more for sustainable products [^8].

In institutional finance, the Norwegian $1.3T USD sovereign wealth fund (the world's largest, followed by China)[^5] started a divestment trend in 2016 by divesting from coal. However, their plan to reach net zero CO2e only targets 2050. Furthermore, who would be the counterpart for such large transactions? The fund also announced divesting from Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, however has yet to sell any shares citing lack of buyers on the Moscow stock market. University of California also followed suit with divestment of its $126B USD portfolio from oil and gas. Other large university endowments, such as managed by Yale, Stanford and MIT are in decision gridlock[^6]. Blackrock, the largest private investment fund in the world with $10T USD under management, released guidance reflecting their plans to shift their investments to vehicles that are measured on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance [^7]. However they later backtracked from their decision. 

**How can we make sure ESG is accessible to our everyday experience?** How might we exclude polluting companies from our lives? What is the user interface for making sustainable purchase decisions? Banks apply the principle of KYC (Know Your Customer). How could people apply the same principle (Know Your Company) when buying a product or investing? Could building an ESG community help push polluting companies towards greener practices - or starving them from cheap access to capital. It can be as mundane as choosing the next eco-friendly product instead of the polluting one we purchase in the supermarket or by investing in the growth of companies that put ESG at the center of their activities? Creating direct ties will improve ESG. A journey from consumption to investing, in line with users’ personal values, by providing relevant sustainable finance guidance.

AI assistants are an increasing trend for providing help at scale with little to no human intervention. I'm exploring the potential for using AI assistants to help everyday consumers concerned with sustainability begin a deeper relationship with the companies they are buying from and create a pathway to become investors. As interaction design research, designing a prototype artefact to help consumers make these decisions, is the major contribution of this study. 

Given these 4 trends: 
- Youth demand for sustainability
- Intergenerational money transfer to the youth 
- AI user interface availability
- ESG instruments
