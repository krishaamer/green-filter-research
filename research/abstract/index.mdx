In 1896, the Nobel Prize winner Svante Arrhenius first calculated how an increase in CO2 levels would have a warming effect on our global climate. 120 years later the Paris Agreement came into effect, with countries agreeing on non-binding climate targets, which we largely have failed to meet. In August 2018, Greta Thunberg skipped school to start a climate strike in front of the Swedish parliament Riksdag. Millions joined Fridays for Future[^3] protests around the world[^1] and Time magazine named Thunberg person of the year in 2019 for *creating a global attitudinal shift*[^2]. Meanwhile, emissions kept rising. By January 2022, the Stockholm Resilience Centre reported that humanity had already breached 4 out of our 9 planetary boundaries. In addition to climate change, biodiversity loss, land-system change, and biogeochemical flows. **Given these facts, what can people who want to preserve Earth's human-friendly environment, exactly do? One way to influence societal outcomes is to decide where to put our money.** 45% of CO2e emissions come from our daily shopping, produced by the companies that make the products we consume. In the U.S. alone, the combined annual consumer spending of Millenials and Generation-Z was over $2.5T USD in 2020[^4]. In the USA, UK, and Australia, Millennials are inheriting $30T USD from their parents (Turits, 2018). Given our combined power (I'm a Millennial) with Generation Z, we are willing to pay more for sustainable products [^8]. Our financial decisions are a vote towards the type of businesses we want to support. This research is concerned with how might we exclude polluting companies from our lives and what is the user interface for making sustainable purchase decisions? **How can we make sure ESG is accessible to our everyday experience?** AI assistants are widespread in a variety of industries. The Human-AI companion interaction design presented here seeks to help people build deeper relationships with the companies they are buying from and investing in. The major contribution of this study is an interactive artefact - a prototype designed based on interaction design research.
