# Results

## Expected Findings

-   During the preparation of this research proposal, I conducted a
    preliminary round of face-to-face interviews using 21 open-ended
    probing questions using a convenience sampling of NCKU students on
    campus between ages 19 and 29, a total of 12 respondents. The
    interviews lasted between 9 and 21 minutes and were conducted to get
    some initial feedback on my research idea, the respondents’ daily
    routines, app usage, feelings towards financial questions, including
    investing, relationship with nature, and environmental
    sustainability. These preliminary conversations led me to emphasize
    more on the financial journey, i.e., to consider the importance of
    the shopping, savings, and payments apps students already use daily,
    which could serve as an entry point to becoming an investor. I
    expect my future research findings to confirm this initial idea and
    offer diverse ways and examples of what that path could look like in
    practice.

## Survey Overview / import from Ziran {#survey-overview-import-from-ziran}

A survey of Taiwanese college students (excludes overseas
Chinese-speaking students as well as foreign students) covering
attitudes towards shopping, saving, investing, economy, nature,
sustainability, and AI.

Survey Oct. 13th - Nov. 3rd, 2023

2000 cards with a QR code printed out

Distribution conducted at 8 universities (handing out the cards)

1289 people started the survey, 518 quit

771 people completed the whole survey

Data after filtering: 675 people aged 18-26 (Gen-Z), Taiwanese, current
students in BA (large majority), MA (small minority) or PhD level (very
few respondents)

36 likert fields (5-point scale) used for clustering the students into 3
personas with K-means clustering

14 product features (multiple-choice) used for K-modes clustering

4 choice experiments

2 option ranking questions

10 text fields used to enrich the personas

### Choice Experiments

![](results_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-21-output-1.png)

## Personas from Clusters

Personas are created using K-means clustering, an unsupervised machine
learning algorithm, which clusters college students based on their
responses across 36 Likert-scale fields in the online survey. Clusters
are visualized using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), where the
principal component loadings on the X and Y axes represent the weights
of the original Likert-scale fields, transformed into the principal
components that capture the most variance.

-   There is some similarity between clusters. All 3 personas report a
    high level of financial anxiety and below-average satisfaction with
    their financial literacy.

### Clustering Students to Build 3 Personas

# Old

## Findings

-   Literature: AI assistants should integrate with Digital Product
    Passports
-   Literature: AI assistants should show carbon label data.
-   Literature: AI assistants should avoid taking ESG at face value
    (because it’s a really low bar) and integrate other metrics such as
    B Corp.
-   Literature: AI assistants should
-   Literature: Do not make another investing app, make a sustainability
    filter for excisting investing platforms.
-   Literature: College students can support extended producer
    responsibility

### RQ 1

**How might AI assistants empower regenerative shopping, saving, and
investing?**

Display the ESG, EPR, B-Corp, etc, etc credentials for each product and
investment.

EPR and B-Corp are success stories which shoul be highlighted while ESG
is largely discredited.

There are many existing and ongoing approaches to sustainability. The
best approach might be to plug into excisting system and communities and
legislation to support and empower them.

### RQ 2

**How might one design an intuitive sustainable shopping, saving,
investing app?**

Apple Watch app

### RQ 3

**What app features might college students rate as the highest
priority?**

Autopilot

### RQ 4

**How might one visualize ecological impact in digital product design?**

Accuracy is more imprttant for hhuman trust tthan actual impact

## Ideas for Interfaces

Show all the different prototypes just likes architects do. And then
defent why I chose the one I did.

For NW make a Loom with the interfaces and talk about them?
