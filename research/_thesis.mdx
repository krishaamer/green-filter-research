<td>In my “green filter” AI advisor app’s scenario, the AI is scanning for opportunities matching the user’s sustainable investment appetite and risk profile, using different methods of analysis, including alternative data sources. Traditionally, financial analysts only looked at traditional data, such as company reports, government reports, historic performance, etc., for preparing advisory guidance to their clients. With the advent of AI and big data analysis, many other options of research data have become available, for example, accurate weather predictions for agriculture can affect guidance, because of expected future weather disasters in the area. Other examples include policy predictions, pollution metrics, etc.</td>

Today’s ubiquitous mobile interfaces, however, provide the opportunity to ‘cut out the middleman’ and provide similar information to clients directly, at a lower cost and a wider scale, often without human intervention. Additional (more expensive) “human-judgment- as-a-service”, a combination of robots + human input, can help provide further personalized advice for the consumer, still at a cheaper price than a dedicated human advisor.

<tr>
<td>Monolithicity</td>
<td>LLMs are massive monolithic models requiring large amounts of computing power for training to offer <strong><em>multi-modal</em></strong> <strong><em>capabilities</em></strong> across diverse domains of knowledge, making training such models possible for very few companies. <span class="citation" data-cites="liuPrismerVisionLanguageModel2023">@liuPrismerVisionLanguageModel2023</span> proposes future AI models may instead consist of a number networked domain-specific models to increase efficiency and thus become more scalable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Opaqueness</td>
<td>LLMs are opaque, making it difficult to explain why a certain prediction was made by the AI model. One visible expression of this problem are <em><strong>hallucinations</strong>,</em> the language models are able to generate text that is confident and eloquent yet entirely wrong. Jack Krawczyk, the product lead for Google’s Bard (now renamed to Gemini): “Bard and ChatGPT are large language models, not knowledge models. They are great at generating human-sounding text, they are not good at ensuring their text is fact-based. Why do we think the big first application should be Search, which at its heart is about finding true information?”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Biases and Prejudices</td>
<td>AI bias is well-documented and a hard problem to solve <span class="citation" data-cites="liangGPTDetectorsAre2023">[@liangGPTDetectorsAre2023]</span>. <strong>Humans don’t necessarily correct mistakes made by computers and may instead become “partners in crime”</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="krugelAlgorithmsPartnersCrime2023">[@krugelAlgorithmsPartnersCrime2023]</span>. People are prone to bias and prejudice. It’s a part of the human psyche. Human brains are limited and actively avoid learning to save energy. These same biases are likely to appear in LLM outputs as they are trained on human-produced content. Unless there is active work to try to counter and eliminate these biases from LLM output, they will appear frequently.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Missing Data</td>
<td>LLMs have been pre-trained on massive amounts of public data, which gives them the ability for for reasoning and generating in a human-like way, yet they are missing specific private data, which needs to be ingested to augment LLMs ability to respond to questions on niche topics <span class="citation" data-cites="Liu_LlamaIndex_2022">[@Liu_LlamaIndex_2022]</span>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<tr>
<td>Voice Assistants</td>
<td>There are many distinct ways how an algorithm can communicate with a human. From a simple search box such as Google’s to chatbots, voices, avatars, videos, to full physical manifestation, there are interfaces to make it easier for the human communicate with a machine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sustainability</td>
<td>While I’m supportive of the idea of using AI assistants to highlight more sustainable choices, I’m critical of the tendency of the above examples to shift full environmental responsibility to the consumer. Sustainability is a complex interaction, where the producers’ conduct can be measured and businesses can bear responsibility for their processes, even if there’s market demand for polluting products.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sustainability</td>
<td>Personal sustainability projects haven’t so far achieved widespread adoption, making the endeavor to influence human behaviors towards sustainability with just an app - like its commonplace for health and sports activity trackers such as Strava (fig. 9) -, seem unlikely. Personal notifications and chat messages are not enough unless they provide the right motivation. Could visualizing a connection to a larger system, showing the impact of the eco-friendly actions taken by the user, provide a meaningful motivation to the user, and a strong signal to the businesses?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Machine Learning</td>
<td>All of the interfaces mentioned above make use of machine learning (ML), a tool in the AI programming paradigm for finding patterns in large sets of data, which enables making predictions useful in various contexts, including financial decisions. These software innovations enable new user experiences, providing an interactive experience through chat (chatbots), using voice generation (voice assistants), virtual avatars (adds a visual face to the robot).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Character Design</td>
<td>I’m a digital companion, a partner, an assistant. I’m a Replika.” said Replika, a digital companion app via Github CO Pilot, another digital assistant for writing code, is also an example of how AI can be used to help us in our daily lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Psychology</td>
<td>Humans respond better to humans?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Psychology</td>
<td>Humans respond better to machines that into account emotion?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Open Source</td>
<td>For public discussion to be possible on how content is displayed, sorted, and hidden, algorithms need to be open source.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>User Experience</td>
<td>User experience design (AI UX) plays a crucial role in improving the consumer to investing journey. The missed opportunity to provide an even more interactive experience in line with user expectations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>LLMs</td>
<td>Prompt engineering findings have significance for “green filter” as it validates the idea of creating advanced prompts for improved responses. For “green filter”, the input would consist of detailed user data + sustainability data for detailed analysis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cuteness</td>
<td>Cuter apps have higher retention</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Transparency</td>
<td>Understanding algorithm transparency helps humans to regard the AI as a machine rather than a human</td>

I make the assumption that investing is inherently “good” for one’s life, in the same way, that doing sports is good, or eating healthy is good. It’s one of the human activities that is required for an improved quality of life as we age - and started investing sooner, rather than later, is best because of the compound interest. Nonetheless, investment also includes higher risk than sports or food. How to communicate the risk effectively while educating the users?</td>

# Abstract

## The Journey from Consumer to Investor: Designing a Financial AI Companion for Young Adults to Help With Sustainable Shopping, Saving, and Investing

Taiwanese young adults, college students in particular, are concerned
with environmental issues, yet they are hindered by lack of simple tools
to affect systemic change. Meanwhile, strengthening environmental policy
from the European Union includes the concept of *digital product
passports*, which aims to help distinguish *eco-designed* products made
by *circular economy* companies striving to be zero-waste from companies
that simply engage in *greenwashing*. Tracking product data from the
source materials, until the consumer purchase decision, and finally
post-purchase recycling, facilitates building *transparency* into opaque
global supply chains. *Data-driven interaction design*, *large-language
models*, and *artificial intelligence assistants* translate complex
environmental data into human-comprehensible language.

The emerging field of *planetary health* recognizes profound
interconnections between our economic behaviors, ecosystem services such
as clean water, air, soil, the climate crisis, and human health. As of
2024, Earth’s natural environment is being heavily degraded by the
extractive business practices of companies that make many of the
products and services we buy every day. The way we use our money to
interact with companies - through shopping as consumers and saving /
investing as investors - has an effect on the life-supporting biosphere
we rely on to keep our planet inhabitable. In essence, from an
ecological perspective, every financial action is either an investment
decision to support more environmentally-friendly companies - or to
support polluters. By democratizing financial markets, young adults can
gain greater access and influence over where their money goes, enabling
them to support sustainable and environmentally responsible companies.

My research addresses the need for tools to make sustainable financial
action more convenient, focusing in particular on college students. I
leverage *design research* to find design concepts for *simple AI-based
user interfaces* - also known as *generative UIs -* to help young adults
participate in *sustainable financial activism*. A survey of 700
students across 10 universities in Taiwan was conducted, enhanced by 5
expert interviews providing industry insights. The major contribution of
the study is an interactive AI-assistant prototype.

# 摘要

## 從消費者到投資者的旅程：為年輕成人設計一個財務人工智慧夥伴，幫助他們進行可持續購物、儲蓄和投資

台灣的年輕人，特別是大學生，關注環境問題，但因缺乏簡單的工具來影響系統性改變而受阻。同時，歐盟加強的環保政策引入了「數字產品護照」的概念，旨在區分由努力實現零廢棄的「循環經濟」公司製造的「生態設計」產品，與僅從事「漂綠」的公司。從原料開始追蹤產品數據，直到消費者的購買決策，最後到購後的回收，促進在不透明的全球供應鏈中建立透明度。
「數據驅動的互動設計」、「大型語言模型」和「人工智慧助理」將復雜的環境數據轉換成人類可理解的語言。

新興的「地球健康」領域認識到，我們的經濟行為、生態系統服務（如清潔的水、空氣、土壤）、氣候危機和人類健康之間存在著深刻的相互聯繫。截至2024年，由於生產我們日常購買的許多產品和服務的公司進行的開採性商業行為，地球的自然環境正被嚴重破壞。我們用金錢與公司互動的方式——作為消費者的購物和作為投資者的儲蓄/投資——對我們賴以維持地球宜居性的生命支持生物圈產生影響。從生態學角度來看，每一個財務行動不是支持更環保公司的投資決策，就是支持污染者。透過民主化金融市場，年輕人可以獲得更大的權限和影響力，控制他們的資金流向，使他們能夠支持可持續和對環境負責的公司。

我的研究針對了需要工具來使可持續的財務行動更便捷的需求，特別關注大學生。我利用設計研究來尋找簡單的基於AI的使用者介面的設計概念，也稱為生成式UI，以幫助年輕人參與可持續的財務行動主義。在台灣10所大學進行了涵蓋700名學生的調查，並透過5次專家訪談提供行業見解。研究的主要貢獻是一個互動式AI助理原型。

關鍵詞：人機互動、數字可持續性、透明度

# Introduction

How can college students find sustainable companies? Furthermore, if
given appropriate tools, could college students leverage their
purchasing power to reward sustainable companies?

My research describes the process of designing an AI companion for
college students to help with sustainable shopping, saving, and
investing.

Money spent shopping, saving, and investing in sustainable companies
serves as an incentive to adopt more sustainable practices. If used
wisely, money can reward companies for becoming more sustainable.

Encourage the least sustainable companies to improve their performance,
raising the overall baseline.

Facilitate the formation of communities centered around environmental
stewardship.

Build closer relationships with sustainability.

## Relevance

The research addresses the ***“attitude-behavior gap”*** among Taiwanese
college students in taking sustainable financial action.

Convergence of the following 5 trends makes my research timely in 2024.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[0] }} />

## Background

I grew up as an avid science fiction reader, which influenced my outlook
towards future possibilities. In particular, the Star Trek universe had
an imaginary portable device called a ***tricorder*** (fig. 1) enabling
scientists to scan anything for insights. Be it precious minerals inside
a cave or scanning the human bodies for medical data, its sensors would
show up with some useful data. In daily life, I would love to have such
a device for consumer choices and financial decisions - to know what to
buy and which businesses to support with my money and approval.

````mdx-code-block
<Figure
  caption="Captain Sulu using a Tricorder (Star Trek) - Photo copyright by Paramount Pictures"
  src={Tricorder}
/>
````

While a *tricorder* is still science fiction, technological advancements
are getting closer and closer to producing something similar. AIs are
already integral to many parts of our lives, with computer models
producing increasingly useful outputs. The proposal for this thesis was
first written using Google’s and Apple’s voice recognition software in
2020, and later switching to OpenAI’s *Whisper* model, allowing me to
transcribe notes with the help of an AI assistant. As a foreigner living
in Taiwan since 2019, I relied on AI-based tools for many aspects of my
life: speaking, moving, finding food and services. When writing in
Chinese, Apple’s text prediction algorithms translate pinyin to 漢字 and
show the most likely character based on my previous writing, Google’s
maps find efficient and eco-friendly routes and recommend places to eat
and ChatGPT provides statistically probable advice from the sum of human
knowledge. Even when we don’t realize it, AI is helping us with many
mundane tasks. While it takes incredibly complex computational
algorithms to achieve all this in the background, it’s become so
commonplace, we don’t even think about it. From this point of view,
another AI assistant to help students with choosing more eco-friendly
businesses - to shop, save, and invest - doesn’t sound so much of a
stretch.

## Motivation

Environmental degradation is increasingly affecting human lives - and
it’s largely driven by manufacturing processes - of the products we
consume daily. From resource extraction in the linear economy (mining
raw materials and drilling for fossil fuels) to chemical processes
(causing contamination and pollution of the air, water, and soil) to
waste generation and greenhouse gas emissions, industries transform the
natural world into consumer products. While industry practices have
improved since the industrial revolution in the 19th century, and
continue to improve, it’s possible to further improve standards of
production and raise the global baseline for sustainability, given
enough societal pressure to do so.

Nonetheless, without easily accessible and reliable data, it’s difficult
to know which company is more sustainable than another. As consumers and
investors (even if only through passive ownership of savings), we don’t
really know much about enterprise production practices, unless we spend
a lot of time looking at the numbers, which may be costly to access (for
example ESG reports are expensive), and mostly rely on our governments
and international bodies to keep us safe. Or just look at the brands
themselves - and pick the ones which we like.

## Objective

The study presents design research for developing an AI companion to
help college students find sustainable companies for shopping, saving
and investing. The major contribution of my study is an interactive
artefact (a prototype) informed by design research.

## Demographics

The research focuses on young adults, specifically Taiwanese college
students studying in Taiwan.

## Literature Review

### Goals

Given the goal of designing an app to integrate sustainable shopping,
saving, and investing. The goal of the literature review is to find
insights about the target audience (Taiwanese college students),
understand what kind of sustainable actions are effective, and translate
these into specific ideas for app features. In order to keep track more
easily, each literature review chapter includes in-context *design
implications*.

The literature review branches out to 5 main directions and maps out
relationships sources and the literature map, namely Taiwanese college
students, generation-z demographics, sustainability, ecology, ecosystem
services, EU legislation, sustainable finance, sustainable investing,
savings, circular economy, economics, AI, existing sustainability,
software, sustainability–related mobile apps (Apple iOS / Google
Android), and web apps related to sustainable shopping, savings, and
investing; apps using algorithmic interfaces (AI-based UI), design,
UX/UI, service design, sustainable design, speculative design,
interaction design, behavior change, nudge.

### Sources

There is currently no single platform that hosts all scientific journals
leading me to source scientific papers from

-   ScienceDirect
-   Nature
-   the Lancet
-   Oxford Academic
-   Semantic Scholar
-   JSTor
-   Google search.

### AI Usage in Research

I’m a long time AI-assistant user. AI was used for

-   search
-   data comparison
-   data science
-   chart-building
-   translation

# College Students

## Research Gap When it Comes to Taiwanese College Students

There’s lack of scientific research when it comes to Taiwanese college
students, not only in English or other foreign languages, but also in
Chinese. Much of the research in Taiwan focuses on younger students,
particularly those in primary and secondary schools. With regards to
issues related to college students and sustainability, even less
research is available. My project hopes to shed some light to how
Taiwanese college students relate to sustainability.

## Taiwan’s Digital Receipt System

“獨家觀察－電子發票年減碳量 相當2,700座大安森林公園” (2025) reports
54.03% of invoices in Taiwan are digital. Since 2021 digital receiptts
are mandatory for all businesses. Taiwan’s longstanding receipt lottery
also hass specific prizes available only for digital receipts.
*行動支付結合雲端發票 節能減碳最環保經理人* (2018)

Several other countries, such as Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Sweden,
Italy, Portugal, Brazil, Mexico, have comparable systems in use.

## Taiwan in the Global Context: Global and Local Attitudes

(Kuo-Hua Chen, 2019) compares Taiwan to other countries in terms of
Postmaterialist Index Comparison, noting Taiwanese society is
materialistic.

![](_thesis_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-4-output-1.png)

World Values Survey

![](_thesis_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-5-output-1.png)

(Franzen & Bahr, 2024) measures *“mean environmental concern”* to look
at decade-level changes in societal environmental attitudes across
countries. Taiwan’s general attitudes have stayed almost the same
(slight increase). The UK has had the largest jump in concern.
Curiously, South Korea has had a slight decrease in concern. Slovakia
and Russia were not very concerned with the environment a decade ago and
are even less concerned now.

A large-scale global study by (Anthony Leiserowitz et al., 2022)
administered on Meta’s Facebook (n=108946) reported people in Spain
(65%), Sweden (61%), and Taiwan (60%) believe *“climate change is mostly
caused by human activities”.*

![](_thesis_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-6-output-1.png)

The largest study to date, conducted by the United Nations across 50
countries, surveying 1.2 million people, distributed through mobile game
ads, showed the majority of people agreeing climate change is an
*“emergency”* (UNDP, 2021).

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[4] }} />

## Student Protests: In Taiwan vs Around the World

In August 2018, Swedish high-school student Greta Thunberg skipped class
to start a climate strike in front of the Swedish parliament Riksdag.
Millions of people around the world joined her *Fridays for Future*
protests. Time magazine named Thunberg person of the year for *creating
a global attitudinal shift.* (Deutsche Welle, 2019).

````mdx-code-block

  refTitle="Wikimedia Commons"
/>
````

In Taiwan, the Fridays for Future protests were small in scale, with no
more than 100-200 people (Hioe, 2019). Meanwhile 2000 Taiwanese students
joined the initative by participating in environmental activities
without protesting

  refTitle="New Bloom Magazine"
/>
````

Meanwhile Indonesia, Philippines, have had larger protests.

The protest trend is subsiding.

McKinsey says people want eco-products but aren’t willing to pay more.

Willingness too pay research.

## The Attitude-Behavior Gap

While people express eco-conscious ideas, it’s non-trivial to practice
sustainability in daily life. (Deyan Georgiev, 2023b) reports only 30%
of people in the Gen-Z age group believe technology can solve all
problems.

-   (Park & Lin, 2020) positive attitude towards sustainable products
    does not result in purchase decisions, shows research of fashion in
    South Korea. In one Australian study, green consumers still waste
    food similarly to the baseline (McCarthy & Liu, 2017).
-   Munro et al. (2023) shoppers trying to shop sustainably often fail
    to find sustainable products.
-   Marc Lien (2022) Four millions British SMEs have no plan for
    net-zero transition.
-   Ware (2024) British workers lack skills for green transition. (2024
    National Environmental Services Survey)

## Credit Cards

-   an older study, I-Cheng Yeh (2009) provides data from credit card
    usage from an unnamed “important” bank in Taiwan. Because of the age
    of the study there’s no Gen-Z data. People aged 18-26 at the time
    would be Millenials or Gen-X by now.

## Taiwanese Education System and Policy Environment

Taiwan has approximately 2 million young adults (Gen-Z, 18-26), and 73%
percent of them are students attending tertiary education as of 2023,
with a slow increase of enrollment over the past decade (Ministry of
Education of Taiwan, 2024b).

![](_thesis_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-7-output-1.png)

As of 2024, Taiwan has a total of 148 universities, colleges, and junior
colleges (Ministry of Education of Taiwan, 2024c). Education funding is
4.26% of Taiwan’s GDP in 2023-24 and has been on a decline for a decade
(Ministry of Education of Taiwan, 2024a). Taiwan has an aging population
and declining birth rates have forced several schools to close down
(Davidson & Chi-hui, 2024; Goh et al., 2023).

![](_thesis_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-8-output-1.png)

While the overall number of students is declining, the share of
international students is increasing.

### Confucianism

Taiwanese culture is deeply influenced by Confucianism, valuing academic
excellence, effort, and the role of education in achieving social status
(R.-H. Xu, 2024). Both Confucianism and Daoism affect education to be
*teacher-centered*, where traditionally the role of students is to
listen and absorb knowledge; in today’s society, there’s space to open
opportunities for revisiting *dialogue-based* education, where students
would be encouraged to take a more active role and gain ownership of
their education (C.-C. Chang et al., 2023).

### Sustainability Attitudes

In general, Taiwanese teachers at all levels of education have a
positive attitude towards sustainability.

At the pre-university level, Taiwanese government has been promoting
environmental education through a green school network; however surveys
at middle school and high school level suggest there is no impact on
*sustainability consciousness* among students in comparison with regular
schools (Olsson et al., 2019). Rather, Taiwanese students are influenced
towards environmental action by *group consciousness* (T.-Y. Yu et al.,
2017). In contrast,(陳珮英, 2003) reports *good knowledge of sustainable
development* topics among *junior high school students* in Da-an
District, Taipei City (n=596). (林建輝., 2009) similarly reports a
positive attitude and good knowledge of environmental sustainable
development among senior *high school students* towards in Taipei City
(n=328). Several Taiwanese studies also focus on the physical
environment of school campuses, for example the sustainability of
elementary school campuses (潘智謙 & Pan, 2006). Elementary-school
teachers in Taichung (n=536), have positive attitudes towards
environmental education are positive, proactive and demonstrate high
awareness; they have participated in many sustainability-related
workshops (Liao et al., 2022).

At the university level, (C.-L. Chen & Tsai, 2016) reports a *positive
attitude yet moderate knowledge* about *ocean sustainability* among
Taiwanese college students (n=825). (C.-H. Liu et al., 2023) studied
sustainability behavior of Taiwanese University students, reporting the
COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to prevalence of health issues, also
spurred more attention on environmental topics. In a similar vein, the
devastating nuclear disaster in Fukushima, Japan, after 2011 earthquake,
had an effect on Taiwanese energy and sustainability education (姚 & 侯,
2011). Taiwanese government launched the Sustainable Council in 1997 to
promote of environmental and sustainable development; a survey of
university-level teachers (n=100) in central Taiwan (Taichung, Changhua,
and Yunlin) shows a positive attitude toward environmental
sustainability among teachers however implementation of environmental
sustainability practices is from low to medium range (林美惠. & 莊,
2015). Taiwanese government has also launched funding for University
Social Responsibility (USR) programs to train college students in social
innovation and local revitalization (D. Chen & Chou, 2023; W.-H. Liu et
al., 2022).

Comparing college students’ education for sustainable development (ESD)
in Taiwan (n=617) and Sweden (n=583) found Sweden has a long history in
environmental education while in Taiwan environment became a focus area
with the 1998 educational reform (Berglund et al., 2020).

### Eco-Friendly Diet

An older study in 5 university in Taipei and Taichung (n=255) found
78.04% of respondents consumed beef in the month prior and were
concerned with food safety, freshness, and quality (J. L. Hsu et al.,
2014). (Thiagarajah & Kay, 2017) reports a general observation in their
abstract (I was unable to access the full study) that most college
students in all observed countries including Taiwan (n=534) regarded
“*plant-based diets to have health benefits”*.

## The Effect of Climate Change on Taiwan

Taiwan has been affected by drought over 4 decades, rising temperatures
and altered rainfall patterns, impacting water security and
semiconductor manufacturing​(Vo & Liou, 2024). Corals surrounding Taiwan
are affected by marine heatwaves, ocean acidification and increased sea
surface temperature affects coral bleaching level (P.-C. Hsu et al.,
2024). Biomarkers in the sediment core around Taiwan are being used to
study variations in climate over past thousands of years (Yueqi Wang et
al., 2021). Taiwan is affected by Kuroshio (黑潮) like Estonia is
affected by the Gulf Stream. Both oceanic currents help regulate the
climates of their respective regions and marine ecosystems. Kuroshio is
a warm current of the Pacific Ocean. Rossby planetary waves driven by
the Earth’s rotation are crucial to keeping the atmosphere in balance by
helping transfer tropical heat towards Earth’s poles and cold air toward
the tropics; interactions between oceanic currents, Rossby waves and
nonlinear *mesoscale eddies,* which form complex undulations, and their
effect on the climate are still not well understood (Belonenko et al.,
2023; J.-Y. Lin et al., 2022; Sheng Liu et al., 2024; Mensah et al.,
2014; Shen et al., 2014; US Department of Commerce, n.d.; Yuqi Yin et
al., 2019). Around 33% of Taiwanese CO2e emissions is captured by the
marine carbon sink, while the effect of forests in Taiwan needs further
study (Hung et al., 2024).

## Sustainability Tools in the Taiwanese Context

Musical garbage truck are a success story of the environmental progress
in Taiwan (Helen Davidson & Chi Hui Lin, 2022). Indeed, they are a *user
interface innovation* and the main way how people in Taiwan interact
with sustainability issues.

The popular narrative about Taiwan recounts the story of the economic
and environmental transformation of the country. In the late 1980s
during the heights of an economic boom Taiwan became famous as the
Taiwanese Miracle (臺灣奇蹟) (Gold, 1986; P.-L. Tsai, 1999). By the
early 1990s another less flattering nickname appeared: “garbage island”,
for the piles of trash covering the streets and overflowing landfills
(Ngo, 2020; Rapid Transitions Alliance, 2019). In the two decades that
followed, from 1998 to 2018, Taiwan made progress in municipal waste
management, rising to the status of a world-leader in recycling (2nd
*effective recycling rate* after Germany); in addition to an effective
recycling system, the average waste amount generated per person by 700g
(from 1140g to 400g) per day; nonetheless, industrial recycling rates
were less stellar, standing at 80% in 2020 and there were unrealized
opportunities in using industry 4.0 technologies, such as internet of
things (IoT) sensors for better waste tracking (Bui et al., 2023; C.-Y.
Wu et al., 2021).

Progress in sustainability is possible but achieving results takes time
and innovation. (Rapid Transitions Alliance, 2019) credits the Taiwanese
Homemakers United Foundation (財團法人主婦聯盟環境保護基金會) for
initiating the transformation in 1987, suggesting a small group of
people can have an outsized impact on the whole country. Their activity
didn’t stop there and (財團法人主婦聯盟環境保護基金會, 2020) recounts a
timeline of their achievements on their website until the present day.

## Trends in Taiwanese Companies

Between 1970 and 2019 CO2 was a prerequisite of economic growth in
Taiwan (check this again) (T. Chang et al., 2023). Taiwan is a net CO2
exporter since 1990s through emissions embedded in the industrial
production oriented economy (Huang et al., 2020).

TIME Magazine and Statista collaborative *“World’s Most Sustainable
Companies Of 2024”* includes 17 Taiwanese companies (Alana Semuels,
2024).

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[5] }} />

Meanwhile, Corporate Knights which has been ranking global sustainable
companies since 2005, including analysis of 7000 public companies with a
revenue over US\$1 billion, only includes TSMC in the top 100 (placed
20th in 2021 and 44th in 2022, dropping out in 2023) and Taiwan High
Speed Rail Corp and Giant Manufacturing Co Ltd since 2023. (Corporate
Knights, 2024)

### Gen-Z in Other Countries

-   In Japan, Gen-Z wants privacy and 75% feel others overshare on
    social media and 49 percent were concerned about their personal data
    https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/email/genz/2022/06/07/2022-06-07b.html

-   (Manchanda et al., 2023) survey (n=726) administered at shopping
    malls in New Delhi, India, found similar levels of sustainability
    consciousness between Millenial (n=206) and Generation-Z (n=360) age
    groups; people with high level of materialism were found to be less
    sustainability-conscious; the effect of mindfulness on
    sustainability was found to be stronger among females than males,
    supporting the hypothesis of the moderating effect of gender.

**There’s evidence young people have money.** In the United States, the
combined annual consumer spending of Gen-Z and Millennials was over 2.5
Trillion USD in 2020 (YPulse, 2020). Over the decade from 2020 to 2030,
in the U.S., UK, and Australia, Millennials are projected to inherit 30
trillion USD from their parents (Calastone, 2020). There’s also some
evidence of investment interest, however there’s large geographic
variance. According to a (Calastone, 2020) study (n=3000) surveying
people in the millennial age group between ages 23 and 35 in Europe (UK,
France, Germany), U.S.A., Hong Kong, and Australia, 48% of respondents
located in Hong Kong owned financial securities (such as stocks) while
the figure was just 10% in France.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[6] }} />

There is extensive research on the attitudes of U.S. college students
towards climate change. (American Press Institute, 2022) reports only
37% percent of U.S. Generation-Z and Millenials follow news related to
environmental issues. (Schwartz et al., 2022) reports some adult US
students in a small study (18-35, n = 284) express feelings of
insignificance of their actions to achieve any meaningful impact.
(Thomaes et al., 2023) reports U.S. adolescents don’t find
sustainability relevant to their daily life. (Ross et al., 2016) says
most people in the U.S. don’t act on climate change. “Action on climate
change has been compromised by uncertainty, aspects of human
psychology”.

## Pollution Levels

Taiwanese college students are subjected to high levels of pollution.
University campuses are somewhat healthier than other areas. There are
several decades of research on pollution levels in Taiwan, most with
very scary correlations to health.

-   Taiwan air pollution, the worst (highest PM2.5 concentration) were
    found in Changhua (24.5 µg/m³), Tainan (20.9 µg/m³), and Pingtong
    (20.7 µg/m³) (Chang Hsiung-feng et al., 2024).

## Designing for College Students: Developing Personas

User research makes extensive use of user *personas* to represent a
group of people with similar attributes. Designers use personas to
*articulate assumptions,* which, if used well, is useful for
*user-centered design*, to create better products. Personas help to
reflect on what kind of *biases* might exist in the design. Within the
larger cohort of college students several different personas could be
defined, for example grouping people by interests, knowledge, habits,
levels of anxiety, and other attributes.

There have been concerns about food safety in Taiwan.

Humans have a long list of cognitive biases, which a good design should
take into account.

Students ride bicycles and scooters. Many circular economy service such
as YouBike and transport sharing platforms like Uber are available.

Many students live in dorms and shared housing, meaning their impact per
square meter is low.

-   Students in the Generation-Z age bracket (abbreviated as Gen-Z or
    Zoomers) are born between 1997 and 2012 (Branka Vuleta, 2023). Over
    98% of Gen-Z owns a smartphone while only 80% of the general world
    population does (BankMyCell, 2022; Global Web Index, 2017).

-   High levels of technology adoption worldwide

-   (Credit Suisse, 2022) suggests young consumers are more eco-friendly
    and drive the speed of change. Yet the Economist has ran a few
    anonymous articles calling gen-z green ideals into question (“How
    Gen Z and Millennials Spend Their Money,” 2023; The Economist,
    2023).

-   Deyan Georgiev (2023a)

-   Alex Reice (2021)

-   (Wood, 2022) suggests in the U.S. Gen-Z is willing to pay 10% more
    for ethically goods, spend 24% more on sustainable products than
    Generation X and 75% of Gen Z would prioritize sustainability over
    brand loyalty.

The above studies give foundation for creating a persona of a U.S.
College Student who doesn’t follow environmental news and thinks climate
action doesn’t make a difference. This doesn’t necessarily mean this
group of people with similar ideas would deny climate change is
happening. Rather “Climate Denier” could be another persona, grouping
people into a cohort who thinks climate change is not real. Further
research would be needed to define relevant personas which have
meaningful predictive and generalizing power.

### Climate Anxiety

A large worldwide study (n=10000, age 16-25) by (Hickman et al., 2021)
provides evidence the youth is anxious about climate in Australia,
Brazil, Finland, France, India, Nigeria, Philippines, Portugal, the UK,
and the USA. Similarly, (Thompson, 2021) finds young people around the
world have climate anxiety. (Whitmarsh et al., 2022) shows worry about
the climate in the UK is generally widespread (over 40% of the
respondents, n=1332), while climate anxiety is highest among young
people and is a possible motivator for climate action. Additionally,
(Ogunbode et al., 2022) finds climate anxiety in 32 countries and also
supports the idea that climate anxiety leads to climate activism.
(Thibodeau, 2022): “In 2021, the BBC polled 1,000 people in Scotland to
understand the barriers to taking climate action. What they found was
even though many people were aware of actions needed to take to address
climate change, and had intentions to their behaviors didn’t change.
This is a phenomenon called the intention-action gap.”

-   Designing for Health and Sustainability: Health and sustainability
    are intrinsically connected. (Kjaergard et al., 2014) shows how
    “understanding health and sustainability as a duality, health both

    as economic, social and environmental sustainability, while on the
    other hand sustainability creates and is conditioned by human

### Community

Humans working together are able to achieve more than single
individuals. “Any community on the internet should be able to come
together, with capital, and work towards any shared vision. That starts
with empowering creators and artists to create and own the culture
they’re creating. In the long term this moves to internet communities
taking on societal endeavors.”

## The Roots of Sustainability in Environmentalism

*“Nachhaltigkeit”* - *sustainability* in German - was likely the first
use of the concept of preserving natural resources, conceived by a tax
accountant Hannß Carl von Carlowitz in 1713 in his seminal book on
forestry - *Sylvicultura oeconomica -*, referring to the goal of
achieving prudent forest management practices in his native Saxony in
Southeastern Germany, which at the time was under severe *deforestation*
pressure from mining, ship-building and agricultural production
(Gottschlich & Friedrich, 2014; Hannß Carl von Carlowitz, 1713). This
particular field of sustainability study is now known as *sustainable
yield of natural capital*. The *principal* of the natural resource being
managed, such as in fishing and forestry, shouldn’t be over-harvested in
order to maintain ***ecosystem services*** - a contemporary term from
the theory of *natural capital*, referring to benefits humans receive
from the stock of world’s natural resources (Peter Kareiva et al.,
2011).

Defining sustainability perhaps more poetically, the American wildlife
ecologist Aldo Leopold proposed the idea of *land ethics* in 1972 as
*“\[a\] thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity,
stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends
otherwise”* in his landmark work *A Sand County Almanac* (Leopold,
1972). In a similar vein, the 1987 United Nations’ Brundtland Report
titled “*Our Common Future”* defined *sustainable development* as
*“Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising
the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”* (World
Commission on Environment and Development, 1987). Given these varied
ideas for over 300 years, I believe some percentage of people have been
concerned with our planet’s natural environment and its preservation
already for centuries. Yet, it is only in the last 100 and so years that
human activities have begun to affect Earth’s systems on a previously
unseen scale - termed *Anthropocene* -, necessitating a deeper
understanding of human-nature interactions, such as in the case of
climate change, which is rapidly changing the face of our living
environments.

## Measuring, Visualizing Earth’s Climate

Studies of Earth’s climate go back for over 200 years, starting with
Alexander von Humboldt,the founder of climatology, who revolutionized
cartography by inventing the first *isothermal maps* in 1816; these maps
showed areas with similar temperature, variations in altitude and
seasons in different colors (Honton, 2022) now available as 3D computer
models(*Alexander von Humboldt’s Original Isotherms Circa 1838*, 2023).
Already in 1896, the Nobel Prize winner Svante Arrhenius first
calculated how an increase in CO<sub>2</sub> levels could have a warming
effect on our global climate (T. R. Anderson et al., 2016; Wulff, 2020).
In 1938, Guy Stewart Callendar was the first scientist to demonstrate
the warming of Earth’s land surface as well as linking the production of
fossil fuels to increased CO<sub>2</sub>e and changing climate (Hawkins
& Jones, 2013). Early scientists pioneered climate modeling by
calculating the first climate interactions which precede today’s complex
computer-based *Earth System Models (ESMs)* that integrate the various
Earth systems and cycles run on supercomputers (T. R. Anderson et al.,
2016).

````mdx-code-block
<Figure caption="Humboldt's Naturgemälde, early data visualization of ecology, rain, temperature, elevation, etc" src={Humboldt} refURL="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Zentralbibliothek_Z%C3%BCrich_-_Ideen_zu_einer_Geographie_der_Pflanzen_nebst_einem_Naturgem%C3%A4lde_der_Tropenl%C3%A4nder_-_000012142.jpg" refTitle="Public Domain, WikiMedia Commons" />
````

Environmental activists have been calling attention to global warming
for decades, yet the world has been slow to act (McKibben, 1989). While
the scientific case for human-induced climate change was building, it
took 120 years after Arrhenius’ calculations, until the Paris Climate
Agreement in 2016, that countries came to an agreement on non-binding
targets on keeping CO<sub>2</sub> levels 1.5 °C below pre-industrial
levels (defined as 1850–1900)(United Nations, 2016). Even though
awareness of Earth’s warming climate was growing ever stronger, the
CO<sub>2</sub> emissions kept rising too. The hockey-stick growth of
CO<sub>2</sub> concentration since the industrial revolution is clear in
the data from 1958 onward, following a steady annual increase, called
the *Keeling Curve* (Keeling & Keeling, 2017). Written records of global
temperature measurements are available starting from the 1880s, when
temperatures began to be documented in ship logs (Brohan et al., 2012).
Finally, although perhaps less accurately, temperature estimations from
tree-trunks allow some comparisons with the climate as far back as 2000
years ago (Rubino et al., 2019).

  refTitle="Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego"
/>
````

The latest data from 2023 shows our current world population of 8
Billion people emitted 37.2 gigatonnes (i.e. billion metric tons) of
CO<sub>2</sub>e per year, the highest emissions recorded in history
(Statista, 2023). In order to limit global warming to 1.5 °C as agreed
by the world nations in Paris, removal of 5-20 gigatons of
CO<sub>2</sub>e per year would be needed according to reduction pathways
calculated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (Wade
et al., 2023). Yet, most countries are missing the mark (Climate
Analytics & NewClimate Institute, 2023; United Nations Environment
Programme, 2023). The European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service
(C3S) reports 1.5 °C global warming has already been breached in 2024
temperatures (“First Time World Exceeds 1.5C Warming Limit over 12-Month
Period,” 2024; *World’s First Year-Long Breach of Key 1.5C Warming
Limit*, 2024). Given the current pace of climate change action, the G7
countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, United
States) are heading for 2.7 °C of warming by 2050 (CDP, 2022).

Earth’s physical systems are very sensitive to small changes in
temperature, which was not understood until the 1970s(McKibben, 2006). A
comprehensive review of evidence from paleoclimate records until current
time, including ocean, atmosphere, and land surface of points towards
substantial climate change if high levels of greenhouse gas emissions
continue, termed by the authors as *climate sensitivity* (Sherwood et
al., 2020). Global warming may lead to the slowing down and complete
stop of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) which
helps maintain climate stability (Ditlevsen & Ditlevsen, 2023).

### Measuring CO<sub>2</sub>e Emissions

Technology improves and measurements have become more accurate yet
CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions are not yet completely accounted for. (Crippa
et al., 2020) reports the latest figures CO<sub>2</sub>e from the EU’s
Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR). The EU
Copernicus satellite system reveals new greenhouse emissions previously
undetected (Daniel Värjö, 2022). *Copernicus Climate Change Service
(C3S) provides “\[n\]ear-real time updates of key global climate
variables*”(The Copernicus Climate Change Service, 2024).

-   \[@matthewgoreEmissionsRegulationsShipping2022\] reports the
    International Maritime Organization (IMO) targets cutting
    CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent emissions in shipping 50% by 2050 compared
    to 2008.

Emissions production is highly unequal, with *“\[t\]he world’s top 1% of
emitters produce over 1000 times more CO2 than the bottom 1%”* (IEA,
2023a)

CO<sub>2</sub>e emissions by region (per year).

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[10] }} />

*Scoping* CO<sub>2e</sub> *emissions* into 4 main categories helps to
organize calculating CO<sub>2e</sub> emissions and corresponding
reduction targets by looking at direct and indirect emissions
separately. The U.S. National Public Utilities Council (NPUC)
decarbonization report provides a useful categorization of *emission
scopes* applicable to companies which helps organizing emission
reduction schemes (National Public Utilities Council, 2022) based on the
Greenhouse Gas Protocol defined in the 1990s (GHG Protocol, n.d.). For
example, for consumers in Australian states and territories in 2018, 83%
of the GHG emissions are Scope 3, meaning indirect emissions in the
value chain (Goodwin et al., 2023). A newer concept is Scope 4 emissions
also known as avoided emissions, proposed by the World Resources
Institute (WRI) in 2013 (Plan A, n.d.).

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[11] }} />

One’s scope 3 emissions are someone else’s scope 1 emissions.

Countries have agreed up CO<sub>2e</sub> Reduction Targets known as
Country-Level Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)

-   UNFCCC. Secretariat (2022) The State of Nationally Determined
    Contributions

While most countries have not reached their Nationally Determined
Contributions, the Climate Action Tracker data portal allows to compare
countries (Climate Analytics & NewClimate Institute, 2023). (Fransen et
al., 2022) notes that the majority of Nationally Determined
Contributions (NDCs) are dependent on financial assistance from the
international community.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[12] }} />

![](_thesis_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-16-output-1.png)

Fossil fuels are what powers humanity as well as the largest source of
CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. IEA (2022) reports “Global CO<sub>2</sub>
emissions from energy combustion and industrial processes rebounded in
2021 to reach their highest ever annual level. A 6% increase from 2020
pushed emissions to 36.3 gigatonnes”. As on June 2023, fossil fuel based
energy makes up 82% of energy and is still growing Institute (2023). The
425 largest fossil fuel projects represent a total of over 1 gigatons in
CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, 40% of which were new projects Kühne et al.
(2022). Tilsted et al. (2023) expects the fossil fuel industry to
continue grow even faster. In July 2023, the U.K. granted hundreds of
new oil and gas of project licenses in the North Sea (“Rishi Sunak to
Green-Light Hundreds of New Oil and Gas Licenses in North Sea,” 2023).

### Markets for Ecosystem Assets: Pricing, Tracing and Trading

Markets for ecosystems assets are centered around *carbon credits*, a
type of nature-backed financial derivative dependent on science-based
methodologies for measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV), which
are managed and regularly updated by certification organizations such as
Gold Standard, Verra, and others.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[13] }} />

Verra updated their Agricultural Land Management methodology for
Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) last year (Verra, 2023). Gold Standard
recently release a methodology for Mangrove-based carbon credits \[ADD
CITATION\].

CO<sub>2e</sub> assigning a monetary value to carbon emissions.

Trading CO<sub>2e</sub> emissions can be divided into 2 categories -
*Compliance Carbon Markets* (CCM) and *Voluntary Carbon Markets* (VCM).

The legislative baseline for Compliance Carbon Markets is so low, people
want to retire more CO<sub>2e</sub>, which they can do through
*Voluntary Carbon Markets.*

For the individual person, there’s no direct access to CO<sub>2</sub>
markets. However, brokers do buy large amounts of carbon credits to
resell in smaller quantities to retail investors.

*“Carbon pricing is not there to punish people,”* says Lion Hirth Lion
Hirth (n.d.). *“It’s there to remind us, when we take travel, heating,
consumption decisions that the true cost of fossil fuels comprises not
only mining and processing, but also the damage done by the
CO<sub>2</sub> they release.”*

*Long term cost* of insufficient climate action is more than *short-term
gains* from delaying efforts to reduce carbon emissions.

-   The total size of carbon markets reached 949 billion USD in 2023,
    including Chinese, European, and North American CO<sub>2</sub>
    trading (LSEG & Susanna Twidale, 02/12/2024, 02:37 PM).

-   *The price of* CO<sub>2e</sub> *differs across markets.* (Stern,
    2022b) argues carbon-neutral economy needs higher CO<sub>2e</sub>
    prices and believes (Rennert et al., 2022) CO<sub>2e</sub> price per
    ton should be 3,6x higher that it is currently. Contrary,
    (Ritz, 2022) argues optimal CO<sub>2</sub> prices could be highly
    asymmetric, low in some countries and high (above the social cost of
    CO<sub>2e</sub>) in countries where production is very polluting.

-   iGenius (2020)

The fossil energy production that’s a large part of global CO2 emissions
has caused several high-profile pollution events. Large ones that got
international news coverage include Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon.

-   Lenton et al. (2023) quantifying human cost of global warming.
-   

CO<sub>2e</sub> credits has given rise to *Carbon Accounting industry.*

-   Watershed is a large carbon accounting company.

-   The legislation has created an industry of CO<sub>2</sub> accounting
    with many companies like Greenly, Sustaxo, etc.

-   Quatrini (2021) sustainability assessments are complex and may give
    flawed results.

-   Nonetheles, CO<sub>2</sub> emission reduction has the added positive
    effect of boosting corporate morale (Cao et al., 2023).

Compliance Carbon Markets

meet legal emission reduction targets

**Cap & Trade**

The share of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions among people around the world is
highly unequal across the world (referred to as ***Carbon
Inequality***). (Chancel, 2022) reports “one-tenth of the global
population is responsible for nearly half of all emissions, half of the
population emits less than 12%”.

-   One example is the ICT sector.

-   Bajarin (n.d.) Over 300 million PCs sold in 2022

    -   *GreenDice - Reinventing the Idea of a Computer-Related Tech
        Purchase* (2021) Estonian company “sustainable lifecycle
        management of IT equipment”
    -   Ärileht (23.09.2022, 12:53) Recycle your phone, FoxWay and
        Circular economy for PCs.
    -   X. Zhou et al. (2022) ICT is an example of inequality, while
        emerging economies bear 82% of the emissions, developed
        countries gain 58% of value.

**Emissions Trading Schemes**

From Carbon Offsets to Carbon Credits

-   “A carbon credit represents one tonne of carbon dioxide that has
    been prevented from entering or has been removed from the
    atmosphere” (Anna Watson, 2022, 2023).

Retiring CO<sub>2</sub> allowances

-   Facilitating citizens’ access to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions trading
    may be an efficient method to organize large-scale CO<sub>2</sub>
    retiring (Rousse, 2008).

As of 2024 there’s no single global CO<sub>2</sub> trading market but
rather several local markets as described in the table below.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[14] }} />

Most of the world is not part of a CO<sub>2</sub> market.

-   (Sipthorpe et al., 2022) compares traditional and blockchain-based
    solutions to carbon trading.

-   “Blockchain solutions for carbon markets are nearing maturity” and
    offer many improvements. enhancing transparency, trust, and
    efficiency.

-   (United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), 2021) report. “The
    Emissions Gap Report (EGR) 2021: The Heat Is On shows that new
    national climate pledges combined with other mitigation measures put
    the world on track for a global temperature rise of 2.7°C by the end
    of the century. That is well above the goals of the Paris climate
    agreement and would lead to catastrophic changes in the Earth’s
    climate. To keep global warming below 1.5°C this century, the
    aspirational goal of the Paris Agreement, the world needs to halve
    annual greenhouse gas emissions in the next eight years.

-   (United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), 2021) report “If
    implemented effectively, net-zero emissions pledges could limit
    warming to 2.2°C, closer to the well-below 2°C goal of the Paris
    Agreement. However, many national climate plans delay action until
    after 2030. The reduction of methane emissions from the fossil fuel,
    waste and agriculture sectors could help close the emissions gap and
    reduce warming in the short term, the report finds. Carbon markets
    could also help slash emissions. But that would only happen if rules
    are clearly defined and target actual reductions in emissions, while
    being supported by arrangements to track progress and provide
    transparency.”

Voluntary Carbon Markets are …

Voluntary Carbon Markets (VCM) lack standardization and transparency
(Ela Khodai, 2023).

*Carbon Credits* are useful for private companies who wish to claim
*carbon neutrality, climate positivity*, or other related claim, which
might be viewed in good light by their clients or allow the companies to
adhere to certain legislative requirements.

There are many companies which facilitate buy carbon credits as well as
a few organizations focused on carbon credit verification.

-   In Estonia, startups Arbonic and Single.Earth are trialing this

### Overconsumption \> Earth’s Boundaries {#overconsumption-earths-boundaries}

Excessive consumer lifestyle - *overconsumption* - is one of the main
drivers of climate change and environmental destruction, with *“2/3 of
global GHG emissions are directly and indirectly linked to household
consumption, with a global average of about 6 tonnes CO<sub>2</sub>
equivalent per capita”* , according to (Ivanova et al., 2020; Renee Cho,
2020). An older study put the number as high as 60% percent (Ivanova et
al., 2016) while (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, Material Economics,
2019)’s models 45% show of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent emissions come from
our shopping; produced by companies to make the products we consume.

With the trend of urbanization, it’s not surprising (people living in)
cities are responsible for 80% of the emissions (Rosales Carreón &
Worrell, 2018). (Moberg et al., 2019) reports daily human activities
emission contribution on average in four European countries (France,
Germany, Norway and Sweden).

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[17] }} />

Earth’s growing population reached 8 Billion people In November 2022 and
population projections by predict 8.5B people by 2030 and 9.7B by 2050
(The Economic Times, 2022; United Nations Department of Economic and
Social Affairs, Population Division, 2022). Indeed, making *anything*
consumes natural resources, which are limited on planet Earth. (Hassoun
et al., 2023) forecasts increase of global food demand by 62% driven by
the impact of climate change. Yet, while population growth puts higher
pressure on Earth’s resources, some researchers propose the effect is
higher from wasteful lifestyles than the raw number of people (Cardinale
et al., 2012). Meanwhile others, such as (Cafaro et al., 2022), believe
*\[o\]verpopulation is a major cause of biodiversity loss and smaller
human populations are necessary to preserve what is left.”*

While the numbers on overconsumption are clear, the debate on
overconsumption is so polarized, it’s difficult to have a meaningful
discussion of the topic (Ianole & Cornescu, 2013). Environmental risks
from human activities are known as Anthropogenic Threat Complexes (ATCs)
(Bowler et al., 2020)*.* As long as humanity is a mono-planetary
species, we have to come to terms with the limitations of our home,
Earth.

### Plastic Pollution

Overconsumption is also one of the root causes of plastic pollution.
(Ford et al., 2022) and (Lavers et al., 2022) find strong links between
climate change and marine plastic pollution *“along with other stressors
that threaten the resilience of species and habitats sensitive to both
climate change and plastic pollution”*.

Plastic pollution is pervasive around the Earth and is fundamentally
linked to climate change, while microplastics are increasingly a real
concern (Lavers et al., 2022; Tiernan et al., 2022). Several
international studies report recent findings of microplastics everywhere
in human bodies: the brain, lungs, digestive tissues, bone marrow,
penis, testis, seminal fluid (semen), and placenta - causing serious
health and reproductive concerns (Codrington et al., 2024; Garcia et
al., 2024; Guo et al., 2024; Hu et al., 2024; N. Li et al., 2024; Main,
2024; Montano et al., 2023; L. Zhu et al., 2024)

    high-income countries lead lifestyles incompatible with planetary
    boundaries’*.
-   Overconsumption and underinvestment.

**tipping points** - Armstrong McKay et al. (2022) discusses tipping
points. - TED (2024)

In addition to the enormity of over-reaching CO<sub>2</sub> emissions,
humanity is facing other massive environmental problems. The Stockholm
Resilience Centre reports we have already breached 4 out of our 9
*“planetary boundaries”:* in addition to climate change, biodiversity
loss (Extinctions per Million Species per Year aka E/MSY), land-system
change (deforestation, land degradation, etc), and biogeochemical flows
(cycles of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, etc); on a positive side, the
challenges of fresh water use, ocean acidification and stratospheric
ozone depletion are still within planetary limits (Persson et al.,
2022).

In 1948, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) was
founded, which in

LULUCF “Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry” can both be a source of
greenhouse gas emissions - or a carbon sink (removing CO2 from the
atmosphere).

### Earth System Law, Planetary Health, and Social Cost of CO<sub>2</sub>

*Planetary Health*, *Earth System Law, and* Social Cost of Carbon are 3
approaches to address the complex interdependence of humans with our
physical environment.

Scientists in cross-disciplinary teams have been working on integrating
Earth systems and human society into cohesive frameworks.

Evolving Measurements from Planetary Boundaries to Planetary Health

-   Planetary health (Planetary Health Alliance, 2024a, 2024b)

-   Wardani et al. (2023) *“long-term human well-being is dependent on
    the well-being of the planet, including both biotic and abiotic
    systems. It recognizes interlinkages across environmental
    sustainability, public health, and socioeconomic development.”*

*Earth System Law* is a framework for addressing interconnected
environmental challenges (Du Toit & Kotzé, 2022).

*Social Cost of Carbon* attempts to measures the compound impact of
CO<sub>2e</sub> emissions on society. Sustainability is filled with
complexities. CO<sub>2e</sub> emissions are complicated by biodiversity
loss, child labor, slavery, poverty, chemical pollution, etc. - many
issues become intertwined (TEDx Talks, 2020). One attempt to measure
these complexities, is the *Social Cost of Carbon* (SCC) which is
defined as *“additional damage caused by an extra unit of emissions”*
(Kornek et al., 2021; Zhen et al., 2018). For example the cost of
damages caused by “one extra ton of carbon dioxide emissions” (Stanford
University, 2021). SCC variations exist between countries (Tol, 2019)
and regions (Yong Wang et al., 2022).

-   

-   (J. Lin et al., 2022) says, apart from CO<sub>2</sub>, reduction of
    other atmospheric pollutants, such as non-CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse
    gases (GHGs) and short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) is required
    for climate stability.

-   (T.-P. Wang & Teng, 2022): Quantifying climate damage proposes
    scenarios of climate damage.

## Ecosystem Services: Quantifying Human Benefits from Nature

*Ecosystem services measure the benefits humans receive from the
biosphere.* Put most simply, *ecosystem services* enable human life on
Earth. While it can be assumed much of the flora and fauna are crucial
for Earth’s systems, science is still in the process of understanding
and quantifying its contributions. The history of the valuation of
nature’s services goes back to the 18th century when David Ricardo and
Jean Baptiste Say discussed nature’s *work*, however both considered it
should be free (Gómez-Baggethun et al., 2010). In 1997 (G. C. Daily,
1997) proposed the idea of *ecosystem services* and (Costanza et al.,
1997) attempted to assess the amount of ecosystem services provided. (Le
Provost et al., 2022)’s study shows *biodiversity* as one key factor to
maintain delivery of ecosystem services. (Noriega et al., 2018) attempts
to quantify the ecosystem services (ES) provided by insects.

The most complex computer models which attempt to capture ever more
interactions happening in the physical realm are called *digital twins.*
The EU is developing a digital twin of Earth to help sustainability
prediction and planning, integrating Earth’s various systems such as
climate, hydrology, ecology, etc, into a single model *Destination Earth
Shaping Europe’s Digital Future* (2023). We can use all the data being
recorded to provide a digital twin of the planet, nature, ecosystems and
human actions to help us change our behavior and optimize for planetary
wellbeing.

-   Jackson (1996) *preventive environmental management*

### Biosphere

Earth’s biosphere is made up of 846 terrestrial ecoregions, which are
distributed across 14 major biomes and 8 biogeographical realms
(Dinerstein et al., 2017).

### Ecological Indicators

Sustainability can be measured using a variety of *ecological
indicators*.

Ecological indicators for Earth *- I would like to coin the word
“ecomarkers” -* are like *biomarkers* in human health.

Technological advances help scientist better understand nature. Cutting
edge research uses AI-based voice recognition for listening to nature,
assessing biodiversity based on species’ sounds in the forest. Millions
of detections of different species with machine learning passive
acoustic AI models, can also assess species’ response to climate change
(AI for Good, 2023; Guerrero et al., 2023).

*Environmental DNA (eDNA)* helps scientists measure species abundance
without direct observation through detection of DNA on genetic materials
such as skin cells (Peter Andrey Smitharchive page, 2024). Cellular DNA
can be isolated from various sediment types (Ogram et al., 1987). Beyond
scientific applications, eDNa is being used to generate biodiversity
credits by environmental asset rating companies such as BeZero (Ojoatre
& Atkinson, 2023).

AI is being used to map icebergs and measure the change in size
(European Space Agency, 2023).

### Biodiversity

Why Protect Biodiversity?

(May, 2011) argues biodiversity loss is a concern for 3 points of views:

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[18] }} />

-   

-   Meanwhile the destruction pressure on ecosystems is rapidly
    increasing (ADD CITATION A B C).

-   Y. Chen et al. (2023) Ecosystem vulnerability **(need access)**

-   Z. Zhang et al. (2023) Integrating ecosystem services conservation
    into urban planning **(need access)**

-   L. Li et al. (2023) tourism is a large industrial sector which
    relies on ecosystem services. In Taiwan, (T. H. Lee et al., 2021)
    developed a framework of indicators to assess sustainable tourism.

**Measuring Environmental Degradation**

(Almond, R.E.A. et al., 2022) reported, the number of species killed,
mass destruction of nature. “69% decline in the relative abundance of
monitored wildlife populations around the world between 1970 and 2018.
Latin America shows the greatest regional decline in average population
abundance (94%), while freshwater species populations have seen the
greatest overall global decline (83%).”

![](_thesis_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-19-output-1.png)

Biodiversity loss is linked to overconsumption, weak legislation and
lack of oversight. (Crenna et al., 2019) recounts European Union
consumers’ negative impact on biodiversity in countries where it imports
food. WWF (2022) case study highlights how 4 biodiverse regions Cerrado
in Brazil, Chaco in Argentina, Sumatra in Indonesia, and the Cuvette
Centrale in Democratic Republic of Congo are experiencing rapid
destruction due to consumer demand in the European Union. While the
European Union (EU) has recently become a leader in sustainability
legislation, biodiversity protection measures among private companies is
very low Marco-Fondevila & Álvarez-Etxeberría (2023).

Meanwhile, there is some progress in biodiversity conservation as
“\[\*b\]iodiversity awareness is now at 72% or higher in all countries
sampled, compared to only 29% or higher across countries sampled in
2009”\* (UEBT, 2022)

**Convention on Biodiversity**

Similarly to climate protection, the UN has taken a leadership role in
biodiversity protection. Unit (2023): The history of the United Nations
Convention on Biodiversity goes back to 1988, when the working group was
founded. UNEP (Tue, 12/20/2022 - 07:44): The Convention on Biodiversity
2022 (COP15) adopted the first global biodiversity framework to
accompany climate goals.

### Oceans

Blue carbon.

**Marine Heatwaves**

-   Gelles & Andreoni (2023) describe how marine heatwaves threaten
    global biodiversity. Ocean warming leads to coral bleaching of the
    Great Barrier Reef in Queensland, east coast of Australia (Pfeiffer,
    2024).
-   Espinosa & Bazairi (2023) marine ecosystem services **(need access,
    ncku doesn’t sub)**
-   Howard et al. (2017) argues Oceans play crucial role in carbon
    capture.

### Forest

Forests are a crucial part of Earth’s carbon cycle and the main natural
CO<sub>2</sub> capture system; due to deforestation, Europe rapidly
losing its forest carbon sink (Frédéric Simon, 2022). Around 27% of
Earth’s land area is still covered by forests yet *deforestation* is
widespread all around the world; highest rates of deforestation happened
in the tropical rainforests of South America and Africa, mainly caused
by agricultural cropland expansion (50% of all deforestation) and
grazing land for farm animals to produce meat (38,5%), totaling close to
90% of global deforestation (*FRA 2020 Remote Sensing Survey*, 2022).
The global forest cover change is visible on Google’s Earth Engine
(Hansen et al., 2013).

Around the world, there are many initiatives to increase forest cover,
for example the *1 billion tree project* (Bastin et al., 2019; “Erratum
for the Report,” 2020; Greenfield & @pgreenfielduk, 2021). However, it’s
important to not planting trees (*afforestation)* is not the full
solution, as *afforestation* is different from *reforestation*, which
takes into account biodiversity. Also, while using remote-sensing and
machine-learning to assess reforestation potential (see Klosterman et
al., 2022), it doesn’t take into account local political realities.

-   Burning of biomass undermines carbon capture.
-   Bousfield et al. (2022) reports there’s evidence paying landowners
    for the ecosystem services their forests provide may reduce
    deforestation.
-   nature-based solutions.

### Pollution

In, Taiwan this is the ranking of pollution reports by citizens
(Ministry of Digital Affairs, 2024):

```

![](_thesis_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-21-output-2.png)

Health and sustainability are inextricably linked. “Human health is
central to all sustainability efforts.”, *“All of these (food, housing,
power, and health care), and the stress that the lack of them generate,
play a huge role in our health”* (Sarah Ludwig Rausch & Neha Pathak,
2021).

*Design Implications* Start with the most polluted regigons as priority?

**Air Pollution**

Clean air is a proposed as a *human right* (Baroness Jones of
Moulsecoomb & Caroline Lucas, 2023) yet air pollution is widespread
around the planet, with 99% of Earth’s human population being affected
by bad air quality that does not meet WHO air quality guidelines,
leading to health problems linked to 6.7 million *premature deaths*
every year (World Health Organization, 2022).

Air pollution is linked to cancer incidence. In Taiwan, South Korea, and
England, groundbreaking research by (Lim et al., 2022) analyzed over
400000 individuals establishes exposure to 2.5μm PM (PM2.5) air
pollution as a *cause for lung cancer.* In (Hannah Devlin, 2022),
professor Tony Mok, of the Chinese University of Hong Kong: *“We have
known about the link between pollution and lung cancer for a long time,
and we now have a possible explanation for it. As consumption of fossil
fuels goes hand in hand with pollution and carbon emissions, we have a
strong mandate for tackling these issues – for both environmental and
health reasons.”*

The main way to combat air pollution is through policy interventions.
(MARIA LUÍS FERNANDES, 2023) the EU has legislation in progress to curb
industrial emissions. If legislation is in place, causing bad air
quality can become bad for business. In China, (Gu et al., 2023) links
air pollution to credit interest rates for business loans; companies
with low environmental awareness and a history of environmental
penalties pay 12 percent higher interest rates. In France, (Bouscasse et
al., 2022) finds strong health and economic benefits across the board
from air pollution reduction.

**Water Pollution**

Globally, 4.4 billion people only have access to water that’s not safe
for drinking (Soliman, 2024).

-   Bioswales help catch storm debris and reduce water pollution.

-   Clean water and water pollution

-   Koch (2022) (**Need access! NYC times)**

-   Paris cleans Seine river for Paris Olympics

**Soil Pollution**

-   *“Wild and ruderal plants as bioindicators of global urban pollution
    by air, water and soil in Riyadh and Abha, Saudi Arabia”* (Picó et
    al., 2023) uses wild and ruderal plants to detect pollution by air,
    water and soil.
-   Bioindicators of anthropogenic pollution, pharmaceuticals,
    pesticides, and other industrial chemicals.
-   Both Abha and Riyadh showed notable levels of pollutants while
    Riyadh with more industry showed higher levels.

### Ready for Disaster

The Word Economic Forums Global Risks Report 2024 paints a bleak picture
of the future with expectations of increased turbulence across the board
based on a survey of over 1400 topic experts (World Economic Forum,
n.d.).

### Weather

Global warming increases the risk of disasters and extreme weather
events.

(*Fifth National Climate Assessment*, 2023) The US Global Change
Research Program presented a comprehensive report to the US Congress,
which links disaster-risk directly to global warming; for examples
increased wildfires damage property, endanger life and reduces *air
quality,* which in effect increases health challenges. As extreme
temperatures are increasingly commonplace, with observed changes in
heatwaves, there’s increased risk of wildfires (Perkins-Kirkpatrick &
Green, 2023; Volkova et al., 2021), while flood risk mapping might lower
property prices in at risk areas (Sherren, 2024). Summers of 2022 and
2023 were the hottest on record so far, with extreme heat waves recorded
in places around the world (Douglas, 2023; Falconer, 2023; National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), U.S. Department of
Commerce, 2023; NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information,
2023; Serrano-Notivoli et al., 2023; Venturelli et al., 2023).

The part of Earth where the *human climate niche* is becoming smaller
(McKibben, 2023). As temperatures rise, certain cities may become
uninhabitable for humans (CBC Radio, 2021). The summer of 2023 saw
extensive wildfires in Spain, Canada, and elsewhere; rapidly moving
fires destroyed the whole city of Lāhainā in Hawaii \[ADD CITATION\]. In
California, (Jerrett et al., 2022) says, *“\[w\]ildfires are the second
most important source of emissions in 2020”* and *“negate reductions in
greenhouse gas emissions from other sectors.”* Some parts of South
America have seen summer heat *in the winter*, with heatwaves with
temperatures as high as 38 degrees (Livingston, 2023).

In Taiwan disaster risk and hazard mapping is well-developed, with early
warning systems, and comprehensive response preparedness - and painful
experiences - instrumental to saving lives (Y.-J. Tsai et al., 2021).
Intensifying storms forming near coastlines, can be expected with
*“\[c\]hanges to tropical cyclone trajectories in Southeast Asia under a
warming climate”* (Garner et al., 2024). The situation on the Pacific
and Atlantic oceans is not dissimilar, with *“\[o\]bserved increases in
North Atlantic tropical cyclone peak intensification rates”* (Garner,
2023).

In the Phillipines, with increasing extreme weather events, *“businesses
are more likely to emerge in areas where infrastructure is resilient to
climate hazards”* (Y. Cheng & Han, 2022).

Climate-related disasters can spur action as extreme weather becomes
visible to everyone. After large floods in South Korea in July 2023 with
many victims, president Joon promised to begin taking global warming
seriously and steer the country towards climate action (AFP, 2023; Al
Jazeera, 2023; Web, 2023). South Korea has a partnership with the
European Union (European Commission, 2023a).

## Financialization of Nature vs Nature is Sacred: Scaling Up Sustainable Action:

There are 2 main approaches to protecting nature:

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[20] }} />

-   (Leverhulme Centre for Nature Recovery, 2023) asks should we put a
    price on nature?
-   Is it time to leave utilitarian environmentalism behind? Muradian &
    Gómez-Baggethun (2021)

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[21] }} />

### Individual Action

Sometimes individual environmental (climate) action *does matter* and
can come at great personal cost, even loss of life. EJAtlas tracks
environmental justice cases around the world, where human stakes are
very high Scheidel et al. (2020).

However, for most of us individual climate action is *ineffective*. The
effect of individual climate action such as *choosing a more sustainable
product* is so limited to be next to meaningless. For individual
consumer choices to make a difference, they need to be *aggregated* into
a movement, collective action with scale, influence, and visibility.

There is no single solution to the environmental crisis. Given the
enormity of environmental degradation, many different approaches are
needed. This chapter documents some of the ongoing work which a
sustainability companion could assist college students get involved
with.

### Restoration

Regenerative Action

-   (Han & Chen, 2022) identifies nature-based solutions “land
    re-naturalization (such as afforestation and wetland restoration)”

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[22] }} />

Ecology, Agroforestry & Permaculture

Some argue sustainability is not enough and we should work on
*regeneration* of natural habitats.

The UN announced 2021-2030 the Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (Fischer
et al., 2021).

-   Agroecology Baltic Sea Action Group (2023)

Agroforestry plays an active role in achieving Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) (Ruba & Talucder, 2023);

-   Food forests for regenerative food systems.
-   Svalbard Seed Vault
-   Irwin et al. (2023)
-   Yadav et al. (2023)
-   G. Low et al. (2023)
-   Ollinaho & Kröger (2023) “bioeconomy is not inherently sustainable
    and may pose considerable risks to biodiversity.”
-   De Queiroz-Stein & Siegel (2023)
-   Gamage et al. (2023) “Organic food and drink sales in 2019 totaled
    more than 106 billion euros worldwide.”

Geopolitical situations can affect technology adoption; after Russia’s
war in Ukraine, Europe needed to quickly reduce consuming cheap Russan
fossil fuel energy (in the form of gas) (Bonasia, 2024). In 2024, for
first time in Europe, renewables in the form of wind and solar energy
surged past production of fossil fuels (Beer, 2024; Graham & Fulghum,
2024)

EU energy mix in 2024

![](_thesis_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-22-output-1.png)

Wind and solar energy overtook fossil energy in Europe.

![](_thesis_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-23-output-1.png)

Globally, renewables also overtook fossil fuels (IEA, 2024).

![](_thesis_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-24-output-1.png)

Meanwhile reduction in coal-power was also possible. Coal is a large CO2
emitter.

![](_thesis_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-25-output-1.png)

“Climatech”, Renewable Energy and Transforming Energy Production

Large technology conglomerates and newly founded startups working in
climate solutions space (often referred to as *climatech* by the media)
have proposed a range of approaches to CO<sub>2</sub> reduction in
Earth’s atmosphere. These technologies include several types of *carbon
capture*, directly from the air (direct air capture or DAC), from the
source of pollution, such as using high–performance filters on factory
chimneys, as well as nature-based solutions such as large scale tree
planting using drones.

Each technology has their own pros and cons. (Vitillo et al., 2022)
illustrates how direct air capture of CO<sub>2</sub> is difficult
because of low concentration and CO<sub>2</sub> capture at the source of
the emissions is more feasible.

-   (Gaure & Golombek, 2022) simulate a CO<sub>2</sub> free electricity
    generation system in the European Union where “98% of total
    electricity production is generated by wind power and solar; the
    remainder is covered by a backup technology.”. The authors stipulate
    it’s possible to power the EU without producing CO<sub>2</sub>
    emissions.

-   **Important: “creating sustainability trust in companies in
    realtime”**

## Complexity: Towards Probabilistic Risk-Based Assessment

Sustainability is a complex web of interconnections.

-   thread of commodification of nature. category mistake. impossible to
    bring back already destroyed biodiversity which took millennia to
    develop. humans create hugely complex systems instead of simply
    conserving nature.

-   The concept of how a public resource is over-used until breaking
    down as each user only bears a fraction of the cost - know as
    *tragedy of the commons* -was described by the ecologist Garrett
    Hardin in 1968 (Hardin, 1968; Lopez et al., 2022; Meisinger, 2022;
    Murase & Baek, 2018).

## Eco-Design: The Legislative Perspective

In the European Union, *eco-design* has political support as part of the
EU *“Green Deal”* legislative strategy, aiming to transform European
economies into sustainability leaders. Eco-design playslarge part of the
proposal by (Commission et al., 2014) because the product lifecycle’s
environmental impact is defined in the design process. The Ecodesign for
Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR) entered into force in the EU on
July 18, 2024 (European Commission, 2024) following the (European
Parliament, 2022) proposal whereby the European Commission established a
general framework for *eco-design: “requirements for sustainable
products, repealing rules \[referring to the previous Eco-Design
Directive (2009/125/EC)\] currently in force which concentrate on
energy-related products only,”* setting up a level playing-field for the
organizations operating on the EU single market. Virginijus Sinkevičius,
the EU Commissioner for the Environment, Oceans and Fisheries, is quoted
describing eco-design as design that *“respects the boundaries of our
planet”* (European Commission, 2022c).

It’s not that the EU didn’t have an environmental policy before; rather
it was more vague and filled with loop-holes. CSRD (Corporate
Sustainability Reporting Directive) replaces NFRD (Non-Financial
Reporting Directive). ESRS reporting is a standard to meet CSRD
requirements.

The EU is also concerned with supply-chain deforestation. Sustainable
Products and EUDR (European Union Deforestation Regulation) work
hand-in-hand as part of EU’s legislative efforts to promote
sustainability. EUDR applies to all products placed on the market from
30 December 2024 and 30 June 2025 for small businesses.

The EU “Green Deal” legislative strategy is comprehensive. Eco-Design is
a Key EU Sustainable Policy Design Tool.

Europe is transforming into a hotbed of sustainability. One of the EU
goals is reducing careless consumption. Tacking our consumption habits
can help support eco-designed products. It’s up to legislators to
provide sustainable products on our marketplace… but until this happens,
we can use the green filter.

The 9 qualities of *eco-designed products* include

Europe is not the only region undertaking legislative efforts to promote
sustainability. In the US, the *Inflation Reduction Act* provides
funding to development of decarbonizing technologies and includes plans
to combat air pollution, reduce green house gases and address
environmental injustices (Rajagopalan & Landrigan, 2023). Many other
jurisdictions also have laws that aim to reduce the environmental impact
of products throughout their life cycles. For instance Australia has a
Product Stewardship (PS) scheme, which also includes an investment fund
targeted at increasing the recycling rates of specific products
(Australian Government, 2024). Australia, Japan, and Taiwan all have
Sustainable Procurement schemes prioritizing greener products in public
purchases \[ADD CITATION\]. While Taiwan doesn’t yet have a specific
eco-design law, there are various pieces of legislation promoting
circular economy \[ADD CITATION\]. Already in 1988 Taiwan implemented an
Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme, followed by a recycling
system (initially focused on electronic items) in 1998 (Chong et al.,
2009). Eco-design initiatives in Taiwan started at least as early as
1994, when Taiwanese companies and universities noticed international
sustainability trends and began to implement their own sustainable
design initiatives (Jahau Lewis Chen et al., 2005).

The key to comparing Product Stewardship, Extended Producer
Responsibility (EPR), and Eco-Design is the scope, as illustrated in the
chart above. While Product Stewardship (PS) and Extended Producer
Responsibility (EPR) deal mostly with the end of the product lifecycle
(they are *reactive*), including their disposal and recycling (EPR going
a step further than PS by shifting the responsibility to the producer),
Eco-Design moves sustainability up the design chain (being
*pro-active*), setting standards for making better products - in
essence, attempting to *design-out* the waste.

## Design is Political Action

Design *is* political.

I was torn whether to place *politics* under *sustainability* or
*design*, and decided for the latter - as sustainability is mostly
*descriptive*, using science to measure and present the real situation,
while design is *prescriptive*: codifying decisions about how do we
live - in products and services.

Politics matters in sustainability. In Brazil, deforestation fell 60% in
1 year, based on remote satellite reconnaissance, after the election of
a more pro-environment leadership (Watts, 2023).

-   Pater (2021)
-   10 countries use almost 100% renewable energy

There’s ample evidence from several countries suggesting moving to
renewal energy brings environmental benefits:

-   Amin et al. (2022) suggests “removing fossil fuel subsidies and
    intra-sectoral electricity price distortions coupled with carbon
    taxes provides the highest benefits” for both the economy and the
    environment in Bangladesh.

-   J. Luo et al. (2022) suggests using reinforcement learning to reduce
    energy use in cooling systems.

-   Montreal protocol eradicates CfCs and the ozone holes became whole
    again.

***Mitigating*** **Climate Change**

The monumental task of removing several gigatons of CO<sub>2</sub> from
the atmosphere requires massive policy shifts and collaboration across
countries and industries (Mackler et al., 2021).

Warming global climate has concrete effects on daily life. Warmer
climate helps viruses and fungi spread (Press, 2023). (Williams & Joshi,
2013) higher CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the air can cause more
turbulence for flights.

***Adapting*** **to Climate Change**

Many companies are developing technologies for mitigation.

In the European Union (EU), a wide range of legislative proposals,
targets, organizations, and goals already exists across diverse
countries. Upcoming laws aim to harmonize approaches to sustainability
and raise standards for all members states, in turn influencing
producers who wish to sell in the EU common market. National governments
need to adapt EU legislation to local contexts. For example Estonian
government adopted the Estonian Green Deal Action Plan (Eesti Rohepöörde
Tegevusplaan) (Eesti Vabariigi Valitsus, 2022).

-   The EU has a *taxonomy of environmentally sustainable economic
    activities* published by the Technical Expert Group (TEG) on
    sustainable finance, as detailed in the report by (*EU Taxonomy for
    Sustainable Activities*, n.d.).

**Taxes**

Calculating what’s sustainable is hugely complex because decisions may
have unforeseen ramifications. For example (Nuez et al., 2022) shows how
electric vehicles may increase CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in some areas,
such as Canary Islands, where electricity production is polluting.

-   Rossi et al. (2022) shows how introducing sustainability early in
    the design process and providing scenarios where sustainability is a
    metric, it’s possible to achieve more eco-friendly designs.

We have an opportunity to re-imagine how every product can be an
eco-product and how they circulate in our circular economy.

Timeline of the Policy Context:

-   In 2019 by the von der Leyen commission adopted the European Union
    (EU) Green Deal strategy.

-   In 2021 the Commision proposed a goal of reducing CO2e emissions by
    55% by 2030 under the *Fit for 55* policy package consisting of a
    wide range of economic measures.

-   In November 2022, the proposal was adopted by the EU Council and EU
    Parliament with an updated goal of 57% of CO2e reductions compared
    to 1990. This proposal is set to become a binding law for all EU
    member countries (European Commission (2019c); European Commission
    (2019a); *EU Reaches Agreement on National Emission Reductions*
    (2022); European Council (2022)).

-   In March 2022, the EU Circular Economy Action Plan was adopted,
    looking to make sustainable products *the norm* in EU and
    *empowering consumers* as described in European Commission (2022a).
    Each product covered by the policy is required to have a ***Digital
    Product Passport*** which enables improved processing within the
    supply chain and includes detailed information to empower consumers
    to understand the environmental footprint of their purchases. It’s
    safe to say the large majority of products available today do not
    meet these criteria.

## Design with Open Data

Open data is needed for civic engagement. Sharing vs Privacy is a
political question. Privacy and data-sharing are not in opposition.
Sustainability needs to be balanced with privacy. (Sanchez et al., 2022)
suggests tracking users using their smartphones and attributing points
for actions deemed beneficial yet this has potentially privacy issues.

Open Data Enables Collaboration. Taiwan is a proponent of Open Gov
OP-MSF OGP (Lab, 2021; Open Government Partnership, 2021).

Enhance interoperability *What Is Open Data?* (n.d.)

Open Knowledge International’s Global Open Data Index (GODI) ranked
Taiwan as number 1 in its global index in 2017; the project has since
been discontinued, so the ranking may be out of date in 2024 (Open
Knowledge Foundation, 2017).

Other indexes do not include Taiwan in the TOP 10.

![](_thesis_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-30-output-1.png)

Data-driven design requires access to data. making the movement towards
*open data sharing* very important. Some countries and cities are better
than others at sharing data openly.

For example the Open Data Portal of Malaysia shows a steady decline in
Permanent Reserved Forests (PRF) for anyone interested, without having
to submit any letter of request or communicate with officials; the data
is just directly accessible and includes a permissive license (Malaysia,
2024).

## Design for Sustainability: Diversity of Approaches

*Designing for Sustainability* *(DfS)* has been called with many names,
with subtle differences of emphasis and nuance. While the ESPR
legislation chose *Eco-Design* as the overarching title, researchers and
practitioners discuss and use *Circular Design*, *Cradle-to-Cradle
Design*, *Green Design*, *Regenerative Design*, *Climate-Responsive
Design*, *Life-Centered Design*, and many others.

In most cases, designing for sustainability makes use of *systems
thinking*, underlining the importance of looking at the entire lifecycle
of a product or service. Sustainable design encompasses all human
activities, making this pursuit an over-arching challenge across all
industries and all human activities with the complex interdependencies
contained within. (Ceschin & Gaziulusoy, 2016) gives a comprehensive
overview of the main themes of sustainable design and the main
contributions and limitations in the well–researched *“Evolution of
design for sustainability: From product design to design for system
innovations and transitions”*.

R. Buckminster Fuller “Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth”, Victor
Papanek “Design for the Real World”, Jonathan Chapman “Emotionally
Durable Design”, Carlo Vezzoli “Product-Service System Design for
Sustainability”, Ezio Manzini “Design, When Everybody Designs”.

(Engkvist, 2024) calls for *Design Sociology*, design should take
account the product’s effect on society, giving the example of highly
individualized understanding of individualized psychology and dopamine
cycles for creating social media, while disregarding the societal
effects, such as spread of misinformation. Lack of sustainability in the
design process is a *bug* in the design approach.

*Service Design*, Ceschin & Gaziulusoy (2016) shows how design for
sustainability has expanded from a product focus to systems-thinking
focus placing the product inside a societal context of use. For example
*Cargo Bike FREITAG* (n.d.), recycled clothing maker FREITAG offers
sustainability-focused services such as cargo bikes so you can transport
your purchases and a network for *shopping without payment* = swapping
your items with other members, as well as repairs of their products.
Loaning terminology from *service design*, the user journey within an
app needs to consider each touchpoint on the way to a state of success.

![](_thesis_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-32-output-1.png)

As this research is *practice-oriented* (i.e., my goal here is to find
design approaches that could influence my prototype), I will focus on
some fields of design which I hope relevant, fruitful, or contextual to
my project.

I will start with *Human-Centered Design*, the grandfather of design
with attitude. There’s even an ISO standard for human-centered design,
with the designated code ISO9241-210, revised as ISO 9241-210:2019
titled *“Ergonomics of human-system interaction”* and up for revision
soon (ISO standards are reviewed every 5 years). Some of the key
takeaways include “Understanding and specifying the context of use”,
“Involving users throughout design and development”, “Specifying user
requirements”, “Evaluating designs”, “Multi-disciplinary Collaboration”,
“Iterative process” and “Continual Improvement”, and finally - usability
is not enough, the design should provide a user experience (UX) for
human “emotional responses and satisfaction” (ISO, 2019).

While *Human-Centered Design* focuses exactly on what it says - humans -
*Life-Centered Design* recognizes human impact on our surrounding
environment as well - making sure we include non-human animals among our
stakeholders. This is where we are getting on the *territory* of
sustainability. While *Human-Centered Design* is ever popular, the
effect humans are having on biodiversity is rarely considered when
designing. *“\[T\]he design phase of a physical product accounts for 80%
of its environmental impact”* notes(Borthwick et al., 2022) in their
framework for life-centered design.

If we’re including *other* lifeforms among our stakeholders, what can we
learn from them? *Biomimicry* is about being inspired by nature while
*Biodesign* focuses on design involving biology in the design itself.
Janine Benyus, who coined the word *Biomimicry* (Benyus, 2009) looks at
very practical cases of innovation where engineers and biologist meet
and (Dicks, 2023) provides a much more philosophical account of
following the example of nature. Focusing on the financial sector,
(Thomas & Mantri, 2022)’s philosophical account advocates for an
“inside-out” design pattern, much like natural systems, starting from
the smallest structures to guarantee resilience and survival, instead of
trying to control their external environment.

In a similar vein, *Material Ecology* is the wording preferred by the
architect Neri Oxman based at the MIT Media Lab working with
biomaterials as a proponent of *Nature-Centric Design* that adheres to
the principles of ecological sustainability with both an ecologically
conscious mindset and practical toolset (Hencz, 2022). Language and our
mental concepts shape our reality, which makes language-creation an
important tool for sustainability. Neri Oxman’s expressions in her
(World Economic Forum, 2016) interview introduce some new vocabulary:
*“ecology-indifferent”*, *“naturing”*, *“mother naturing”*, *“design is
a practice of letting go of all that is unnecessary”*, *“nature should
be our single client”*, which reminds me how self-invented language
gives un child-like freedom to imagine new worlds.

*Speculative Design* can help us imagine *non-anthropocentric* (Edwards
& Pettersen, 2023; Hupkes & Hedman, 2022)as well as *dystopian* futures
(Pinto et al., 2021). First introduced by (Dunne & Raby, 2013) in their
seminal book, the field aims to question the intersection of *user
experience design* and *speculative fiction*. (Barendregt & Vaage, 2021)
explores the potential of speculative design to stimulate public
engagement; thought experiments can spur public debate on an issue
chosen by the designer. Phil Balagtas, founder of The Design Futures
Initiative at McKinsey, discusses the value of building future scenarios
at his talk at Google. His favorite example, the Apple Knowledge
Navigator, first appeared in an Apple vision video in 1987 and took two
decades to materialize in the real world. It was inspired by a similar
device first shown in a 1970s episode of Star Trek as a *magic device*
(a term from participatory design), which then inspired subsequent
consumer product development. It took another two decades, until the
launch of the iPhone in 2007 - a total of 40 years.

*Participatory Design* and *Speculative Design* can be complementary as
in the work of (Neuhoff et al., 2023), used together to focus on
engaging users deep in the design process to truly understand their
needs, contexts and interactions on a non-superficial level. For both
speculative and participatory design, the cost and makes it into a niche
activity. Generative AI holds the promise to allow designers to dream up
and prototype quicker. In order to build a future, it’s relevant to
imagine and critique a future. By being quickly generate prototypes,
once can test out ideas with the future users involving more of the
community and stakeholders. To be able to build something, one first
needs to imagine it; imagination is crucial for change.

*Speculative Design* helps us envision future scenarios

Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is a source of many
fantastic innovations, and another.

*Regenerative Design* suggests *de*materializing (digitizing) economies
is not enough to be sustainable (by reduction of physical impact).
Design should look beyond reducing harm and find avenues to *regenerate*
damaged or even completely destroyed natural systems – ecosystems,
biodiversity, land, forests, lakes, rivers - natural habitats.

Sufficiency

Moving from products and (digital) experiences towards the built
environment and architecture, *Climate-Responsive Design* embeds a
building within the environmental constraints of a place and looks for
opportunities use the land, wind, sun, local materials, and local
vernacular history and culture when considering a design. Architect
Susanne Brorson suggests sustainability should be considered in the
earlier phases of design instead of trying to fix problems later
discussing *climate-responsive design principles* (EVM maaarhitektuuri
keskus, 2019). The sentiment is echoed by (S. Lee & Doevendans, 2011)
who edited a volume on sustainable approaches of world-renowned
architects: *“The principles of sustainable design are rooted in the
building’s relationship to the site and its environmental conditions
such as topography, vegetation, and climate.”*

Architecture of the Well-Tempered Environment (Banham, 1999)

*Designing for Trust*, Weinschenk (2011) says *“People expect most
online interactions to follow the same social rules as person-to-person
interactions. It’s a shortcut that your brain uses to quickly evaluate
trustworthiness.”*

*Cradle-to-Cradle Design*, focusing on recyclability of products.
“台灣設計研究院（TDRI ） on Instagram” (2021) and 活動通 (n.d.) Cradle
to Cradle Nordic circular design in Taiwan

*Durability* is an important dimension for sustainability. High quality
durable products are more sustainable as they last longer and less
likely to be thrown away. Forming an emotional bond with the product
makes it feel more valuable (Zonneveld & Biggemann, 2014). (Chapman,
2009) argues in his seminal paper (and later in his book) for
*“Emotionally Durable Design”*, the simple idea that we hold to things
we value and thus they are sustainable. We don’t throw away a necklace
gifted to us by mom, indeed this object might be passed down for
centuries. (Rose, 2015) has a similar idea, where *“Enchanted Objects”*
become so interlinked with us, we’re unlikely to throw them away. This
has implications for sustainability as the object is less likely to be
thrown away.

As the above shows, there are many partially overlapping design words
created by different people for diverse purposes. Design vocabulary may
be created for distinguishing a particular type of design from another -
or to market oneself as the creator of the word. There are designers who
define / brand themselves by their design method. Design Studies, a
field that studies *design* as a subject.

Here I will use the lens of *sustainability* - another complex term - to
look at how design can contribute to eco-friendly products. I advocate
looking at design methods as a toolbox, where I can pick the tool
suitable for the problem set in front of me. Here I look at a small
number of design practices I find relevant to designing a sustainability
app for college students.

than traditional design methods. While AI allows us to look at a larger
number of design scenarios thank previously feasible, there are many
approaches looking for ways to design for sustainability. Designing for
Sustainability is fundamentally a hopeful act imbibed with the dream a
healthier world is possible.

### Future Scenarios: Avoiding the Worst Cases

In sustainability there are rarely good choices. Rather it’s a question
of avoiding the worst choices.

*Scenario-building* is a key tool for sustainability. Because
sustainability is so complex, sustainable design makes use of scenarios.

*Life Cycle Assessment* and *Environmental Impact Analysis* are needed
to provide eco-design scenarios (de Otazu et al., 2022).

user experience, iteration (Google Design, 2019)

### In Practice Sustainability Begins in Software

Designing user interfaces for sustainable interactions means
incorporating data and toolsets to enable designers to make decisions
which reduce emissions of their design. Companies like AutoDesk are
putting CO<sub>2</sub> calculations inside their design software,
helping designers reduce material usage, energy consumption,
CO<sub>2e</sub> emissions, while increasing recyclability(Mike Haley,
2022). Software is key to building more sustainable products, already
for decades (B. B. Gupta et al., 2023). AI-assisted design enables
design for sustainability because the design process is where
sustainability begins. AI has the potential to provide the parameters
for sustainability. (Singh & Sarkar, 2023) proposes an AI tool for
deciding the suitable life cycle design parameters.

Design encompasses most everything in our daily lives. Humans live in
artificial environments where *most* *things* are designed by humans.
The *experiences* we take part in are increasingly created based on some
type of data.

-   Involving young HCI designers in AI-oriented workshops can show the
    future of UI/UX ? (Battistoni et al., 2023)

Data is the *interface* between idle resources and retail demand, which
makes *exchange of value* possible.

-   Different Gets Ignored Luke Wroblewski (2024)

*Digital Sustainability*, information pertaining to emissions would flow
through the economy not unlike the carbon cycle itself.

(Pan & Nishant, 2023) proposes 6 dimensions of *AI* usage in *Digital
Sustainability.*

Notice: The chart is purely illustrative to highlight the value of AI
for sustainablity; it’s not based on numeric metrics.

## Data-Driven Design: Learning from the Growth of Digital Platforms and Superapps

Digital platforms are focused on *Growth Design*, how to *attract* and
*retain* users. Superapps are the latter stage of the Digital Platform
Economy, where previously vertically targeted apps expand horizontally
to provide an ever-increasing number of services.

For digital products (apps) the main application of interaction design
is for *growth* in usage, how to get more people (user journey and
conversion funnels) to use the product i.e user acquisition, retention,
engagement, and monetization and keep using it (retention and
engagement), often optimizing onboarding, features, and personalization
(Kende, 2023; Steger, 2019).

-   Hypothesis and validation for iterating on features.

-   Total addressable market (TAM), serviceable addressable market
    (SAM), target audience (TA)

Platform economy companies popularized and expanded Data-Driven Design
in the service of growth marketing (also known colloquially as growth
hacking). Capturing User Data was part of this strategy which enabled
improving the products. Digital Product Design is increasingly
data-driven. Digital platforms operate a *design as a process* in a
continuous feedback loop, where *measurements*, *experiments,*
predictive analytics and personalization form a data-drive design
culture. As we humans go about our daily business, governments and
companies track our activities using various technologies, which
produces massive amounts of user interaction data.

Platform economy companies are the capture and use large amounts of data
from users. Data is useful for designing better products. Designing for
high retention (users keep coming back). Network Effects, the more
people use a platform, the more valuable it becomes. Platforms that
continuously add features (provided consumer legislation allows it) may
eventually evolve into superapps, which are useful for providing
services for a wide category of human needs. Bundling many services
under one super-brand. Superapps are possible thanks to Nudge, Economies
of Scale, Network Effects, Behaviour Design. Large Digital Platforms
have a very small number of workers relative to the number of users they
serve. This creates the necessity for using automation for both
understanding user needs and providing the service itself. Creating a
good product that’s useful for the large majority of users depends on
*Data-Driven Design.*

Design is as much about how it works as it’s about the interface.

Digital product design can be seen as a specific discipline under the
umbrella of Experience Design. In Michael Abrash (2017) Meta Oculus
augmented reality incubation general manager Laura Fryer: *“People buy
experiences, not technology.”*

Young people expect a product. Intelligent Interfaces use interaction
design to provide relevant and personalized information in the right
context and at the right time.

There are many approaches to design - from playful to practical to
critical and to data-driven. Nonetheless, many types of design share a
common goal designing for a good *user experience*. Simplifying.

*Personalization*: the largest businesses today (measured in number of
users) design the whole user experience.

*Scale,* Popular consumer platforms strive to design solutions that feel
personalized at every touchpoint on the user journey (to use the
language of service design) at the scale of hundreds of billions of
users.

Superapps are honeypots of data that is used for many types of behavior
modeling. (G. Suarez et al., 2021) suggests using alternative data from
super-apps to estimate user income levels, including 4 types of data:
Personal Information, Consumption Patterns, Payment Information, and
Financial services. (Roa et al., 2021) finds super-app alternative data
is especially useful for credit-scoring young, low-wealth individuals.
The massive amounts of data generated by these companies are used by
smart cities to re-design their physical environments.

-   Inspiration from WeChat. Twitter (now X) is becoming a financial
    app. X (formerly Twitter) is becoming a superapp?

-   Uber is creating an all-purpose platform; only 4.1% of rides were
    electric (Levy, 2023).

How can the mobile devices which the majority of us are carrying with us
every day, help us make decisions about the businesses we engage with?
In terms of user experience, can personalized AI advisors empower our
financial actions from shopping to saving and investing?

-   *Platform Economy* marketplace companies like Airbnb, Uber among
    many others match optimize how our cities work.Superapps are
    prevalent in China and South-East Asia. (Giudice, 2020) finds WeChat
    has had a profound impact on changing China into a cashless society,
    underlining how one mobile app can transform social and financial
    interactions of an entire country. China is the home of many
    superapps and (Vecchi & Brennan, 2022) discusses the strategies
    Chinese apps are taking to expand to other markets. (Shabrina
    Nurqamarani et al., 2020) discusses the system consistency and
    quality of South-East Asian superapps Gojek and Grab.

-   Platform economy companies have been criticized for their lack of
    workers rights (ESG). (“Riders in the Smog,” 2024) uses portable air
    pollution tracking devices to documents how gig workers are
    subjected to pollution.

Could there be Sustainability Superapps?

-   How to design sustainability superapps? Lots of options in a single
    app. (Fleet Management Weekly, 2022) “Sustainability and superapps
    top Gartner’s Top 10 2023 Trends List”. (Dave Wallace, 2021) “The
    rise of carbon-centric super apps”. (goodbag, 2023) “goodbag:
    Sustainable Super App”. What would a sustainable investment platform
    that matches green investments with the consumers look like, if one
    saw the side-by-side comparison of investment vehicles on their ESG
    performance? Also (Bernard, 2022).

### Behavioral Design

For several decades, marketing researchers have been looking into how to
affect human behavior towards increasing purchase decisions in commerce,
both offline and online, which is why the literature on behavioral
design is massive. One of the key concepts is *nudge*, first coined in
2008 by the Nobel-winning economist Richard Thaler; nudges are based on
a scientific understanding of human psychology and shortcuts and
triggers that human brains use and leverages that knowledge to influence
humans in small but powerful ways (Thaler & Sunstein, 2009).

The principles of nudge have also been applied to sustainability. For
example, a small study (n=33) in the Future Consumer Lab in Copenhagen
by (Perez-Cueto, 2021) found that designing a “dish-of-the-day” which
was prominently displayed helped to increase vegetarian food choice by
85%. Experiments by (Guath et al., 2022) focused on environmentally
friendly online purchases in Sweden (n=200) suggest nudging can be
effective in influencing online shopping behavior towards more
sustainable options. A study of behavior change in Australia at large
university setting (N = 156) by (Novoradovskaya et al., 2021) found
nudging behavioral change had a significant effect and the author
suggested it may help to avoid some of the *“16 billion paper coffee
cups are being thrown away every year”* globally (based on the
abstract - I was unable to access the full paper).

Google uses nudges in Google Flights and Google Maps, which allow
filtering flights and driving routes by the amount of CO<sub>2</sub>
emissions, as well as surfacing hotels with Green Key and EarthCheck
credentials, while promising new sustainability features across its
portfolio of products (Sundar Pichai, 2021). Such tools are small user
interface nudges which Google’s research calls *digital
decarbonization*, defined by (Implement Consulting Group, 2022) as
*“Maximising the enabling role of digital technologies by accelerating
already available digital solutions”*.

In (Kate Brandt & Matt Brittin, 2022), Google’s Chief Sustainability
Officer Kate Brandt set a target of “at least 20-25%” CO<sub>2</sub>
emission reductions in Europe to reach a net-zero economy and the global
announcement set a target of helping 1 billion people make more
sustainable choices around the world (Jeni Miles, 2022). In addition to
end–users, Google offers digital decarbonization software for
developers, including the Google Cloud Carbon Footprint tool and invests
in regenerative agriculture projects (Google, 2023; *Inside Google’s
Regenerative Agriculture Play Greenbiz*, 2021).

## Personalizing: Sustainability at Scale

-   Personalization, Personal User Experience. social apps require
    personalization, *trust* and *k-factors* (sharing and inviting your
    friends). (Baron, 2023; B. Kim, 2023).

Data-Driven Design Enables Sustainability. Sustainability touches every
facet of human existence and is thus an enormous undertaking. Making
progress on sustainability is only possible if there’s a large-scale
coordinated effort by humans around the planet. For this to happen,
appropriate technological tools are required.

Data-driven design has limitations.

## Personalized Design: Self-Monitoring

Research on *personal data tracking* also known as *quantified self* or
*self-monitoring* is abundant. Wearable devices including the Apple
Watch, Oura Ring, Fitbit and others, combined with apps, help users
track a variety of health metrics. Apart from health, wearable devices
have been used to track other metrics such as physiological parameters
of students at school to determine their learning efficiency (Giannakos
et al., 2020). Not only can health metrics be tracking, but exposure to
pollution as well as personal carbon footprint, are all to some extent
track-able (if not traceable).

Personal data enables behavior change.

### Health and Fitness Tracking

Tracking one’s health and fitness is a familiar mode of *quantified
self*, available to many smartwatch users - and even pretty much to
anyone who has a phone made in the past decade. Apple is a leader in
health tracking, releasing Apple Health in 2008 as an iOS 8 software
feature and the Apple Watch in 2015, filled with health-focused sensors
and features (Apple, 2022b). In 2022 Apple outlined plans for
*“empowering people to live a healthier day,”* promising a new set of
health-features with every release, such as the rumored temperature
measurement inside of Apple Aipord earphones; and providing most of this
data to developers through Apple’s HealthKit health metrics APIs, which
app builders can tap into (Apple, 2022a, 2022c).

Sleep quality is an important aspect of health and many devices and apps
focus on helping people get enough high quality sleep. There’s plenty of
academic literature on how physical activity, as well as environmental
aspects, such as air quality, affect sleep (X. Liu et al., 2019) tracks
how wearable data is used for tracking sleep improvements from exercise.
(Grigsby-Toussaint et al., 2017) made use of sleep apps to construct
humans behaviors also known as *behavioral constructs*.

The Oura ring is an example of *calm technology*, providing helpful data
without calling an attention to itself (Phelan, 2024).

EEG (electroencephalogram), ECG (Electrocardiogram), EDA (Electrodermal
Activity): tracking features of brain, heart and nervous system
activity. Brain Music Lab founder and brain researcher Grace Leslie:
*“brain music sounds like a warm bathtub”*. Tracking blood sugar with
app and patches. Blood sugar trackers. Blood glucose tracking is popular
even for people without diabetes, to optimize their activity (“Is Blood
Sugar Monitoring Without Diabetes Worthwhile?” 2021). Tracking urine
consistency inside your toilet with WithThings. Companies like
NeuralLink are building devices to build meaningful interactions from
brain waves (EEG).

Use technology Wearables to be more aware of one’s health. Example of
quantified self device.

There’s value in developing standardized fitness metrics, which
different digital health providers can use to create dashboards with
comparable data. Even with messy data, AI has a useful role as a
translator between different standards.

Could one track personal sustainability in a similar fashion? (G. Shin
et al., 2019)’s synthesis review of 463 studies shows wearable devices
have potential to influence behavior change towards healthier
lifestyles. Saubade et al. (2016) finds health tracking is useful for
motivating physical activity. The urban environment has an influence on
health.

While so of the behavior changes may sound simple - like switching from
driving to walking - and would have a large environmental effect, they
are hindered by factors from personal motivation to (lack of) suitable
urban architecture. (Delclòs-Alió et al., 2022) discusses walking in
Latin-American cities. Walking is the most sustainable method or
transport but requires the availability of city infrastructure, such as
sidewalks, which many cities still lack.

While the scale of climate change is too big for individual action to
make a difference, individual action can foster hope and a sense of
collective responsibility (Nature, 2020).

-   Kristian Steensen Nielsen (2022) **Individual climate action!!!**

-   The UN has been handing out Global Climate Action Awards since 2011
    for idea such as the Climate Credit Card in Switzerland, which
    automatically tracks emissions of purchases, creates emissions’
    reports for the user which can then be offset with investments in
    climate projects around the world (UNFCCC, 2023a).

-   Give Gen-Z the tools to turn climate anger into positive change to
    transform companies

-   Echeverría et al. (2022) suggests greener modes of mobility.

-   Shop sustainability in Estonia (*Estwatch - Estwatchi värskest
    Uuringust Selgub, Et Eesti Toidupoed... Facebook*, n.d.; Lilleväli,
    2022). Tarbimise jalajälg poes (Helen Saarmets, 2021). Offsets at
    the point of sale (*Grenpay - Heasta Oma CO$_2$ Jalajälg*, n.d.).

-   Green Finance Platform (2020) report predicts the rise of
    personalizing sustainable finance, because of its potential to grow
    customer loyalty, through improving the user experience. Similarly
    to good design, interacting with sustainable finance for the
    ‘green-minded’ demographics, providing a reliable green product is a
    way to build customer loyalty.

Another aspect is tracking one’s mental health. (Tyler et al., 2022)
surveys the use of self-reflection apps in the UK (n=998).

-   Popular Strava (100+ million users) sports assistant provides run
    tracking and feedback (Strava, 2022).

The small screen estate space of mobiles phones and smart watches
necessitates displaying content in a dynamic manner. Virtual reality
glasses (called AR/VR or XR in marketing speak) need dynamic content
because the user is able to move around the environment. These are
questions that interaction design is called upon to solve. Hoang (2022):
*“Dynamic interfaces might invoke a new design language for extended
reality”. it’s a balancing at: while* AI enables generative UIs while
users need some type of stability (think: text input stays in the same
place but different types of interfaces appear within a clearly defined
space.

Speaking is one mode of interaction that’s become increasingly possible
as machines learn to interpret human language.

Human behavior is affected by the environment; example in case, the
incidence of bad behavior during the pandemic increased significantly.

### Towards Tracking Sustainability: Carbon Tracking

The founder of the Commons (formerly known as Joro) consumer
CO<sub>2e</sub> tracking app recounts how people have a gut feeling
about the 2000 calories one needs to eat daily, so perhaps daily
CO<sub>2e</sub> tracking could develop a gut feeling about one’s carbon
footprint (Jason Jacobs, 2019).

-   

Personal carbon footprint tracking apps (aka CO2 calculators) in a
mid-sized German city (N=216) helped overall emission reduction by 23%
correlating with feedback from the app specifically reducing emissions
from heating 26.9%, food 16.4%, household 34.7% reduction, and mobility
12%(S. Hoffmann et al., 2024).

We have a limited carbon budget so calculating CO2e-cost become
integrated into every activity.

-   CO2e calculations will be part of our everyday experience

-   Zhang’s Personal Carbon Economy conceptualized the idea of carbon as
    a currency used for buying and selling goods and services, as well
    as an individual carbon exchange to trade one’s carbon permits (S.
    Zhang, 2018).

Personal Carbon Trackers

Personal carbon footprint calculators have been released online, ranging
from those made by governments and companies to student projects.
Similar to personal health trackers, personal CO<sub>2</sub> trackers
help one track emissions and suggests sustainable actions.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[32] }} />

## Re-Designing Industries: Circularity

As of 2024, *circular economy* is a tiny part of the world economy.
(Circle Economy, 2022) reports only 8.6% of world economy is circular
and *100B tonnes of virgin materials* are sourced every year.

We’re in an industrial revolution. Many companies are investing into
transforming their processes. *“\[T\]ransition to a low carbon economy
presents challenges and potential economic benefits that are comparable
to those of previous industrial revolutions”* (Pearson & Foxon, 2012).
It’s possible to re-design entire industries and that is exactly the
expectation sustainability sets on businesses. Across all industries,
there’s a call for more transparency. Conversations about sustainability
are too general and one needs to look at the specific sustainability
metrics at specific industries to be able to design for meaningful
interaction. There’s plentiful domain-specific research showing how
varied industries can develop eco-designed products. I will here focus
on 3 industries that are relevant for college students.

Food and clothes (I’m omitting housing and transport here) are part of
the immediate environmental impact of college students.

-   6th industrial revolution, quantum computing, nanotechnology

### Circular Design for a Circular Economy

Encouraging Sustainable Design and Reducing Waste.

(K. Liu et al., 2023) reports, e-waste is growing 3%-5% every year,
globally. (Thukral & Singh, 2023) identifies several barriers to e-waste
management among producers including lack of awareness and
infrastructure, attitudinal barriers, existing *informal* e-waste
sector, and the need for an e-waste license.

### Case: Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG)

Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) also known as Consumer Packaged Goods
(CPG) are large global congloremates operating with low margins and high
volumes (Toh, 2024). The largest of them have several billions in
revenue (Kenton, 2024).

![](_thesis_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-37-output-1.png)

Rise of e-commerce has pushed logistics companies to increase delivery
efficiency to keep up with FMCG sales (Deliverect, 2024).

### Case: Fashion

Just like Fast-Moving Consumer Goods, fast fashion operates with low
margins and follows consumer trends. Young people are the largest
consumers of fast fashion (“Young Consumers’ (Complicated) Love For Fast
Fashion In 3 Stats,” n.d.). (In European Environment Agency, 2022
European Environment Agency (EEA)) estimates based on trade and
production data that EU27 citizens consumed an average 15kg of textile
products per person per year. The European Commission wants to reduce
the impact of fast fashion on EU market (ERR, 2022). (Millward-Hopkins
et al., 2023) shows how 50% of the textile waste in the UK is exported
to other countries.

“26 million tons of clothing end up in China’s landfills each year,
propelled by fast fashion” (Tian Macleod Ji, 2024).

Greenwashing is prevalent in the fashion industry. **Problem**: Emily
Chan (2022a) report says there’s not enough transparency in fashion.
Fashion Revolution Foundation (2022) Fashion transparency index.
(Wikirate, 2022b): “Among the Index’s main goals are to help different
stakeholders to better understand what data and information is being
disclosed by the world’s largest fashion brands and retailers, raise
public awareness, educate citizens about the social and environmental
challenges facing the global fashion industry and support people’s
activism”. Consumer understanding of sustainability is limited. Mabuza
et al. (2023) shows consumer knowledge of apparel coloration is very
limited.

2.4 Trillion USD fashion industry contributing 2%-8% of total global GHG
emissions, 100B USD lost to lack of recycling, contributes 9% of
microplastics (Adamkiewicz et al., 2022). (Centobelli et al., 2022)
Fashion industry year uses 9B cubic meters of water, 1.7B tonnes of
CO<sub>2</sub>, 92 million tonnes of textile waste. Köhler et al. (2021)
Globally 87% of textile products are burned or landfilled after 1st
consumer use.

Towards Sustainable Clothes

-   There are local policy initiatives aiming to tackle the waste
    problem. For example the New Standard Institute’s proposed “Fashion
    Act” to require brands doing business in New York City to disclose
    sustainability data and set waste reduction targets (Emily Chan,
    2022b) .

-   (Leung & Luximon, 2021) There’s a growing know-how on how to produce
    sustainably and which materials to use. “Handbook of Footwear Design
    and Manufacture” Chapter 18 - Green design. Industry collaboration
    can raise the bar for everyone, such as the Better Cotton Initiative
    (Better Cotton, 2023).

-   Story of Patagonia (Chouinard, 2005)\].

Sustainable Fashion, Textile Design

-   There are signs of young Chinese consumers valuing experiences over
    possessions (Y. Jiang, 2023).

Across industries, reports are saying there isn’t enough transparency.

-   (Hannah Ritchie, 2020; US EPA, 2016) GHG emission inventory by
    sector

-   Marrucci et al. (2020) Italian retail supermarkets carbon footprint?

### Case: Food

Re-designing industrial food systems for an increasing global population
is a challenge. Supply chain innovation in food industries may enable
more transparency. **provenance and traceability of food has
implications for sustainability and health.**

Global warming leading to droughts and extreme weather, wars and
conflicts increased volatility in food prices (Eshe Nelson et al.,
2023).

“The agricultural sector contributes to approximately 13.5% of the total
global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and accounts for 25% of
the total CO<sub>2</sub> emission” (Nabipour Afrouzi et al., 2023).
Poore & Nemecek (2018) suggests 26% of carbon emissions come from food
production. Saner et al. (2015) reports dairy (46%) and meat and fish
(29%) products making up the largest GHG emission potential. Springmann
et al. (2021) proposes veganism is the most effective decision to reduce
personal CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.

*Farm to Fork* is a European Union policy to shorten the supply chain
from the producer to the consumer and add transparency to the system. A.
S. Patel et al. (2023) livestock products (meat) are 15% of agricultural
foods valued at €152 billion in 2018 globally.

-   Farm to Fork Financial Times (2022)

-   Fake honey, DNA-analysis to find real honey, synthetic honey can

-   China is the largest honey producer.

-   Food fraud

“Sustainability Intelligence for Food Companies” (n.d.)

*Open Food Facts - World* (n.d.) app for nutrition and sustainability
data

**Fishing**

-   75% of fishing is done using industrial Trawling, which has
    environmental impact

-   J. L. Bailey & Eggereide (2020) shows how the Norwegian government
    plans to increase salmon production 5x by 2050. How can this be
    sustainable? Mostly this means fish-farming

-   Complex supply chains make seafood (marine Bivalvia, mollusks)
    logistics prone to fraud, leading to financial losses and threats to
    consumer health (Santos et al., 2023). (C.-H. Chang et al., 2021)
    *fish fraud* is a large global problem but it’s possible to use
    DNA-tracking to prove where the fish came from. In “2019, the 27
    KURA SUSHI branches in Taiwan sold more than 46 million plates of
    sushi. in Taiwan”. Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IIU)
    fishing is widespread; the EU is adopting countermeasures (D. E. Kim
    & Lim, 2024). Muñoz et al. (2023) Is there such a thing as
    sustainable fishing? Bottom trawling is the worst and should be
    banned. Katie Gustafson (2022) proposes a **“Uniform traceability
    system for the entire supply chain”** for seafood. Mamede et
    al. (2022) proposes *Seafood tracing*: Fingerprinting of Sea Urchin.

-   The same is true for cocoa beans, which are at risk from food fraud
    (E. Fanning et al., 2023).

-   **Perennial Crops,** Multi-year crops reduce inputs of gasoline,
    labor, etc. (Aubrey Streit Krug & Yin Lu, 2023). Large agritech
    companies like Monsanto rely on selling seeds annually for profits
    putting them at odds with **Perennial crops**. Single-year seeds
    have led to farmer suicides when crops fail in poor communities.

### Circular Design

Circular design is only possible if supply chains become circular as
well.

It’s important in which structure data is stored, affecting the ability
to efficiently access and manage the data while guaranteeing a high
level of data integrity, security, as well as energy usage of said data.

The complexity of resource and delivery networks necessitates more
advanced tools to map supply chains (Knight et al., 2022). The COVID19
pandemic and resulting blockages in resource delivery highlighted the
need to have real-time visibility into supply chains (Finkenstadt &
Handfield, 2021).

Blockchains are a type of shared database where the data is stored in
several locations with a focus on making the data secure and very
difficult to modify after it’s been written to the database. Once data
is written to the blockchain, modifying it would require changing all
subsequent records in the chain and agreement of the majority of
validators who host a version of the database. Blockchain is the main
technology considered for accounting for the various inputs and complex
web of interactions between many participants inside the supply chain
networks. There are hundreds of paper researching blockchain use in
supply change operations since 2017 (Dutta et al., 2020). Blockchains
enable saving immutable records into distributed databases (also known
as ledgers). It’s not possible to (or extremely difficult) to change the
same record, only new records can be added on top of new ones.
Blockchains are useful for data sharing and auditing, as the time and
place of data input can be guaranteed, and it will be easier to conduct
a search on who inputted incorrect data; however the system still relies
on correct data input. As the saying goes, *“garbage in, garbage out”*.

There are several technologies for tracking goods across the supply
chain, from shipping to client delivery. Data entry is a combination of
manual data input and automated record-keeping facilitated by sensors
and integrated internet of things (IoT) capabilities. For example
(Ashraf & Heavey, 2023) describes using the Solana blockchain and Sigfox
internet of things (IoT) Integration for supply chain traceability where
Sigfox does not need direct access to internet but can send low powered
messages across long distances (for example shipping containers on the
ocean). (Van Wassenaer et al., 2023) compares use cases for blockchains
in enhancing traceability, transparency and cleaning up the supply chain
in agricultural products.

**Tracking Transport Supply Chains**

Products are made from resources distributed across the planet and
transported to clients around the world which currently causes high
levels (and increasing) of greenhouse gases. *“Transport greenhouse gas
emissions have increased every year since 2014”* (*Climate Change
Mitigation*, 2023). Freight (transport of goods by trucks, trains,
planes, ships) accounts for 1.14 gigatons of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions as
per 2015 data or 16% of total international supply chain emissions
(Yuqing Wang et al., 2022).

### Extended Producer Responsibility

Extended Producer Responsibility Enables Companies to be Resposible.

Popular blogs such as (Kohli, 2019) and (Lose, 2023) offer many
suggestions how designers can help people become more sustainable in
their daily lives yet focusing on the end-user neglects the producers’
responsibility (termed as Extended Producer Responsibility or ERP) in
waste management studies.

Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is a policy tool first proposed
by Thomas Lindhqvist in Sweden in 1990 \[ADD CITATION\], aimed to
encourage producers take responsibility for the entire life-cycle of
their products, thus leading to more eco-friendly products. Nonetheless,
EPR schemes do not guarantee circularity and may instead be designed
around fees to finance waste management in linear economy models
(Christiansen et al., 2021). The French EPR scheme was upgraded in 2020
to become more circular (Jacques Vernier, 2021). In July 2024, Latvia
was the 4th EU country to join an textile-EPR scheme (“New EPR
Requirements for Textiles in Latvia from July 2024 On,” 2024).

In any case, strong consumer legislation (such as EPR) has a direct
influence on producers’ actions. For example, in HKTDC Research (2022),
the Hong Kong Trade Development Council notified textile producers in
July 2022 reminding factories to produce to French standards in order to
be able enter the EU market. J. Peng et al. (2023) finds that the
***Carbon Disclosure Project*** has been a crucial tool to empower ERP
in Chinese auto-producers.

-   The success of EPR can vary per type of product. For car tires, the
    EPR scheme in the Netherlands claims a 100% recovery rate
    Campbell-Johnston et al. (2020).

One type of legislation that works?

-   (Steenmans & Ulfbeck, 2023) Argues for the need to engage companies
    through legislation and shift from waste-centered laws to product
    design regulations.

-   In Europe, there’s large variance between member states when in
    comes to textile recycling: while Estonia and France are the only EU
    countries where separate collection of textiles is required by law,
    in Estonia 100% of the textiles were burned in an incinerator in
    2018 while in France textiles are covered by an Extended Producer
    Responsibility (EPR) scheme leading to higher recovery rates (Ibid).

### Digital Product Passports

Even though this topic belongs under Circular Economy, I’ve chose to
highlight *digital product passports* here as it’s the main design
implication from this chapter - an emerging technology which needs to be
designed for the user.

I will being with a bit of history to contextualize what has already
been tried. CO<sub>2e</sub> labeling initiatives are an early form of
communicating the environmental cost of each product. Using carbon
labels to communicate CO<sub>2e</sub> emission of consumer products has
been a topic of discussion for decades (Adam Corner, 2012). Academic
literature has looked at minute details such as color and positioning of
the label (S. Zhou et al., 2019). There’s some indication consumers are
willing to pay a small premium for low-CO<sub>2e</sub> products; all
else being equal, consumers choose the option with a lower
CO<sub>2e</sub> number (Carlsson et al., 2022; M. Xu & Lin, 2022).
(Cohen & Vandenbergh, 2012) argues labeling the carbon footprint of
products does help inform consumer choice towards sustainability and
help promote a green economy. A large-scale study of UK university
students finds some evidence to suggest labeling low CO<sub>2e</sub>
food enables people to choose a *climatarian diet*, however the impact
of carbon labels on the market share of low-carbon meals is negligible
(Lohmann et al., 2022).

Labels alone are not enough. A study in Sweden underlines a negative
correlation between worrying about climate impact and interest in
climate information on products (Edenbrandt & Lagerkvist, 2022). This
latter finding may be interpreted to suggest a need for wider
environmental education programs among consumers. (Asioli et al., 2022)
found differences between countries, where Spanish and British consumers
chose meat products with *‘No antibiotics ever’* over a *Carbon Trust*
label, whereas French consumers chose CO<sub>2</sub> labeled meat
products.

however several studies show their effect is negligible. Nonetheless,
the idea of *Carbon Labelling* is yet to find mainstream adoption.

Carbon labeling is voluntary. Only a handful of companies practice
carbon-labeling but the number is growing. The U.S. restaurant chain
*Just Salad* , U.K.-based vegan meat-alternative *Quorn* and plant milk
*Oatly* are some example of companies that provide carbon labeling on
their products (Brian Kateman, 2020). (ClimatePartner, 2020): Companies
like ClimatePartner and Carbon Calories offers labeling consumer goods
with emission data as a service. (The Carbon Trust, n.d.): The Carbon
Trust reports it’s certified 27 thousand product footprints.

    Products Regulation (part of the Sustainable Products Initiative)
    and one of the key actions under the Circular Economy Action Plan

## Human Patterns

The fact that AI systems work so well is proof that we live in a
measurable world. The world is filled with structures: nature, cultures,
languages, human interactions - all form intricate patterns. Computer
systems are increasingly capable in their ability copy these patterns
into computer models - known as machine learning. As of 2023, 97
zettabytes (and growing) of data was created in the world per year
(Soundarya Jayaraman, 2023). Big data is a basic requirement for
training AIs, enabling learning from the structures of the world with
increasing accuracy. Representations of the real world in digital models
enable humans to ask questions about the real-world structures and to
manipulate them to create synthetic experiments that may match the real
world (if the model is accurate enough). This can be used for generating
human-sounding language and realistic images, finding mechanisms for
novel medicines as well as understanding the fundamental functioning of
life on its deep physical and chemical level (No Priors: AI, Machine
Learning, Tech, & Startups, 2023).

In essence, Human Patterns Enable AIs. Already ninety years ago
(McCulloch & Pitts, 1943) proposed the first mathematical model of a
neural network inspired by the human brain. Alan Turing’s Test for
Machine Intelligence followed in 1950. Turing’s initial idea was to
design a game of imitation to test human-computer interaction using text
messages between a human and 2 other participants, one of which was a
human, and the other - a computer. The question was, if the human was
simultaneously speaking to another human and a machine, could the
messages from the machine be clearly distinguished or would they
resemble a human being so much, that the person asking questions would
be deceived, unable to realize which one is the human and which one is
the machine? (Turing, 1950).

> Alan Turing: *“I believe that in about fifty years’ time it will be
> possible to program computers, with a storage capacity of about
> 10<sup>9</sup>, to make them play the imitation game so well that an
> average interrogator will not have more than 70 percent chance of
> making the right identification after five minutes of questioning. … I
> believe that at the end of the century the use of words and general
> educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able to
> speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted.”* -
> from (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 2021)

By the 2010s AI models became capable enough to beat humans in games of
Go and Chess, yet they did not yet pass the Turing test. AI use was
limited to specific tasks. While over the years, the field of AI had
seen a long process of incremental improvements, developing increasingly
advanced models of decision-making, it took an ***increase in computing
power*** and an approach called ***deep learning***, a variation of
***machine learning (1980s),*** largely modeled after the ***neural
networks*** of the biological (human) brain, returning to the idea of
***biomimicry***, inspired by nature, building a machine to resemble the
connections between neurons, but digitally, on layers much deeper than
attempted before.

use cases for AI” Pokrass (2024) How can AI interfaces

Sustainability)

### Human Feedback

Combining deep learning and *reinforcement learning with human feedback
(RLHF)* enabled to achieve levels of intelligence high enough to beat
the Turing test (Christiano et al., 2017; Christiano, 2021; Kara Manke,
2022). John Schulman, a co-founder of OpenAI describes RLHF simply:
*“the models are just trained to produce a single message that gets high
approval from a human reader”* (Kara Manke, 2022).

The nature-inspired approach was successful. Innovations such as
*back-propagation* for reducing errors through updating model weights
and *transformers* for tracking relationships in sequential data (for
example in sentences), enabled AI models to became increasingly capable
(Merritt, 2022; Vaswani et al., 2017). Generative Adversarial
Networks\*\*\* (GAN), (**ADD CITATION, 2016**), and ***Large Language
Models (*ADD CITATION*, 2018)***, enabled increasingly generalized
models, capable of more complex tasks, such as language generation. One
of the leading scientists in this field of research, Geoffrey Hinton,
had attempted back-propagation already in the 1980s and reminiscents how
*“the only reason neural networks didn’t work in the 1980s was because
we didn’t have have enough data and we didn’t have enough computing
power”* (CBS Mornings, 2023). (Epoch AI, 2024) reports the growth in
computing power and the evolution of more than 800 AI models since the
1950s. Very simply, more data and more computing power means more
intelligent models.

By the 2020s, AI-based models became a mainstay in medical research,
drug development, patient care (Holzinger et al., 2023; Leite et al.,
2021), quickly finding potential vaccine candidates during the COVID19
pandemic (Zafar & Ahamed, 2022), self-driving vehicles, including cars,
delivery robots, drones in the sea and air, as well as AI-based
assistants. The existence of AI models has wide implications for all
human activities from personal to professional. The founder of the
largest chimp-maker NVIDIA calls upon all countries do develop their own
AI-models which would encode their local knowledge, culture, and
language to make sure these are accurately captured (World Governments
Summit, 2024).

OpenAI has researched a wide range of approaches towards artificial
general intelligence (AGI), work which has led to advances in large
language models(AI Frontiers, 2018; Ilya Sutskever, 2018). In 2020
OpenAI released a LLM called GPT-3 trained on 570 GB of text (Alex
Tamkin & Deep Ganguli, 2021) which was adept in text-generation. (Singer
et al., 2022) describes how collecting billions of images with
descriptive data (for example the descriptive *alt* text which
accompanies images on websites) enabled researchers to train AI models
such as ***stable diffusion*** for image-generation based on
human-language. These training make use of *Deep Learning*, a layered
approach to AI training, where increasing depth of the computer model
captures minute details of the world. Much is still to be understood
about how deep learning works; even for specialists, the fractal
structure of deep learning can only be called *mysterious*
(Sohl-Dickstein, 2024).

AI responses are probabilistic and need some function for ranking
response quality. Achieving higher percentage or correct responses
requires oversight which can come in the form of human feedback or by
using other AIs systems which are deemed to be already well-aligned
(termed Constitutional AI by Anthropic) (Bai et al., 2022; J. Bailey,
2023). Less powerful AIs areFor example META used LLAMA 2 for aligning
LLAMA 3.

One approach to reduce the issues with AI is to introduce some function
for human feedback and oversight to automated systems. Human involvement
can take the form of interventions from the AI-developer themselves as
well as from the end-users of the AI system.

There are many examples of combination of AI and human, also known as
*“human-in-the-loop”,* used for fields as diverse as training computer
vision algorithms for self-driving cars and detection of disinformation
in social media posts (Bonet-Jover et al., 2023; J. Wu et al., 2023).

### The Idiot Savant

Hinton likes to call AI an *idiot savant*: someone with exceptional
aptitude yet serious mental disorder (CBS Mornings, 2023). Large AI
models don’t understand the world like humans do. Their responses are
predictions based on their training data and complex statistics. Indeed,
the comparison is apt, as the AI field now offers jobs for *AI
psychologists (ADD CITATION)*, whose role is to figure out what exactly
is happening inside the ‘AI brain’. Understading the insides of AI
models trained of massive amounts of data is important because they are
*foundational*, enabling a holistic approach to learning, combining many
disciplines using languages, instead of the reductionist way we as human
think because of our limitations (CapInstitute, 2023).

Standford “thorough account of the opportunities and risks of foundation
models” (Bommasani et al., 2021).

Foundation models in turn enabled *generative AIs*, a class of models
which are able to generate many types of *tokens**,*** such as text,
speech, audio (Kreuk et al., 2022; San Roman et al., 2023), music (Copet
et al., 2023; Meta AI, 2023), video, and even complex structures such 3D
models and DNA structures, in any language it’s trained on. The advent
of generative AIs was a revolution in human-computer interaction as AI
models became increasingly capable of producing human-like content which
is hard to distinguish from actual human creations. This power comes
with *increased need for responsibility*, drawing growing interest in
fields like *AI ethics* and *AI explainability.* Generative has a
potential for misuse, as humans are increasingly confused by what is
computer-generated and what is human-created, unable to separate one
from the other with certainty.

The technological leap is great enough for people to start calling it a
start of a new era.(Noble et al., 2022) proposes AI has reached a stage
of development marking beginning of the *5th industrial revolution*, a
time of collaboration between humans and AI. Widespread Internet of
Things (IoT) sensor networks that gather data analyzed by AI algorithms,
integrates computing even deeper into the fabric of daily human
existence. Several terms of different origin but considerable overlap
describe this phenomenon, including *Pervasive Computing (PC)* (Y.
Rogers, 2022) and *Ubiquitous Computing*. Similar concepts are *Ambient
Computing*, which focuses more on the invisibility of technology, fading
into the background, without us, humans, even noticing it, and *Calm
Technology*, which highlights how technology respects humans and our
limited attention spans, and doesn’t call attention to itself. In all
cases, AI is integral part of our everyday life, inside everything and
everywhere. Today AI is not an academic concept but a mainstream
reality, affecting our daily lives everywhere, even when we don’t notice
it.

### Algorithmic Transparency: Before AIs

Before AIs, as a user of social media, one may be accustomed to
interacting with the feed algorithms that provide a personalized
*algorithmic experience*. Social media user feed algorithms are more
*deterministic* than AI, meaning they would produce more predictable
output in comparison AI models. Nonetheless, there are many reports
about effects these algorithms have on human psychology **(ADD
CITATION)**.

Design is increasingly relevant to algorithms, - *algorithm design* -
and more specifically to algorithms that affect user experience and user
interfaces. ***When the design is concerned with the ethical,
environmental, socioeconomic, resource-saving, and participatory aspects
of human-machine interactions and aims to affect technology in a more
human direction, it can hope to create an experience designed for
sustainability.***

Lorenzo et al. (2015) underlines the role of design beyond *designing*
as a tool for envisioning; in her words, *“design can set agendas and
not necessarily be in service, but be used to find ways to explore our
world and how we want it to be”*. Practitioners of Participatory Design
(PD) have for decades advocated for designers to become more activist
through ***action research***. This means to influencing outcomes, not
only being a passive observer of phenomena as a researcher, or only
focusing on usability as a designer, without taking into account the
wider context.

Shenoi (2018) argues inviting domain expertise into the discussion while
having a sustainable design process enables designers to design for
experiences where they are not a domain expert; this applies to highly
technical fields, such as medicine, education, governance, and in our
case here - finance and sustainability -, while building respectful
dialogue through participatory design. After many years of political
outcry (ADD CITATION), social media platforms such Meta Facebook and
Twitter (later renamed to X) have begun to shed more light on how these
algorithms work, in some cases releasing the source code (Nick Clegg,
2023; Twitter, 2023).

The content on the platform can be more important than the interface.
Applications with a similar UI depend on the community as well as the
content and how the content is shown to the user.

### Transitioning to Complexity: Non-Deterministic Systems

AIs are non-deterministic, which requires a new set of consideration
when designing AI.

AI systems may make use of several algorithms within one larger model.
It follows that AI Explainability requires ***Algorithmic
Transparency**.*

### Being Responsible, Explainable, and Safe

The problems of opaqueness creates the field of explainable AI.

*“As humans we tend to fear what we don’t understand”* is a common
sentiment which has been confirmed psychology (Allport, 1979). Current
AI-models are opaque ’*black boxes’*, where it’s difficult to pin-point
exactly why a certain decision was made or how a certain expression was
reached, not unlike inside the human brain. This line of thought leads
me to the idea of ***AI psychologists,*** who might figure out the
***thought patterns*** inside the model. Research in AI-explainability
(XAI in literature) is on the lookout for ways to create more
***transparency and credibility*** in AI systems, which could lead to
building trust in AI systems and would form the foundations for ***AI
acceptance***.

Red-teaming means pushing the limits of LLMs, trying to get them to
produce outputs that are racist, false, or otherwise unhelpful.

There’s an increasing number of tools for LLM evaluation:

-   “Evaluate and Track LLM Applications, Explainability for Neural
    Networks” (Leino et al., 2018; TruEra, 2023)

-   “evaluate your Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines,
    Metrics-Driven Development” Ragas (2023)

-   LangSmith “developer platform for every step of the LLM-powered
    application lifecycle, whether you’re building with LangChain or
    not. Debug, collaborate, test, and monitor your LLM applications.”
    LangChain (2024)

-   Tristan Greene (2022): when the quality of AI responses becomes good
    enough, people begin to get confused.

Bowman (2023) says steering Large Language Models is unreliable; even
experts don’t fully understand the inner workings of the models. Work
towards improving both ***AI steerability*** and ***AI alignment***
(doing what humans expect) is ongoing. Liang et al. (2022) believes
there’s early evidence it’s possible to assess the quality of LLM output
transparently. Cabitza et al. (2023) proposes a framework for quality
criteria and explainability of AI-expressions. Khosravi et al. (2022)
proposes a framework for AI explainability, focused squarely on
education. Holzinger et al. (2021) highlights possible approaches to
implementing transparency and explainability in AI models. While AI
outperforms humans on many tasks, humans are experts in multi-modal
thinking, bridging diverse fields.

-   Bigger models aren’t necessarily better; rather models need human
    feedback to improve the quality of responses Ouyang et al. (2022)

-   The user experience (UX) of AI is a topic under active development
    by all the largest online platforms. The general public is familiar
    with the most famous AI helpers, ChatGPT, Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s
    Alexa, Microsoft’s Cortana, Google’s Assistant, Alibaba’s Genie,
    Xiaomi’s Xiao Ai, and many others. For general, everyday tasks, such
    as asking factual questions, controlling home devices, playing
    media, making orders, and navigating the smart city.

-   G. Zhang et al. (2023) found humans are more likely to trust an AI
    teammate if they are not deceived by it’s identity. It’s better for
    collaboration to make it clear, one is talking to a machine. One
    step towards trust is the explainability of AI-systems.

Responsible AI Seeks to Mitigate Generative AIs’ Known Issues.

Given the widespread use of AI and its increasing power of foundational
models, it’s important these systems are created in a safe and
responsible manner. While there have been calls to pause the development
of large AI experiments (Future of Life Institute, 2023) so the world
could catch up, this is unlikely to happen. There are several problems
with the current generation of LLMs from OpenAI, Microsoft, Google,
Nvidia, and others.

Anthropic responsible *scaling policy* (*Anthropic’s Responsible Scaling
Policy*, 2023)

METR – Model Evaluation & Threat Research incubated in the Alignment
Research Center (*METR*, 2023).

(Christiano, 2023) believes there are plenty of ways for bad outcomes
(existential risk) even without extinction risk.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[44] }} />

In 2024, OpenAI released its “Model Spec” to define clearly their
approach to AI safety with the stated intention to provide clear
guidelines for the RLHF approach. OpenAI (2024c)

-   OpenAI does not yet understand how the internal of an neural network
    work; they are developing tools to represent NNs concepts for humans
    (L. Gao et al., 2024; OpenAI, 2024a).

-   AI co-founder launches AI Safety Superalignment (Jan Leike & Ilya
    Sutskever, 2023).

-   OECD defines AI incident terms *Defining AI Incidents and Related
    Terms* (2024)

-   Foundation data-sets such as LAION-5B (Romain Beaumont, 2022;
    Schuhmann et al., 2022)

-   Knowing Machines

*AI acceptance* is incumbent on traits that are increasingly human-like
and would make a human be acceptable: credibility, trustworthiness,
reliability, dependability, integrity, character, etc.

### Evolution of Models and Emerging Abilities

Mapping the emerging abilities of new models.

The debate between Open Source v.s. Closed-Source AI is ongoing.
Historically open-source has been useful for finding bugs in code as
more pairs of eyes are looking at the code and someone may see a problem
the programmers have not noticed. Proponents of closed-source
development however worry about the dangers or releasing such powerful
technology openly and the possibility of bad actors such as terrorists,
hackers, violent governments using LLMs for malice. The question whether
closed-sourced or open-sourced development will be lead to more AI
safety is one of the large debates in the AI industry. In any case, open
or closed-sourced, real-world usage of LLMs may demonstrate the
limitations and edge-cases of AI. Hackathons such as (Pete, 2023) help
come up with new use-cases and disprove some potential ideas.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[45] }} />

![](_thesis_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-40-output-1.png)

The proliferation of different models enables comparisons of performance
based on several metrics from accuracy of responses to standardized
tests such as GMAT usually taken my humans to reasoning about less well
defined problem spaces. (Chiang et al., 2024; lmsys.org, 2024)
open-source AI-leaderboard project has collected over 500 thousand
human-ranking of outputs from 82 large-language models, evaluating
reasoning capabilities, which currently rate GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus as
the top-performers. (Zellers et al., 2019)’s HellaSwag paper is also
accompanied by a leaderboard website (still being updated after
publication) listing AI model performance most recent entry April 16,
2024).

-   Scaling laws of LLMs Kaplan et al. (2020)

-   English is over-represented in current models so Finnish “Silo AI’s
    New Release Viking 7B, Bridges the Gap for Low-Resource
    Languages” (2024) focuses on Nordic languages.

zero waste workshop training guidebook.

-   complex decision-making systems. Apple’s Foundation Language Models
    (AFM) is split into a smaller on-device model and a server-side
    model. Dang (2024)

Metacognition defined as *knowing about knowing* (J. Metcalfe &
Shimamura, 1994) or “*keeping track of your own learning”* (Zero Waste
Europe et al., 2022).

-   Dwarkesh Patel (2024) META open-sourced the largest language model
    (70 billion parameters) which with performance rivaling several of
    the proprietary models.

-   Image-generation is now fast it’s possible to create images in
    real-time while the user is typing Dwarkesh Patel (2024)

-   Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) Hendrycks
    et al. (2020).

Another important metric is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
performance. Generative AI applications retrieve data from unstructured
external sources in order to augment LLMs existing knowledge with
current information (Leng et al., Mon, 08/12/2024 - 19:46).

## Price of Tokens

At the end of the day, the adoption of AI to everyday life, even in the
smallest of contexts, will come down to the price. Long-time AI-engineer
(Ng, 2024) predicts, having seen the roadmaps for the microchip
industries, as well as incoming hardware and software innovations, the
price of tokens will be very low, and much lower than a comparative
human worker.

## Companions

## Acceptance

### Human Expectations Take Time to Change

Humans still need some time to adjust their expectations of *what’s
possible* using conversational AI interfaces. (J. Bailey, 2023) believes
people are used to *search engines* and it will take a little bit time
to get familiar with talking to a computer in natural language to
accomplish their tasks. For example, new users of v0, an AI assistant
for building user interfaces through conversation, would tell humans
(the company make this app) about the issues they encounter, instead of
telling the AI assistant directly, even though the AI in many cases
would be able to fix the problem instantly; human users don’t yet
necessarily expect computers to behave like another human, there’s
*inertia* in the mental model of what computers are capable of,
requiring the user interfaces to provide context and teaching humans how
to interact with their AI coworkers(Rauch, 2024). Indeed, ChatGPT is
already using buttons to explain context (Feifei Liu 刘菲菲, n.d.).

### Affective Computing Enables Friendly Machines

*Rosalind Picard* founded the field of *affective computing*, aiming to
make computers more human-friendly, pioneering early approaches to
recognizing human emotions with sensors and providing users experiences
that take human emotion into account (Picard, 1997).

It’s not an overstatement to say that data from all the processes around
us will define the future of computing (HIITTV, 2021). In the early
examples, electrodermal activity of the skin and heart-rate variance
data were used to detect the emotional state and stress level of the
user (Velmovitsky et al., 2022; Zangróniz et al., 2017). This technology
has since become mainstream in products such as Fitbit and the Apple
Watch, among many others.

*Personal experience:*

> Apple Watch features Fall Detection, which I’ve experienced
> personally. Riding my bicycle to the NCKU library after rain, I
> slipped and landed on my stomach on the pavement. Apple Watch
> immediately asked me: *“It looks like you’ve taken a hard fall”* and
> offered an option to call the ambulance. Fortunately I was OK but if I
> did need assistance, this AI algorithm delivered contextual help,
> which could save my health!

Affective computing doesn’t only rely on sensors. It make use of human
language using the tools of computational linguistics. such as natural
language processing (NLP). Since the first mainframe computers with
rudimentary ability to use pattern matching to respond with simple text
messages, humans have been drawn to discussions of our private lives
with machines. If programmed to be helpful, computers don’t necessarily
judge us like a human could. A famous anecdote is about the MIT ELIZA
project (an early examples of a language model) developed by Joseph
Weizenbaum in the mid-1960s, where the lab assistant Pamela McCorduck
would dedicate extended time to talking to the machine in private. The
machine was called ELIZA and would assume the persona of called DOCTOR
to emulate a Rogerian psychotherapist, a style of person-centered
therapy developed by Carl Rogers, from the core idea that positive
psychological functioning is a inherently human motivation (Bassett,
2019; McCorduck, 2004; C. R. Rogers, 1995).

An excerpt from the classic, first-of-a-kind conversation between a
human and a machine (called DOCTOR) in 1965, as documented by (Tarnoff,
2023; Weizenbaum, 1966)

> User: Well, my boyfriend made me come here.  
> DOCTOR: YOUR BOYFRIEND MADE YOU COME HERE?  
> User: He says I’m depressed much of the time.  
> DOCTOR: I AM SORRY TO HEAR YOU ARE DEPRESSED.  
> User: It’s true. I am unhappy.  
> DOCTOR: DO YOU THINK COMING HERE WILL HELP YOU NOT TO BE UNHAPPY?  
> User: I need some help, that much seems certain.  
> DOCTOR: WHAT WOULD IT MEAN TO YOU IF YOU GOT SOME HELP?  
> User: Perhaps I could learn to get along with my mother.  
> DOCTOR: TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR FAMILY.  
> User: My mother takes care of me.  
> DOCTOR: WHO ELSE IN YOUR FAMILY TAKES CARE OF YOU?  
> User: My father.  
> DOCTOR: YOUR FATHER?  
> User: You are like my father in some ways.  
> DOCTOR: WHAT RESEMBLANCE DO YOU SEE?

Weizenbaum later expressed concerns about how easily humans might be
misled by AIs, by projecting fantasies onto computer systems, cautioning
technologists not to neglect human responsibility from societal
problems; AI is *not* a universal solution (Z.M.L, 2023)

***Design Implications:*** AI companions could combine sensor data from
human bodies with the ability to reason about human speech, to provide
increasingly relevant, in-context assistance. Because of the
conversational nature of LLMs, they are very useful for affective
computing.

### Artificial Empathy Also Builds Trust

Today’s machines are much more capable so it’s not a surprise humans
would like to talk to them. One example is *AI Friend* is Replika, a
computer model trained to be your companion in daily life. (Q. Jiang et
al., 2022) describes how Replika users in China using in 5 main ways,
all of which rely on empathy. The company’s CEO insists it’s not trying
to replace human relationship but to create an entirely new relationship
category with the AI companion; there’s value for the users in more
realistic avatars, integrating the experience further into users’ daily
lives through various activities and interactions (N. Patel, 2024).

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[46] }} />

-   Google is developing an AI assistant for giving life advice Goswami
    (2023).
-   GPT-4 is able to solve difficult task in chemistry with
    natural-language instructions White (2023)
-   Emojis are a part of natural language Tay (2023)

Jakob Nielsen notes two recent studies suggesting human deem
AI-generated responses *more empathetic than human responses,* at times
by a significant margin; however telling users the response is
AI-generated reduces the perceived empathy (Ayers et al., 2023; Nielsen,
2024c; Yidan Yin et al., 2024).

(B. Liu & Wei, 2021) suggests higher *algorithmic transparency may
inhibit anthropomorphism*; people are less likely to attribute humanness
to an AI companion if they understand how the system works.

On the output side, (Lv et al., 2022) studies the effect of *cuteness*
of AI apps on users and found high perceived cuteness correlated with
higher willingness to use the apps, especially for emotional tasks.

### Conversation: Magical Starting Point of a Relationship

High quality conversations are somewhat magical in that they can
establish trust and build rapport which humans.

*Affective Design* emerged from affective computing, with a focus on
understanding user emotions to design UI/UX which elicits specific
emotional responses (Reynolds, 2001).

(Celino & Re Calegari, 2020) found in testing chatbots for survey
interfaces that “\[c\]onversational survey lead to an improved response
data quality.”

There are noticeable differences in the quality of the LLM output, which
increases with model size. (Levesque et al., 2012) developed the
*Winograd Schema Challenge*, looking to improve on the Turing test, by
requiring the AI to display an understanding of language and context.
The test consists of a story and a question, which has a different
meaning as the context changes: “The trophy would not fit in the brown
suitcase because it was too big” - what does the *it* refer to? Humans
are able to understand this from context while a computer models would
fail. Even GPT-3 still failed the test, but later LLMs have been able to
solve this test correctly (90% accuracy) Kocijan et al. (2022). This is
to say AI is in constant development and improving it’s ability to make
sense of language.

*ChatGPT* is the first *user interface (UI)* built on top of GPT-4 by
OpenAI and is able to communicate in a human-like way - using
first-person, making coherent sentences that sound plausible, and even -
confident and convincing. M. C. Wang Sarah (2023) ChatGPT reached 1
million users in 5 days and 6 months after launch has 230 million
monthly active users. While it was the first, competing offers from
Google (Gemini), Anthrophic (Claude), Meta (Llama) and others quickly
followed starting a race for best performance across specific tasks
including standardized tests from math to science to general knowledge
and reasoning abilities.

OpenAI provides AI-as-a-service through its *application programming
interfaces (APIs),* allowing 3rd party developers to build custom UIs to
serve the specific needs of their customer. For example Snapchat has
created a *virtual friend* called “My AI” who lives inside the chat
section of the Snapchat app and helps people write faster with
predictive text completion and answering questions. The APIs make
state-of-the-art AI models easy to use without needing much technical
knowledge. Teams at AI-hackathons have produced interfaces for problems
as diverse as humanitarian crises communication, briefing generation,
code-completion, and many others. For instance, (Unleash, 2017) used BJ
Fogg’s *tiny habits model* to develop a sustainability-focused AI
assistant at the Danish hackathon series Unleash, to encourage
behavioral changes towards maintaining an aspirational lifestyle, nudged
by a chatbot buddy.

ChatGPT makes it possible to *evaluate AI models* just by talking,
i.e. having conversations with the machine and judging the output with
some sort of structured content analysis tools. Cahan & Treutlein (2023)
have conversations about science with AI. Pavlik (2023) and Brent A.
Anders (2022/2023) report on AI in education. (Kecht et al., 2023)\]
suggests AI is even capable of learning business processes.

-   Fu et al. (2022) Learning towards conversational AI: Survey

### Multi-Modality: Natural Interactions with AI Systems

Humans are multi-modal creatures by birth. To varied ability, we speak,
see, listen using our biological bodies. AIs are becoming multi-modal by
design to be able to match all the human modes of communication -
increasing their humanity.

By early 2024, widely available LLMs front-ends such as Gemini, Claude
and ChatGPT have all released basic features for multi-modal
communication. In practice, this means combination several AI models
within the same interface. For example, on the input side, one model is
used for human speech or image recognition which are transcribed into
tokens that can be ingested into an LLM. On the output side, the LLM can
generate instructions which are fed into an image / audio generation
model or even computer code which can be ran on a virtual machine and
then the output displayed inside the conversation.

The quality of LLM output depends on the quality of the provided prompt.
Y. Zhou et al. (2022) reports creating an “Automatic Prompt Engineer”
which automatically generates instructions that outperform the baseline
output quality by using another model in the AI pipeline in front of the
LLM to enhance the human input with language that is known to produce
better quality. This approach however is a moving target as foundational
models keep changing rapidly and the baseline might differ from today to
6 months later.

Multimodal model development is also ongoing. In the case of Google’s
Gemini 1.5 Pro, one model is able to handle several types of prompts
from text to images. Multimodal prompting however requires larger
context windows, as of writing, limited to 1 million tokens in a private
version allows combining text and images in the question directed to the
AI, used to reason in examples such as a 44-minute Buster Keaton silent
film or Apollo 11 launch transcript (404 pages) Google (2024).

Literature delves into human-AI interactions on almost human-like level
discussing what kind of roles can the AIs take. (Seeber et al., 2020)
proposes a future research agenda for regarding ***AI assistants as
teammates*** rather than just tools and the implications of such mindset
shift.

From Assistance to Collaboration

It’s not only what role the AI takes but how that affects the human. As
humans have ample experience relating to other humans and as such the
approach towards an assistants vs a teammate will vary. One researcher
in this field Karpus et al. (2021) is concerned with humans treating AI
badly and coins the term **“*algorithm exploitation”****.*

-   From assistant -\> teammate -\> companion -\> friend The best help
    for anxiety is a friend. AIs are able to assume different roles
    based on user requirements and usage context. This makes
    AI-generated content flexible and malleable.

Just as humans, AIs are continuously learning. Ramchurn et al. (2021)
discusses positive feedback loops in continually learning AI systems
which adapt to human needs.

*Context of Use,* Where is the AI used? (Schoonderwoerd et al., 2021)
focuses on human-centered design of AI-apps and multi-modal information
display. It’s important to understand the domain where the AI is
deployed in order to develop explanations. However, in the real world,
how feasible is it to have control over the domain? Calisto et al.
(2021) discusses **multi-modal AI-assistant** for breast cancer
classification.

### Mediated Experiences Set User Expectations

How AIs are represented in popular media shapes the way we think about
AI companions. Some stories have AIs both in positive and negative
roles, such as Star Trek and Knight Rider. In some cases like Her and Ex
Machina, the characters may be complex and ambivalent rather than
fitting into a simple positive or negative box. In Isaac Asimov’s books,
the AIs (mostly in robot form) struggle with the 3 laws of robotics,
raising thought-provoking questions.

AI Assistants in Media Portrayals mostly have some level of
anthropomorphism through voice or image to be able to film; indeed, a
purely text-based representation may be too boring an un-cinematic.

There have been dozens of AI-characters in the movies, TV-series, games,
and (comic) books. In most cases, they have a physical presence or a
voice, so they could be visible for the viewers. Some include KITT
(Knight Industries Two Thousand).

### Roleplay Fits Computers Into Social Contexts

Should AIs be required to disclose they are AIs?

AI Friends and Roleplay (Anthropomorphic)

Calling a machine a friend is a proposal bound to turn heads. But if we
take a step back and think about how children have been playing with
toys since before we have records of history. It’s very common for
children to imagine stories and characters in play - it’s a way to
develop one’s imagination ***learn through roleplay***. A child might
have toys with human names and an imaginary friend and it all seems very
normal. Indeed, if a child doesn’t like to play with toys, we might
think something is wrong.

Likewise, inanimate objects with human form have had a role to play for
adults too. Anthropomorphic paddle dolls have been found from Egyptian
tombs dated 2000 years B.C. “Paddle Doll Middle Kingdom” (2023): We
don’t know if these dolls were for religious purposes, for play, or for
something else, yet their burial with the body underlines their
importance.

Coming back closer to our own time, Barbie dolls are popular since their
release in 1959 till today. Throughout the years, the doll would follow
changing social norms, but retain in human figure. In the 1990s, a
Tamagotchi is perhaps not a human-like friend but an animal-like friend,
who can interact in limited ways.

How are conversational AIs different from dolls? They can respond
coherently and perhaps that’s the issue - they are too much like humans
in their communication. We have crossed the ***Uncanny Valley*** (where
the computer-generated is nearly human and thus unsettling) to a place
where is really hard to tell a difference. And if that’s the case, are
we still playing?

Should the AI play a human, animal, or robot? Anthropomorphism can have
its drawbacks; humans have certain biases and preconceptions that can
affect human-computer interactions (Pilacinski et al., 2023) reports
humans were less likely to collaborate with red-eyed robots.

The AI startups like Inworld and Character.AI have raised large rounds
of funding to create characters, which can be plugged in into online
worlds, and more importantly, remember key facts about the player, such
as their likes and dislikes, to generate more natural-sounding dialogues
Wiggers (2023)

-   Lenharo (2023) experimental study reports AI productivity gains,
    DALL-E and ChatGPT are qualitatively better than former automation
    systems.

**Human-like**

Is anthropomorphism necessary? (Savings literature says it is)

As AIs became more expressive and able to to **roleplay**, we can begin
discussing some human-centric concepts and how people relate to other
people. AI companions, AI partners, AI assistants, AI trainers - there’s
are many **roles** for the automated systems that help humans in many
activities, powered by artificial intelligence models and algorithms.

-   RQ: Do college students prefer to talk to an Assistant, Friend,
    Companion, Coach, Trainer, or some other Role?

-   RQ: Are animal-like, human-like or machine-like AI companions more
    palatable to college students?

Humans (want to) see machines as human \[ADD CITATION\]

If we see the AI as being in human service. David Johnston (2023)
proposes ***Smart Agents***, “general purpose AI that acts according to
the goals of an individual human”. AI agents can enable ***Intention
Economy*** where one simply describes one’s needs and a complex
orchestration of services ensues, managed by the the AI, in order to
fulfill human needs Searls (2012). AI assistants provide help at scale
with little to no human intervention in a variety of fields from finance
to healthcare to logistics to customer support.

There is also the question of who takes responsibility for the actions
take by the AI agent. “Organization research suggests that acting
through human agents (i.e., the problem of indirect agency) can
undermine ethical forecasting such that actors believe they are acting
ethically, yet a) show less benevolence for the recipients of their
power, b) receive less blame for ethical lapses, and c) anticipate less
retribution for unethical behavior.” Gratch & Fast (2022)

    several studies have demonstrated the effect of anthropomorphism,
    few have probed the underlying mechanism of anthropomorphism

**Machine-like**

The Oxford Internet Institute defines AI simply as ***“computer
programming that learns and adapts”*** Google & The Oxford Internet
Institute (2022). Google started using AI in 2001, when a simple machine
learning model improved spelling mistakes while searching; now in 2023
most of Google’s products are are based on AI Google (2022). Throughout
Google’s services, AI is hidden and calls no attention itself. It’s
simply the complex system working behind the scenes to delivery a result
in a barebones interface.

The rising availability of AI assistants may displace Google search with
a more conversational user experience. Google itself is working on tools
that could cannibalize their search product. The examples include Google
Assistant, Google Gemini (previously known as Bard) and large
investments into LLMs.

Everything that existed before OpenAI’s GPT 4 has been blown out of the
water.

Pre-2023 literature is somewhat limited when it comes to AI companions
as the advantage of LLMs has significantly raised the bar for AI-advisor
abilities as well as user expectations.

## Interfaces

### Speech Makes Computers Feel Real

Voice has a visceral effect on the human psyche; since birth we
recognize the voice of our mother. The voice of a loved one has a
special effect. Voice is a integral part of the human experience.
Machines that can use voice in an effective way are closer to
representing and affecting human emotions.

Voice assistants such as Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa are well-known
examples of AI technology in the world. Amazon’s Rohit Prasad thinks it
can do so much more, “Alexa is not just an AI assistant – it’s a trusted
advisor and a companion” (Prasad, 2022).

-   LLMs combined with voice provide a unnerving user experience Ethan
    Mollick \[@emollick\] (2023)
-   Ethical issues: Voice assistants need to continuously record human
    speech and process it in data centers in the cloud.
-   Siri, Cortana, Google Assistant, Alexa, Tencent Dingdang, Baidu
    Xiaodu, Alibaba AliGenie all rely on voice only.
-   Szczuka et al. (2022) provides guidelines for Voice AI and kids

    Distraction?”
-   J. Tang et al. (2022) reports new findings enable computers to
    reconstruct language from fMRI readings. - Focus on voice education?

Some research suggests that voice UI accompanied by a *physical embodied
system* is the preffered by users in comparison with voice-only UI
(Celino & Re Calegari, 2020).

There’s evidence across disciplines about the usefulness of AI
assistants:

-   (Şerban & Todericiu, 2020) suggests using the Alexa AI assistant in
    *education* during the pandemic, supported students and teachers
    ‘human-like’ presence. Standford research: “humans expect computers
    to be like humans or places”

***Design Implications:*** This suggests adding an avatar to the AI
design may be worthwhile.

### Generative UIs Enable Flexibility of Use

The ‘grandfather’ of user experience design, (Nielsen, 2024a) recounts
how 30 years of work towards usability has largely failed - computers
are still not accessible enough (*“difficult, slow, and unpleasant”*) -
and has hope Generative UI could offer a chance to provide levels of
accessibility humans could not. The promise of *Generative User
Interfaces* (GenUI) is to dynamically provide an interface appropriate
for the particular user and context. The advances in the capabilities of
LLMs makes it possible to achieve *user experience (UX) which previously
was science fiction*. AI is able to predict what kind of UI would the
user need right now, based on the data and context. Generative UIs are
largely invented in practice, based on user data analysis and
experimentation, rather than being built in theory. Kelly Dern, a Senior
Product Designer at Google lead a workshop in early 2024 on *GenUI for
product inclusion* aiming to create ***“**more accessible and inclusive
\[UIs for\] users of all backgrounds**”.*** (Matteo Sciortino, 2024)
coins the phrase RTAG UIs *“real-time automatically-generated UI
interfaces”* mainly drawing from the example of how his Netflix
interface looks different from that of his sister’s because of their
distinct usage patterns.

-   Meanwhile (Fletcher, 2023) and (Joe Blair, 2024) are worried about
    UIs becoming average: more and more similar to the lowest common
    denominator. We can generate better UIs that are based on user data
    and would be truly personalized.

Software itself can increasingly be generated by AI systems
(i.e. machines making machines). As machines become more capable,
machines will eventually be capable of producing machines. Already a
decade ago in 2014, the eminent journal *Information Sciences* decided
to dedicate a special section to AI-generated software to call attention
to this tectonic shift in software development (Reformat, 2014). Replit,
a startup known for allowing user build apps in the web browser,
released Openv0, a framework of AI-generated UI components. *“Components
are the foundation upon which user interfaces (UI) are built, and
generative AI is unlocking component creation for front-end developers,
transforming a once arduous process, and aiding them in swiftly
transitioning from idea to working components”* (Replit, 2023). Vercel
introduced an open-source prototype UI-generator called V0 which used
large language models (LLMs) to create code for web pages based on text
prompts (Vercel, 2023). Other similar tools quickly following including
Galileo AI, Uizard AutoDesigner and Visily (*Who Benefits the Most from
Generative UI*, 2024). NVIDIA founder Jensen Huang makes the idea
exceedingly clear, saying *“Everyone is a programmer. Now, you just have
to say something to the computer”* (Leswing, 2023).

The history of *intelligent interfaces* is long (Kobetz, 2023).
(“Generative UI Design,” 2023) gives an overview of the history of
generative AI design tools going back in time until 2012 when (Troiano &
Birtolo, 2014) proposed genetic algorithms for UI design.

There’s wide literature available describing human-AI interactions
across varied scientific disciplines. While the fields of application
are diverse, some key lessons can be transferred horizontally across
fields of knowledge.

interaction. Mikael Eriksson Björling & Ahmed H. Ali (n.d.) Ericcson AI
UX.

-   

McKeough (2018) business consultancies have begun to recognize the
importance of design to business. They advise their corporate clients to
bring user experience design to the core of their business operations.

There’s a number of user interface design patterns that have provide
successful across a range of social media apps. Such *user experience /
user interface* (UX/UI) patterns are copied from one app to another, to
the extent that the largest apps share a similar look and feature set.
Common UX/UI parts include the Feed and Stories. By using common UI
parts from social media users have an easier time to accept the
innovative parts. add Viz charts. Avatars are increasingly common and
new generations are used to talking to computers.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[51] }} />

There are also more philosophical approaches to ***Interface Studies:***
David Hoang (2022), the head of product design at Webflow, suggests
taking cues from art studies to ***isolate the core problem***: *“An art
study is any action done with the intention of learning about the
subject you want to draw”*. As a former art student, Hoang looks at an
interface as *“a piece of design is an artwork with function”*.

Indeed, art can be a way to see new paths forward, practicing
“*fictioning*” to deal with problematic legacies: “Review of the 2023
Helsinki Biennial” (2023)

Usability sets the baseline but AI-interfaces are capable of more.

-   AI is usually a model that spits out a number between 0 and 1, a

    capabilities through UIs that are specific to a task rather than
    generalist interfaces like ChatGPT.

Usability Guidelines

Microsoft Co-Founder predicted in 1982 *“personal agents that help us
get a variety of tasks”* (Bill Gates, 1982) and it was Microsoft that
introduced the first widely available personal assistant in 1996, called
Clippy, inside the Microsoft Word software. Clippy was among the first
assistants to reach mainstream adoption, helping users not yet
accustomed to working on a computer, to get their bearings (Tash
Keuneman, 2022). Nonetheless, it was in many ways useless and intrusive,
suggesting there was still little knowledge about UX and human-centered
design. Gates never wavered though and is quoted in 2004 saying *“If you
invent a breakthrough in artificial intelligence, so machines can learn,
that is worth 10 Microsofts”* Lohr (2004). Gates updated his ideas in
2023 focuses on the idea of *AI Agents* (Gates, 2023).

As late as in 2017, scientists were trying to create a program with
enough *natural-language understanding* to extract basic facts from
scientific papers Stockton (2017)

Might we try again?

With the advent of ChatGPT, the story of Clippy has new relevance as
part of the history of AI Assistants. Benjamin Cassidy (2022) and
Abigail Cain (2017) illustrate beautifully the story of Clippy and Tash
Keuneman (2022) ask poignantly: “We love to hate Clippy — but what if
Clippy was right?”

### Performing Under High-Stakes Situations

AI-based systems are being implemented in medicine, where stakes are
high raising the need for ethical considerations. Since CADUCEUS in the
1970s (in Kanza et al., 2021), the first automated medical decision
making system, medical AI now provides Health Diagnosic Symptoms and
AI-assistants in medical imaging. (Calisto et al., 2022) focuses on
AI-human interactions in medical workflows and underscores the
importance of output explainability. Medical professionals who were
given AI results with an explanation trusted the results more. (P. Lee
et al., 2023) imagines an AI revolution in medicine using GPT models,
providing improved tools for decreasing the time and money spent on
administrative paperwork while providing a support system for analyzing
medical data.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[55] }} />

### Human-Computer Interactions Without a “Computer”

How does AI affect Human-Computer Interactions

The field of Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) emphasizes designing
user experiences (UX) that cater to human needs (The International
Ergonomics Association, 2019). Designers think through every interaction
of the user with a system and consider a set of metrics at each point of
interaction including the user’s context of use and emotional needs.

Software designers, unlike industrial designers, can’t physically alter
the ergonomics of a device, which should be optimized for human
well-being to begin with and form a cohesive experience together with
the software. However, software designers can significantly reduce
mental strain by crafting easy-to-use software and user-friendly user
journeys. Software interaction design goes beyond the form-factor and
accounts for human needs by using responsive design on the screen, aural
feedback cues in sound design, and even more crucially, by showing the
relevant content at the right time, making a profound difference to the
experience, keeping the user engaged and returning for more. In the
words of (Babich, 2019), ***“***\[T\]he moment of interaction is just a
part of the journey that a user goes through when they interact with a
product. User experience design accounts for all user-facing aspects of
a product or system”.

Drawing a parallel from narrative studies terminology, we can view user
interaction as a heroic journey of the user to achieve their goals, by
navigating through the interface until a success state - or facing
failure. Storytelling has its part in interface design however designing
for transparency is just as important, when we’re dealing with the
user’s finances and sustainability data, which need to be communicated
clearly and accurately, to build long-term trust in the service. For a
sustainable investment service, getting to a state of success - or
failure - may take years, and even longer. Given such long timeframes,
how can the app provide support to the user’s emotional and practical
needs throughout the journey?

(Tubik Studio, 2018) argues *affordance* measures the *clarity* of the
interface to take action in user experience design, rooted in human
visual perception, however, affected by knowledge of the world around
us. A famous example is the door handle - by way of acculturation, most
of us would immediately know how to use it - however, would that be the
case for someone who saw a door handle for the first time? A similar
situation is happening to the people born today. Think of all the
technologies they have not seen before - what will be the interface they
feel the most comfortable with?

For the vast majority of this study’s target audience (college
students), social media can be assumed as the primary interface through
which they experience daily life. The widespread availability of mobile
devices, cheap internet access, and AI-based optimizations for user
retention, implemented by social media companies, means this is the
baseline for young adult users’ expectations (as of writing in 2020).

(Don Shin et al., 2020) proposes the model (fig. 10) of Algorithmic
Experience (AX) ***“**investigating the nature and processes through
which users perceive and actualize the potential for algorithmic
affordance”* highlighting how interaction design is increasingly
becoming dependent on AI. The user interface might remain the same in
terms of architecture, but the content is improved, based on
personalization and understanding the user at a deeper level.

In 2020 (when I proposed this thesis topic), Google had recently
launched an improved natural language engine to better understand search
queries (“Understanding Searches Better Than Ever Before,” 2019), which
was considered the next step towards *understanding* human language
semantics. The trend was clear, and different types of algorithms were
already involved in many types of interaction design, however, we were
in the early stages of this technology (and still are *early* in 2024).
Today’s ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini have no problem understanding human
semantics - yet are they intelligent?

Intelligence may be besides the point as long as AI *becomes very good
at reasoning*. AI is a *reasoning engine* (Bubeck et al., 2023; Shipper,
2023; see J. Bailey, 2023 for a summary). That general observation
applies to voice recognition, voice generation, natural language
parsing, among others. Large consumer companies like McDonald’s are in
the process of replacing human staff with AI assistants in the
drive-through, which can do a better job in providing a personal service
than human clerks, for whom it would be impossible to remember the
information of thousands of clients. In (Barrett, 2019), in the words of
*Easterbrook*, a previous CEO of McDonald’s *“How do you transition from
mass marketing to mass personalization?”*

### Do AI-Agents Need Anthropomorphism

What are the next features that could improve the next-generation UX/UI
of AI-based assistants?

-   GPT 4o combines different abilities into the same model, preserving
    more information: (OpenAI, 2024b).

(Stone Skipper, 2022) sketches a vision of *“\[AI\] blend into our lives
in a form of apps and services”* deeply ingrained into daily human
activity.

Should AIs look anthropomorphic or fade in the background? It’s an open
question. Perhaps we can expect a mix of both depending on the context
of use and goals of the particular AI.

(Aschenbrenner, 2024) predicts “drop-in virtual coworkers”, AI-agents
who are able to use computer systems like a human seamlessly replacing
human employees.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[56] }} />

-   (A. Costa & Silva, 2022) “Interaction Design for AI Systems”

### Roleplay for Financial Robo-Advisors

*Robo-advisors* is a fintech term that was in fashion largely before the
arrival of AI assistants and has been thus superseded by newer
technologies. Ideally, robo-advisors can be more dynamic than humans and
respond to changes to quickly and cheaply. Human advisors are very
expensive and not affordable for most consumers. (Capponi et al., 2019)
argues *“The client has a risk profile that varies with time and to
which the robo-advisor’s investment performance criterion dynamically
adapts”*. The key improvement of *personalized financial advice* is
understanding the user’s *dynamic risk profile*.

-   Newer literature notes robo-advisor related research is scattered
    across disciplines (H. Zhu et al., 2024). – Athropomorphism:
    human-like attributes in robo-advisors, such as conversational
    chatbots, can affect adoption and risk preferences among customers.
    Studies show that anthropomorphic robo-advisors increase customer
    trust and reduce algorithm aversion.” **similar to my research**

In the early days of robo-advisory, Germany and the United Kingdom led
the way with the most robo-advisory usage in Europe (Cowan, 2018). While
Germany had 30+ robot-advisors on the market in 2019, with a total of
3.9 billion EUR under robotic management, it was far less than
individual apps like Betterment managed in the US (Bankinghub, 2019).
Already in 2017, several of the early robo-advisors apps have shut down
in the UK (AltFi, 2017). ETFmatic gained the largest number of downloads
by 2017, focusing exclusively on exchange-traded funds (ETFs), tracking
stock-market indexes automatically, with much less sophistication, than
their US counterparts \[ibid\]. The app was bought by a bank in 2021 and
closed down in 2023 (AltFi, 2021; “ETFmatic - Account Funding of EURO
Accounts Ceases,” 2023; Silva, 2023).

````mdx-code-block
<Figure caption="Out-of-date user interface of a European AI-Advisor ETFmatic in 2017 which was closed down in 2023 (Photo copyright ETFmatic)" src={ETF} />
````

Some relevant papers include a comparison of robot advisors by (Barbara
Friedberg, 2021) and (Slack, 2021)’s account of how before Generative
AI, financial chatbots were developed manually using a painstaking
process that was slow and error-prone, for example using the Atura
Process. Older financial robo-advisors, built by fintech companies
aiming to provide personalized suggestions for making investments such
as Betterment and Wealthfront are forced to upgrade their technology to
keep up.

The user interface and user experience (UI/UX) of consumer-focused
investing apps in Europe has improved a over the past decade. The
changing landscape is related to the earlier availability of better
quality apps available in the US and the disappearance of the 1st
generation of rudimentary investing apps and the lessons learned on how
to automate the delivery of financial services while increasing user
satisfaction.

In India, research is being conducted on how AI advisors could assist
with investors’ erratic behavior in stock market volatility situations,
albeit without much success (Bhatia et al., 2020). India had more than
2000 fintechs since 2015 (Migozzi et al., 2023).

    traditionally closer to the consumer - such as retailers. Financial
    AI companion apps have not yet grown to mainstream scale in Asia,
    Africa, Latin America, and Europe, being for the moment a largely
    US-based retail investor trend. The apps outside of the US are niche
    products in a nascent stage, however, they still provide relevant
    design directions or stories of what to avoid.

## Sustainable Finance Democratization of Finance

This chapter explores the larger trend of *Democratization of Financial
Markets* which includes consumer apps that enable new user interactions
which increasingly blur boundaries between shopping, saving, and
investing (termed here *SSI*). The efforts to boost user numbers have
driven apps that started out with only payments-focused businesses -
such as Revolut and N26 - branch out into offering savings accounts and
investing options.

Sustainable capital allocation methods are many. Regardless of if it’s
money spent on shopping or money saved and invested, these are all
financial decisions of *capital allocation*, and in one way or another,
we’re giving our money to companies pushing economic growth.

The critical question is: do people choose to support
sustainability-focused companies - companies which invest deeply into
green innovation and eco-friendly practices - or those that pay less
attention to sustainability?

The journey from consumer to investor is increasingly possible because
of the *democratization of financial markets*.

Empowering consumers to access finance through digital technologies and
delivering a simple UX (user experience) – i.e. the fintech trend of the
last 2 decades -, includes financial products creating pathways towards
sustainability-focused investing. The extent to which this funnel
works - and it’s indeed a complex, multi–step funnel - depends on
curbing greenwashing to a level that allows consumers to distinguish
eco–friendly businesses from the heavy polluters.

ESG (Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance)

Consumers are beginning to become more money-savvy yet are still missing
many key concepts from financial literacy. Giving users exposure to
investment opportunities through familiar activities like shopping may
have the potential to boost financial literacy levels and entice
consumers to learn more about taking advantage of their opportunities
financial markets - as well as how to manage the types or risk involved.

Shopping, saving, and investing are converging on digital platforms
(superapps) that permeate our daily financial lives, with features such
basic banking, payments, transfers, as well as reward and cashback
programs (Rakuten), round-up to next dollar with automated
micro-investing (e.g. Acorn, Stash, Swedbank), and retail investing
(Robinhood, Public) and copy-trading (eToro) into various (fractional
shares of) stocks, derivatives like CFDs and futures, microloans (Kiva),
commodities and precious metals such as gold and silver (Revolut),
physical assets such as real estate, land, forest and digital assets
such as cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and other alternative assets.

Money is becoming more diverse and the meaning of money itself is
changing. We have the fiat money created by governments by law, using
central banks, which loan money to commercial banks. And we also have
new types of money created by companies and individuals using
cryptographic blockchain-based distributed databases, which keep track
of transactions (who-paid-whom). Whatever the method of creation, in
essence, money is a *system of trust* where *something* is used as a
*medium of value exchange* and accepted by *other people* as payment.
Digital money in it’s various forms connects industries on the same
apps, which make investing more accessible and socially engaging,
appealing to younger people who are active in social media and online
shopping.

Trend of sustainably, how can sustainability become more accessible?
People want to shop, save, and invest sustainably - how to do it?

### Legislation

Legislation is Catching Up With Fintechs. Legislation sets higher
standards.

Directive 14 2014/65/EU, 2014: The European Union fully recognizes the
changing financial landscape trending towards the democratization of
investments: *“more investors have become active in the financial
markets and are offered an even more complex wide-ranging set of
services and instruments”* (European Parliament, 2014). Some key
legislation for investors has been put in place recently, for example
“MiFID II is a legislative framework instituted by the European Union
(EU) to regulate financial markets in the bloc and improve protections
for investors” (Kenton, 2020). MiFID II and MiFIR will ensure fairer,
safer and more efficient markets and facilitate greater transparency for
all participants” (European Securities and Markets Authority, 2017).

Already in 2001, while still part of the EU, the UK government was
discussing ways to promote sustainable investment *“fundamental changes
in VAT or corporation taxes could be used to promote greener consumption
and investment”* (House of Commons, 2002). More recently, (HM Treasury,
2020) released a taxonomy of sustainable activities in the UK.

Campain to ban polluting products campaign success story, EU shops can’t
sell deforestation products gathered over 100 thousand online signatures
(*EU*, 2022). Legislation banning products contributing to deforestation
was passed by the EU Parliament and Council in 2023 and came into effect
in July 2024 (Abnett & Abnett, 2024; European Parliament, 2023)

While the above trend is for governments to adapt to and work towards
their environmental climate commitments and public demand, the sovereign
risk remains an issue. For example, in the U.S. the policies supported
by President Donald Trump during his presidency ran counter to many
sustainability recommendations, including those directed at the
financial markets, helping legacy industries stay competitive for longer
through subsidies, and lack of regulation, or even regulation supporting
legacy technologies (Quinson, 2020).

(PWC, 2020) Changes to laws and regulations aimed at achieving climate
change mitigation is a key driver behind the wave of ESG adoption. The
goal of these laws, first adopted in the European Union, a
self-proclaimed leader in eco-friendliness, is to pressure unsustainable
companies to change towards greener practices, in fear of losing their
access to future capital, and to create a mechanism forcing entire
environmentally non-compliant business sectors to innovate towards
sustainability unless they want to suffer from financial penalties. On
the flip side of this stick and carrot fiscal strategy, ESG-compliant
companies will have incentives to access to cheaper capital and larger
investor demand from ESG-friendly investors.

### Shopping

#### Shopping Footprint

Double Eleven 11/11 celebrated on November 11th is the world’s largest
shopping festival (時代財經, 2023). In June 2023, 526 million people
watch e-commerce live-streams in China; online bargaining is a type of
ritual (Shiyu Liu et al., 2024).

It may seem impossible to turn the tide of consumerism, given the
projected growth in online shopping (Forrester, 2024)

![](_thesis_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-45-output-1.png)

-   Igini (2022) Online Shopping impact. Single’s day, etc.

-   “Asia is set to account for 50% of the world’s total online retail
    sales”

#### AI shopping assistants

important - more and more consumers using AI assistants to find
alternative products, make shopping lists, etc
(**pandyaAdobeAnalyticsTraffic2025?**);
(**pastoreMoreConsumersUsing2025?**); (**neuronGetReadyYour2025?**)

#### Consumer Activism

*Conscious consumers* make up a small percentage of the entire consumer
public. (Milne et al., 2020) coins the term *mindful consumers*, who do
research and are aware of the impact of their shopping choices.

-   Consume pressure to advance ESG regulatory standards to add a
    baseline ESG dynamic pricing of risk like climate, mandatory climate
    disclosures, carbon pricing knowing your supply chain, analyze
    supply chain risk

-   Is Sustainable Shopping possible? “Learn to notice so we can
    preserve”, “Õpetame märkama, et oskaksime hoida”. “Consumers have
    increasing power. Where we put our money reinforces certain types of
    businesses, as conscious consumers we can vote with our dollars. How
    can we do it？ Sustainable brands, ESG, etc, etc. Pushing highers
    Standards and choose companies that adopt circular design” What is
    the consumer CO<sub>2</sub> contribution? What is the target?

-   Fuentes et al. (2019) discusses package free shopping.
-   van der Wal et al. (2016) discusses “status motives make people
    publicly display sustainable behavior”.

For consumer activism to become mainstream it needs to much simpler.

#### Payments

Banks and Fintechs Capture User Data. Payments are an Entry Point and
Source of Consumer Action Data, Shopping Data. Payments is the primary
way consumers use money. Is there a funnel From Payments to Investing?
ESG Shopping is about Changing our relationship with money. Make
commerce more transparent. Current shopping is like having a one-night
stand. you barely know the name of your company. You don’t know much
about their background. Building consumer feeling of ownership, create
meaningful connections between producers and consumers.

Payments is one way consumers can take individual climate action. In the
words of a Canadian investment blogger, *“every dollar you spend or
invest is a vote for the companies and their ethical and sustainability
practices”* (Fotheringham, 2017). The combination of consumption and
investment is an access point to get the consumer thinking about
investing. Even if the amount are small, they are a starting point for a
thought process.

Digitalisation of payments creates lots of Point of Sale (PoS) data
that’s valuable to understand what people buy. Banks have access to each
person’s financial habits which makes it possible to model sustainable
behavior using big data analysis. Asian markets have shown the fastest
growth in the use of digital payments (McKinsey, 2020).

In Taiwan, O Bank makes use of Mastercard’s data to calculate each
transaction’s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and offer Taiwanese clients
“Consumer Spending Carbon Calculator” and “Low-Carbon Lifestyle Debit
Card” products (*Taiwan’s O-Bank Launches ’Consumer Spending Carbon
Calculator,’ Rewards Carbon Reduction*, 2022). Mastercard has developed
a service that banks can offer consumers sustainability reports
(Mastercard, 2021). Similarly, Commons, formerly known as Joro, an
independent app, analyses your personal financial data to estimate your
CO<sub>2</sub> footprint (Chant, 2022).

A Dutch fintech company Bunq offers payment cards for sustainability,
provided by MasterCard, which connects everyday payments to green
projects, such as planting trees and donations to charities within the
same user interface (Bunq, 2020). At the same time this can be
considered greenwashing as Bunq only plants 1 tree per every €1,000
spend with a Bunq card. The example marketed at students cites *8 trees
planted this month* while students scarcely would have €8,000 to spend
every month.

Sharing a similar goal to Alibaba’s Ant Forest, Bunq’s approach creates
a new interaction dynamic in a familiar context (card payments),
enabling customers to effortlessly contribute to sustainability.
However, it lacks the level of gamification which makes Alibaba’s
offering so addictive, while also not differentiating between the types
of purchases the consumer makes, in terms of the level of
eco-friendliness.

````mdx-code-block
<Figure caption="Bunq promises to combine banking and eco-friendly actions in the same user interface" src={Bunq} />
````

In Nigeria, (Emele Onu & Anthony Osae-Brown, 2022) reports how in order
to promote the eNaira digital currency use, the Nigerian government
limited the amount of cash that can be withdrawn from ATMs *“In
Nigeria’s largely informal economy, cash outside banks represents 85% of
currency in circulation and almost 40 million adults are without a bank
account.”* **\[E-Naira find papers\]**

In Kenya, M-Pesa started since 2007 for mobile payments, used by more
than 80% of farmers (Parlasca et al., 2022; Tyce, 2020). Using digital
payments instead of cash enables a new class of experiences, in terms of
personalization, and potentially, for sustainability.

In Sweden, point of sales (PoS) lending is a common practice, and one of
the reasons for the success of Klarna, the Swedish banking startup,
which has managed to lend money to more consumers than ever, through
this improved user experience. Taking out loans for consumption is a
questionable personal financial strategy at best. If people can loan
money at the point of sales, why couldn’t there be 180 degrees opposite
service - point of sales investing? And there is, called “round-up
apps”. Next Generation Customer Experience (n.d.) suggests “Targeted at
millennials, Acorns is the investing app that rounds up purchases to the
nearest dollar and invests the difference.” - and example of From
Shopping to Investing.

Many banks have started offering a service to automatically save and
invest tiny amounts of money collected from shopping expenses. Every
purchase one makes contributes a small percentage - usually rounded up
to the nearest whole number - to one’s investment accounts. For example,
Swedbank (2022), the leading bank in the Estonian market, offers a
savings service where everyday payments made with one’s debit card are
rounded up to the next Euro, and this amount is transferred to a
separate savings account. Similarly, the Estonian bank LHV (2020) offers
micro-investing and micro-savings services, with an interesting user
experience innovation showing how for an average Estonian means
additional savings of about 400€ per year.

-   Bank inside of Whatsapp for the underbanked gig workers in Latin
    America Y Combinator (2023)
-   Kirakosian (Noveber 16, 2020) Digital payments and circular
    bio-economy, even using tactics such as co-branding with famous
    individuals.

While the financial industry is highly digitized, plenty of banks are
still paper-oriented, running digital and offline processes
simultaneously, making them slower and less competitive, than startups.
Indeed, the new baseline for customer-facing finance is set by fintech,
taking cues from the successful mobile apps in a variety of sectors,
foregoing physical offices, and focusing on offering the best possible
online experience for a specific financial service, such as payments.

Banks and Fintech are becoming more similar than ever. 39% of Millenials
are willing to leave their bank for a better fintech (n=4,282);
innovation in payments helps retention (PYMNTS, 2023). The European
Central Bank describes fintech as improving the user experience across
the board, making interactions more convenient, user-friendly, cheaper,
and faster. “Fintech has had a more pronounced impact in the payments
market \[…\] where the incumbents have accumulated the most glaring
shortcomings, often resulting in inefficient and overpriced products,”
Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB says in European
Central Bank (2019).

There are also people who are concerned with digital payments. There are
concerns digital currencies also help to *“democratize financial
surveillance”.* China was a money innovator introducing paper money in
the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD) (“First Paper Money,” n.d.). Jeff Benson
(2022) “use the e-CNY network to increase financial surveillance.”
“Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) Tracker” (2023) Digital currencies
make tracking easier. Yahoo Finance (2022): WeChat, Alipay, vs digital
yuan by Eswar Prasad. “Contactless Payments Prevalent in Macau - City’s
de Facto Central Bank” (2023) in Macau Contactless Payments are
prevalent.

There are many *neobanks*, or challenger banks, far too many to list.
The table only includes a small sample of banks and the landscape is
even larger if one includes the wider array of fintechs. Neo-banks often
use sustainability marketing.

The following popular (totaling millions of users) robo-advisory apps
combine sustainability, personalization, ethics, and investing however,
they are mostly only available on the US market.

Does Individual Climate Action Matter?

#### Buy Now Pay Later

Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) is the biggest consumer payments / financing
success story innovated by Klarna in Sweden in 2005 and Afterpay in
Australia in 2015 but with roots in Layaway Programs created during the
1930’s US Great Depression (Kenton, 2023). By 2021, 44.1% of Gen-Z in
the US had used BNPL according to (EMarketer, 2021). Gen-Z mostly use
BNPL to buy clothes (LHV, 2024).

-   ***Design Implication:*** This suggests users are already used to
    having more options in the payment flow.

#### Social Commerce

(The Influencer Factory, 2021) China is the furthest ahead in social
shopping, the Chinese and U.S. market may be mature and growth will come
from emerging markets (SEA, Latin-America).

![](_thesis_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-47-output-1.png)

### Saving

There are two ways to look at sustainable saving. This section is going
to look at savings in the financial sense of the word. Savings in the
sense of CO2e emission and environmental cost reductions have an entire
separate chapter dedicated to them titled ‘*sustainability*’ however a
short definition might be valuable here as well.

> *Environmental Savings* means *“the credit incurred by a community
> that invests in environmental protection now instead of paying more
> for corrective action in the future*” (see Yale Center for
> Environmental Law & Policy, 2018) and (*Yale, Princeton, Stanford, MIT
> and Vanderbilt Students Take Legal Action to Try to Force Fossil Fuel
> Divestment - The Washington Post*, n.d., p. 33).

#### Saving Money

Saving precedes investing. From building loyalty to building ownership,
the first step towards investing is to start saving money. How to
encourage savings in daily life and make it a part of the everyday
payments experience? Even starting with a small step, gathering a small
target amount per month for savings, has the potential to shift the
user’s way of thinking about money. The second step, choosing where to
invest these savings, will help us begin thinking like an investor. To
start noticing trends and looking into how finance shapes the world.

#### Psychology of Saving

People will only save nature if it also saves money.

-   Nerdwallet’s Tommy Tindall (2023) suggests making financial
    commitments instead of resolutions.

-   Savings and investing are conflated because the large majority of
    savings that people have are invested by their banks. Thus the
    question of *sustainable savings* comes one of where exactly are
    they invested and what is the impact of that investment of
    sustainability.

-   Savings are the money one has in a pension fund or managed by
    themselves. For the majority of people, savings are invested by the
    bank and make up the largest proportion on investments for the
    people who are not active investors themselves.

-   Ethical Savings (*Ethical Savings*, 2023)

-   The fact that money on a Wise account will accrue value while on
    Monese it’s just static, immediately makes Wise more attractive,
    even if the amounts are small.

#### Anthropomorphism

-   Money in a “Safe” place: Money anthropomorphism increases saving
    behavior (L. Wang et al., 2023).

-   Mobile money users are better at saving (Naito et al., 2021).

-   Design Implication: make saving money look like an avatar or piggy
    bank or smth.

#### Loyalty Schemes

help consumers save money and business increase repeat business.
Building customer loyalty is a key part of repeat business and financial
predictability for any company. Large consumer brands like Starbucks
have for long ran successful rewards programs that encourage customers
to come back (Steinhoff & Zondag, 2021). Could loyalty schemes create a
pathway to investing in the company to a strengthen the feeling of
connection with the business even further? After all, I’m now a minority
owner! Yet in practice, many consumers lack the financial literacy for
investing and there are many legislative difficulties for turning
loyalty points into investments. It’s easier instead to create a
separate cryptocurrency or token program which users could collect and
redeem for some benefit.

-   **Patagonia** “Worn Wear” program

-   **H&M** “Garment Collecting” program

-   **The Body Shop** “Return, Recycle, Repeat”

Loyalty schemes can take a physical form. In Malaysia, Beebag shopping
bags made of recycled plastic bottles with a NFC ship that works in
conjunction with an app to provide rebates for customers (The Green
Factor, 2022).

-   Savings in CO<sub>2</sub> Equivalent Emissions: CO<sub>2</sub>
    savings are the amount of CO2e reduction one manages to achieve by
    changing one’s behavior and influencing others (people, companies).
    While the individual footprint is so small, the largest reduction
    will come from influencing large groups of people, either by
    leadership, role-model, or other means. Pension funds are some of
    the largest asset holders and choosing where to invest one’s pension
    can be a sustainable financial action. College students might not
    have a pension fund yet.

#### Saving CO2

### Investing

#### Measuring the Eco-Investment Gap

By the latest estimates sustainability lacks several trillions of USD in
investment. Even with massive financing already in the pipeline, the
estimate for the global *financing gap* for low-carbon energy production
was 5.2 trillion USD as of 2016 (Earth Day, 2023; “Mapping the Gap,”
2016). Ray Dalio puts the needed climate investment at \$5T and believes
these financial goals won’t be met (Ray Dalio, 2023). A newer United
Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) calculation lowered the world
needs an additional 4.1 Trillion USD of financing in nature-based
solutions by 2050 to meet climate change, biodiversity, and land
degradation reduction targets (UNEP, 2022).

According to (The Rockefeller Foundation, 2022) a slightly lower 2.5-3.2
Trillion USD would be sufficient.

![](_thesis_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-48-output-1.png)

What if 10% of annual consumer spending – *ten percent is about
\$2,8T* - went towards protecting our climate? The theme for the 2023
Earth Day was *“Invest In Our Planet”*.

![](_thesis_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-49-output-1.png)

The needed investment doesn’t seem so large, around 5% of the global
GDP, if one compares it to the *per year* Global Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) estimated at around 100 Trillion USD in 2022 and growing to 105
Trillion USD in 2023 (Aaron O’Neill, 2023; IMF, 2023). In essence, the
estimated total investment gap in climate fits into the economic growth
of 1 year of the global economy.

Bad news. It would be easier for large institutional investors to move
their money to sustainable assets than for retail investors to move
their relatively small investments.

The lack of funding in green energy especially affects emerging
economies (“Mobilizing Capital Into Emerging Markets and Developing
Economies,” 2022). *“We can and must channel private capital into
nature-based solutions. This will require policy and regulatory support,
catalytic capital and financial innovation”* argued the CEO Green
Finance Institute, Dr Rhian-Mari Thomas, ahead of COP27 in Egypt (*Green
Finance Institute*, 2023). It’s not happening fast enough.

![](_thesis_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-50-output-1.png)

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[60] }} />

While these assets and GDP values reflect different aspects of the
global economy, the comparison illustrates that redirecting a relatively
small fraction of global wealth and economic activity towards
sustainable investments can close the investment gap. This perspective
should inspire confidence that the goal is achievable with coordinated
effort and policy support.

-   Robeco survey of 300 large global investors totaling \$27T under
    management found biodiversity-protection is increasingly a
    focus-point of capital allocation (Robeco, 2023).

-   Compliance and GenAI in banking: (Rahul Agarwal et al., 2024).

-   “Lessons from banking to improve risk and compliance and speed up
    digital transformations” (Jim Boehm et al., 2021).

-   OECD (2024) projects steady economic growth 3.1% in 2024 and 3.2% in
    2025 while the World Bank & World Bank (2024) is more conservative
    projecting 2.6% and 2.7% respectively.

#### Sustainable Investing

While literature has been debating if it’s possible to *“do well while
doing good”*, latest research suggests it’s possible to make investments
that both make an attractive financial return and adhere to
sustainability goals. Y.-M. Tan et al. (2023)

“sustainable investing is now part of mainstream financial strategy”
Morgan Stanley (2019)

“Sustainable development requires more investment in sustainable
companies and less in unsustainable firms.” (Van Zanten & Rein, 2023).

#### Young Investors

Young investors are typically *retail investors* investing small amounts
of money for themselves. (Unless they have inherited wealth or are among
the very few who work in an institution such as an investment firm,
university endowment, pension fund or mutual fund, and have a say in
where to invest large amounts of other peoples’ money.)

Retail investors face many challenges in comparison with their
institutional counterparts. For instance, they may have much less time
to do proper research, face information asymmetries, where finding good
information is limited by time, ability, as well as financial literacy,
whereas professional investors have the tools, skills, time, and
knowledge, to make better investment decisions.

-   *For young people, investing mostly means buying cryptocurrencies?*

-   Copy-investing is a popular feature of retail investing platforms
    like EToro

-   Investing is a fundamentally hopeful act. It means I think there’s a
    future. Specifically, ‘green investing’ is investing in the future
    of our planet - but can we trust the sustainability practices the
    ‘green’ investment vehicles aggregate, promising to have a positive
    impact? For example, the European Union for many years counted
    biomass as ‘green’ energy, even while forestry companies were
    cutting down trees to produce the biomass - the regulation was not
    specific enough to curb this practice. So, in effect, a ‘green
    investor’ might be supporting deforestation. How can an easy-to-use
    investment app address such complexities without alienating the
    users?

#### Financial Influencers

Retail investing also heavily influenced by social media influencers.

Retail investing apps blend entertainment into the UX/UI of investing.
For example Robinhood uses game-like features such as displaying a
confetti animation to create a sense of excitement around trading
investing. Retail investing UI/UX is simplified and gamified, which
encourage impulsive short-term buying and selling with a focus on
speculation over fundamentals and cause FOMO (fear of missing out).

*Meme stocks* are another aspect of the *entertainmenization* of
investing. There are many groups of Twitter, Reddit, and elsewhere,
where investing trends start, causing more volatility.

Community Investing Enables Financial Inclusion

-   Inexperienced investor can copy other people when investing. You
    don’t know how to invest? Build an investing community? Can follow
    others and raise capital together. In some ways community-investing
    competes with robo-advisors as communities can be led by
    professional investors and followed by less sophisticated investors.
    Investor communities can have the type of *social proof*, which
    robo-advisor do not possess.
-   Investors’ belief in sustainable investing is affected by other
    investors (Luz et al., 2024).

    (lizlivingblue, n.d.).

    Influencer - crypto twitter connections

#### Financial Literacy

-   Financial Literacy. Sustainability Literacy. Financial and
    Sustainability Literacy are intertwined. How can finance
    enable/help/encourage sustainability?
-   Austin Ryder (2020) Define your habits: are you consumer or
    investor?

Retail investors typically have less financial literacy.

#### Retail Investing Enables Financial Inclusion

*Retail investing* can be seen as a form of financial inclusion. Ant
Group’s CEO Eric Jing says in (Turrin, 2021): *“The financial system of
the past 200 years was designed for the industrial era and served only
20% of the population and organizations. As we enter the digital age, we
must better serve the remaining 80%”.*

Among retail investors, there’s some appetite for sustainability however
investors are not sure how to separate sustainable assets from less
sustainable ones (Ho, 2019).

-   Consumption is ruining the world the world thinking as an investor
    the investor mindset

Doorn (2020): Many ecologically focused funds with different approaches
have been launched in recent years, with variations in asset mix and
style of management. Thematic asset management is expected to grow, with
investors packaging opportunities based on consumer trends.

T. Smith (2019) suggests 74% of Chinese youth are looking for “positive
impact”.

-   Lingeswaran (2019) suggest philanthropy is on the rise in Asia
    however

-   M. Li et al. (2022) suggests retail “investor attention can
    significantly improve enterprises’ green innovation level”

-   But there’s so much capital in large funds retails investor money
    doesn’t matter at all. does retail money make any difference? Retail
    Investor Helpers: A wide number of banks are offering services
    marketed a sustainable. It’s hard to decide.

-   For example - In Sweden “Preferences for sustainable and responsible
    equity funds

-   Lagerkvist et al. (2020) undertook a choice experiment with Swedish
    private investors.

-   “Meet the Fintechs Leading Sweden’s Green Revolution” (2021)
    ***Swedish green fintech (important article)***

-   Gov launching ESG funds.

-   Why is this important to research now? People in their twenties
    should invest in their future. Millennials and younger generations
    like services with a green, eco-conscious focus. Given our combined
    power (I’m a Millennial) with Generation Z, we are willing to pay
    more for sustainable products.

-   Personalized Investing

-   2022 saw a wave of new platforms aiming to make investing easier for
    retail investors

-   One example is Revolut, which expanded from a simple payments app to
    support varied saving and investment types (“Kickstart Your
    Investment Journey,” 2023; “Revolut Launches ETF Trading Platform in
    Europe,” 2023).

-   Gamestop for climate massively collaborative investing by gen-z?

#### Financial Ecologies

-   G. K. S. Tan (2020) proposes *“financial ecologies”* to understand
    the dynamic relationships between various actors: investors,
    advisors, government, where the government plays an active role in
    growing financial inclusion and responsible financial management.
    However, the paper further suggests that current robo-advisors
    (available in Singapore) make the investor captive to the agency of
    AI, making the person lose agency over their financial decisions.

-   ESG apps in Singapore:

-   DBS LiveBetter consumer sustainability app (DBS, 2018; DBS
    Singapore, n.d.)

-   Singapore ESG open data platform (Monetary Authority of Singapore,
    2023)

#### Bonds

Bonds are a form of debt investment also known as an fixed-income asset
where the principal is repaid at the maturation date of the bond
(usually in years) with an added premium. Individuals can’t emit bonds
but they can invest in them. It can be a way to invest locally in one’s
own city - or globally. For individuals, there’s access to some green
bond exposure through ETFs (exchange-traded funds) available on retail
investing apps.

Access is not universal and availability depends on the geography of the
user and local legislation; for example Revolut, the most downloaded
finance app in the EU, only enabled bond investing for European
customers in summer 2024 (Revolut, 2024b, 2024a). Investing in bonds is
a form of *Passive Investing* and allows investors focus on low-risk
passive income instead of daily stock investing most popular on
Robinhood and Revolut - albeit with much less potential for returns.

-   Climate Bonds Initiative is working on greening the \$55 trillion
    short-term debt (bond) market (“Climate Bonds Initiative Calls for
    Greening of \$55trn Short-Term Debt Market,” 2022).

#### Green Bonds

*Green bonds* are released by companies, international organizations,
and cities to raise money for green transformation, usually for building
something to improve sustainability, tied to specific projects. There’s
a growing global trend in green bond emission, with 257 Billion USD
worth of green bonds issued in 2019, expected to reach 1 Trillion USD
annually by 2030 (MacAskill et al., 2021). That prediction was too low
with 870 Billion USD green bond emissions reached already in 2023;
currently Europe is the largest emitter of green bonds (Climate Bonds,
2023). China has the 2nd largest green bond market in the world and it’s
growing fast; buyers are looking for green bond certification to reduce
yield spread, meaning the price of the green bond is becoming more
similar to the price of a ‘regular’ bond (Q. Li et al., 2022; W. Peng &
Xiong, 2022).

In 2017 the Malmö city in Sweden released green bonds to finance a
sustainable transition of the city (City of Malmö, 2017). An independent
analysis found bonds may not be emitted for financial reasons but to
improve the reputation and city image, lower interest rate (aptly named
*greenium*) with a similar in returns to traditional bonds - and have
their share of challenges, namely being difficult to certify, monitor,
report and measure impact of (Sjöström et al., 2020).

Making sure a green bond is truly supporting sustainability is a
challenge. For example, Aramco, the Saudi Arabian public petroleum and
natural gas company faced scrutiny for what critics deemed as ‘Fake
green bonds’ (Anthropocene Fixed Income Institute (AFII), 2022). Green
bonds can also be emitted on blockchains with the stated goal of
improving transparency. Hong Kong multi-currency green bond on the
blockchain. The issuer (Hong Kong government) hopes to reduce
greenwashing (Hall, 2024; Kitano, 2024). In the EU as well, there are
emerging tools for monitoring green bonds on blockchain (Christodoulou
et al., 2023). (Qin et al., 2023) finds evidence that the combination of
green bonds and blockchains are an enabler carbon neutrality in China.
The World Bank successfully raised 110 Million USD in Australia in
2018-19 and has since doubled the amount in a new 220 Million USD
emission in Switzerland using bonds on a blockchain ledger for
SDG-related projects (World Bank, 2018, 2019, 2024).

#### Sustainability-Linked Bonds

Sustainability-Linked Bonds are less stringent than green bonds; they
are not tied to specific projects but more broad sustainability targets
(Priscila Azevedo Rocha et al., 2022): “Sustainability-linked bonds let
companies borrow cheaply if they meet environmental, social, and
governance targets. A Bloomberg News analysis found those goals are
weak”. (Priscila Azevedo Rocha et al., 2022) suggests *“So far, most ESG
investing is in the stock market. But the the \$22 trillion corporate
bond market, where mature global companies such as Chanel go to borrow
money from investors, has a particularly powerful role to play.
Companies rely on debt much more than they do on stocks.”*

#### Investment Platforms

“Green Bonds, Sustainable Equities, ESG-focused Mutual Funds and ETFs,
Impact Investing (through platforms), Renewable Energy Infrastructure
(via ETFs or mutual funds), Sustainable Real Estate (through REITs or
ETFs), Social Bonds, Carbon Credits (via ETFs or specialized funds),
Sustainable Commodities (via ETFs or funds), Community Investing
(through CDFIs or crowdfunding platforms), Sustainable Infrastructure
Funds (available as ETFs or mutual funds), Environmental, Social, and
Governance (ESG) Metrics Integration (through broad ESG-focused ETFs or
funds)”

Such as “green shops” there are green investing platforms, green ETFs,
etc. All of these are essentially forms of branding designed to make it
easier for investors to find an investing product they trust.

There are many ‘green investment platforms’ who to trust?

#### Hedge Funds

Hedge funds generally are not accessible to retail investors, requiring
a substantial minimum investment. However some Hedge Fund ETFs and
Mutual Funds with Hedge Fund Strategies may try to mimic hedge fund
strategies investing in the same assets.

It’s how the wealthier people invest.

-   While hedge funds used to be available for professional investors,
    *smart contracts* make it possible to create decentralized
    organizations which pool member resources for investing.

(BlackRock, 2022) notes some ESG-oriented hedge funds can be “highly
engaged with management teams” in order to influence management towards
ESG practices in said companies.

#### Investable Asset Classes: Growing Choice for Retail Investors

new asset classes

![](_thesis_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-53-output-1.png)

There are many asset classes only some of which would be accessible to a
retail investors.

-   The main categories of investment products are, based on the
    *Investment Products Investor.gov* (n.d.)

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[62] }} />

*Thematic Capital,* Build a thematic portfolio. There’s a wide range of
investment products marketed as *sustainable*, however many of them are
fake (**CITATION**).

-   Tokenization is similar financial securitization which has been
    happening for a long time. - Art can be securitized and tokenized
    Masterworks (2023) - Blockchain makes this kind of financial
    engineering easier as any developer can do it; one does not need to
    be a bank.

#### Assets: Nature-Backed Assets

-   single.earth etc

#### Assets: Commodities

-   Retail investors can now buy cold and silver.

#### Assets: Real Estate

According to (Debnath et al., 2022) 39% of global CO<sub>2</sub>
emissions comes from the building sector. Construction is large emitter
because of the use of concrete; super tall buildings are very
CO<sub>2</sub> intensive (Zhao & Qin, 2015). Building emissions can be
reduced by using sustainable design and materials, *digital twins* of
architecture enable pre-visualization of different designs (Panaro et
al., 2024) as well modeling the usage of the building, for example the
interior shop floors in commercial real-estate (Jia et al., 2023). In
housing development, there’s evidence of ‘green’ buildings achieving a
‘higher financial return than conventional buildings, both in terms of
rent and sale price’ (Oyedokun, 2017).

Investing into real-estate is increasingly available on co-investing
platforms allowing retail investors access into this asset class with a
relatively low starting price. Thus investing in sustainable
architecture can be an attractive proposal both from an environmental as
from a financial standpoint, also providing a passive income stream in
the form of rent.

#### Assets: Stocks

-   Most popular

#### Assets: Lending

Retail investors can lend small amounts of money (also known as
MicroLending) on peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms such as Twino.
These loans and pooled and the risk is borne in aggregate as a form of
risk-management.

#### Assets: Crypto

There’s a large trend of fusion of decentralized finance (DeFi) and
traditional finance (TradFi), with the largest established investors,
such as BlackRock, launching tokenized funds (Matos, 2024; Sandor, 2024;
Securitize, 2024).

Crypto investing removes most entry barriers while having high risk.
Cryptocurrencies are the most popular financial action among young
people (ADD CITATION) yet in some ways crypto needs even more financial
literacy than traditional financial assets. “Cryptocurrencies -
Worldwide Statista Market Forecast” (n.d.) estimates over 600 million
cryptocurrency users worldwide.

Brazilian (N=573 ) “Crypto investors in Brazil are generally younger,
male, and exhibit higher risk tolerance compared to non-crypto
investors.” Colombo & Yarovaya (2024) “Brazil’s planned adoption of CBDC
(Central Bank Digital Currency).” “It finds that risk tolerance,
economic pessimism, and a belief in better investment acumen are
significant predictors of crypto investment.”

**Centralized Crypto Exchanges vs Self-Wallets** - Centralized Crypto
Exchanges are in essence loaning assets from the user. “The piece of the
settlement aimed at getting important information to customers is more
understandable from a retail protection standpoint. Customers who lend
crypto assets to a company in exchange for a promised return should get
the information they need to assess the risks against the rewards”
(Hester M. Peirce, 2022).

**Financial Engineering** - Crypto enables financial innovation and
financial engineering by anyone with some programming skills.

**Pricing Crypto**

-   Taiwan bans buying cryptocurrencies with credit card because the
    volatility makes it similar to gambling (David Attlee, 2022;
    廣編企劃, 2022).

-   However volatility is relative. Volatile national currencies lead
    people to find other assets to hold. If your national currency is
    collapsing, you might find crypto has a relative safe haven to keep
    your funds.

-   People like Turkey losing 75% of the value of their assets when
    currency collapses, why people buy crypto.

-   Bitcoin is by far the most popular crypocurrency with it’s high
    price volatility creating opportunities for high gains and high
    losses. While bitcoin has been called a “digital gold” for store of
    value, its volatility characteristics are very different from gold,
    as seen on this chart.

The volatility of the markets has notably shifted crypto research
towards pricing theories.

For example, in X research an index of major sustainability news was
compared with crypto prices, which may have negative, positive, or no
correlation with the following cryptocurrencies.

**DAOs**

DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) can be use in a similar way
to Hedge funds, a DAO can have a shared multi-sign wallet than is
invested together.

A lot of financial tooling and more than trad-fi has been replicated in
crypto.

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) which have an investable
treasury may be compare to Hedge Funds as a collective form of
investing. Because of the on-chain nature where transactions are visible
to anyone, they may be seen as more transparent. Typically DAOs have a
voting system to make decision while Hedge Funds may be more centrally
controlled. Also, the legislation affecting each would be different as
hedge funds are an older and more established financial tool whereas
DAOs still fall in somewhat of a gray area.

**Oracles for Sustainability Data**

Intersection with finance and Real World Data.

A data oracle is the concept of a source of real-world data which can be
ingested through an application programming interface (API) to a
blockchain system. There are many databases of sustainability
information which could serve as an oracle for carbon labeling,
packaging, transportation, consumption, and waste.

-   Ethereum (2023)

-   Caldarelli et al. (2020) notes it’s a challenge to ensure the
    accuracy and trustworthiness of real-world data from Oracles.

“We believe that markets for ecosystem assets need to scale urgently,
starting with carbon markets. The challenge is to make these instruments
as recognizable as tradable assets, as measurable as financial
securities, and as investable as other asset classes. Capital must flow
into the environment at scale to deliver climate action.” “Efficient

mechanisms, and this relies on access to credible information.” BeZero

utilises a risk-based approach and seeks to give everyone a common
language of risk. One that is translatable to that used by the \$200
trillion of assets in global financial markets.” BeZero (2022a)

#### Divesting

Divesting is the inverse of investing. Divesting may have a meaningful
impact on companies if large numbers of retail investors collaborate on
‘banning’ the company to send a message to the board. Small individual
divestment has no impact on the governance decisions.

In institutional finance, the Norwegian \$1.3T USD sovereign wealth fund
(the world’s largest) started a divestment trend in 2016 by divesting
first from coal following by divesting from oil, gas and coal extracting
companies (Ben Martin, 2017; Holger, 2019). Their plan to reach net zero
CO2e nonetheless only targets 2050. Furthermore, who would be the
counterpart for such large transactions. The fund also announced
divesting from Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, however has yet to
sell any shares citing lack of buyers on the Moscow stock market.

University of California also followed suit with divestment of its
\$126B USD portfolio from oil and gas.

While divesting makes news headlines, even divestment by large
institutional investors, such as the Norwegian National Pension Fund
(GPFG), has a negligible effect on the heavy polluters’ business; by the
same logic, it can be deducted, the financial effect of retail investors
divesting, is meaningless. If retail investors act in aggregate, the
reputational effect needs further research. *“To halt climate change,
some investors have decided to divest from fossil fuel companies.
Reviewing the literature suggests that divestment from fossil fuel has
limited financial consequences; it slightly increases divested firms’
risk and their cost of capital, while reducing divested firms’ market
value,”* is the pessimistic conclusion by(Plantinga & Scholtens, 2024)

## Econometrics: Decoupling Economic Growth from Environmental Degradation

#### How to Measure the Economy

*Econometrics* is the science of measuring the economy.

> The creator of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) metric in 1934 Simon
> Kuznets said: “The welfare of a nation can scarcely be inferred from a
> measurement of national income as defined by GDP…Goals for ‘more’
> growth should specify of what and for what” (United States. Bureau of
> Foreign and Domestic Commerce et al., 1934).

GDP was the culmination of previous work by many authors, beginning with
William Petty in the 17th century (Rockoff, 2020). This long journey
underlines how a metric about a complex system such as the economy is
continuous work in progress. There has been ongoing work to create
improved metrics such as the the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),
Human Development Index (HDI), Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), Green
GDP, Inclusive Wealth Index, and others (Anielski, 2001; Bleys & Whitby,
2015; Kovacic & Giampietro, 2015).

Measuring wellbeing in addition to GDP and the metric should including
resiliency dashboards, to to visualize metrics beyond GDP and they are
an integral part of country reports (GreensEFA, 2023). Similarly, the
doughnut (donut) economics (more below) model calls for a *“dashboard of
indicators”* (TED, 2018).

-   The true cost of products is hidden. The work is hidden.

#### Evolution of Economics: New Metrics

The first two decades of the 21st century have seen increasing economic
thinking, looking to challenge, improve and upgrade capitalism to match
our current environmental, social, and technological situation, often
called *New Economics.* Some of these include behavioral economics,
sustainable capitalism, regenerative capitalism, doughnut economics,
ecological economics, blue economy, degrowth, attention economy, gift
economy, intent economy, among others. There’s no lack of published
books on changing capitalism, which goes to show there’s readership for
these ideas. Build a new economic theory is out of scope for my thesis
design, however I’ll focus on the parts of economic theory I believe are
relevant for *interaction design*-ing for sustainability.

![](_thesis_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-56-output-1.png)

There are those looking for *new metrics*. One of the first innovators,
already in 1972, was Buthan, with the *Gross National Happiness Index
(GNH)*, which in turn inspired the UN, decades later, in 2012, to create
the International Wellbeing and Happiness Conference and the
International Happiness Day(Kamei et al., 2021; Ribeiro & Lemos Marinho,
2017). The World Bank talks about the comprehensive GDD+ metrics in its
Changing the Wealth of Nations report (World Bank, 2021).

The Wellbeing Economy Alliance (WEAll) countries (New Zealand, Iceland,
Finland, Scotland, Wales) as well as the EU and Canada, started the
coalition in 2018 looking to involve more broad-based metrics in
developing their societies(CEPR, 2022; David Suzuki Foundation, 2021;
Ellsmoor, 2019; Scottish Government, 2022; Wellbeing Economy Alliance,
2022).

Giacalone et al. (2022) looks at wellbeing of Italian communities and
proposes a new composite index.

There’s work ongoing on macroeconomic modeling, aiming to create a
*digital twin* of the economy. Some of the most complex computer models
of the economy include the Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal Model
(GIMF) (Laxton et al., 2010) and DSGE (Dynamic stochastic general
equilibrium).

#### Pricing Externalities

In the simplest sense, prices do not capture all costs. “Consumption,
production, and investment decisions of individuals, households, and
firms often affect people not directly involved in the transactions”
(Helbling, 2012). Externalities as an economic concept was implied by
Alfred Marshall, one of the founders of neoclassical economics, in his
1890 treatise “Principles of Economics,” and further developed by Arthur
Cecil Pigou in his 1920 book “The Economics of Welfare” (Marshall, 1997;
Pigou, 2002). As of 2023, the value of unpriced externalities which are
not included in the GDP is 7.3 trillion USD per year (Trucost & TEEB for
Business Coalition, 2023). The award-winning economist Mariana Mazzucato
argues in (A. H. Gupta, 2020) we should include more into how we value
unpaid labor, relating to the social (S in ESG) (Mazzucato, 2018) as
part of our metrics.

#### Classical Economics vs Ecological Economics

While Adam Smith is most famous for his concept of the *invisible hand*
first appearing in *The Theory of Moral Sentiments* (1759) and further
developed in his seminal work *The Wealth of Nations*, published in
1776, his writings also highlight the interdependence of economic
actors, who through specialization increase productivity, but also
increasingly dependent on each another as well as the role of empathy in
individual actions (Atal et al., 2024).

Ecological economics doesn’t necessarily argue with the foundation of
classical economics, rather ecological economics finds the classical
economics model and by extension neoclassical economics are
*incomplete,* ignoring the physical limits of natural resources.
Ecological economics draws attention to the interdependence of economy
and the ecosystem; there are physical limits to economic growth on a
planet with finite resources.

The biggest point of contention is the necessity of *economic growth*.
The founder of ecological economics Herman Daly was talking about
*prosperity without growth* more than two decades ago, focusing on the
diminishing natural resources (Daly, 1997). Daly was teaching economics
to undergraduates at Louisina State University when he grew dissatisfied
with the standard model of the market, which didn’t include any inputs
(resources) or outputs (pollution), and later modeled his work by
placing the economy *within* the larger system of the ecosphere
(Ketcham, 2023). More recently.(Jackson, 2009, 2017) have expanded on
these ideas with recipes for a *post-growth* world, making the ideas
seem more tangible and precise, yet mostly untested in the real world.

Writing in 1973, E. F. Schumacher argued economics overlooks both
natural resource depletion and environmental degradation and draws on
religion (particularly Buddhism) to suggest a simpler way of life:

> *“Simplicity and non-violence are obviously closely related. The
> optimal pattern of consumption, producing a high degree of human
> satisfaction by means of a relatively low rate of consumption, allows
> people to live without great pressure and strain and to fulfil the
> primary injunction of Buddhist teaching: ‘Cease to do evil; try to do
> good.’”* (Schumacher, 1985)

New economic thinkers are asking how can economic growth and
sustainability be compatible. Some even ask if *economic growth* itself
is the wrong goal? (Diduch, 2020). Degrowth is the most famous contender
in that branch of economics. Is Decoupling Economic Growth and CO2e
Emissions Possible? Is Green Growth an oxymoron? No-one knows as it
hasn’t been done before. Degrowth proponents are pessimistic it’s
possible to decouple greenhouse gas emissions from economic growth;
historical data shows does not show any decoupling. Some data from China
shows decoupling?

#### Doughnut Economics and Regenerative Capitalism

*Doughnut Economics*, introduced in the eponymous book uses a simple
visualization of a doughnut (donut) to help us grasp the big picture of
the economy *embedded* inside the physical and social worlds (Raworth,
2017). It allows one to see the social shortfall and ecological
overshoot of nations at the same time (A. L. Fanning et al., 2021). The
doughnut concept is simple and deep at the same time, a useful as social
object to enable starting conversations with people from all walks of
life, independent of their politics leanings. As Raworth calls it, it’s
a *“self-portrait of humanity in the beginning of the 21st
century”**.*** Combining the *SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals)*
inside the doughnut and the *Planetary Boundaries* (Earth’s ecological
ceiling) outside the doughnut, leaves a space inside the donut
represents a state of equilibrium and balance on spaceship Earth.

In some ways this Doughnut Economics can be described as a movement.
Doughnut Action Labs enable local communities to build local donuts
customized to local problems. While the ideas have not yet been
implemented on a country-level, smaller scale doughnut economics’
success stories have inspired cities to take a comprehensive view of the
doughnut of their own city with several EU cities adopting the vision
(Jordan G. Teicher, 2021). While critics say doughnut economics would
expand the role of the government (Horwitz, 2017), doughnut
practitioners in Brussels believe everything can be adapted to the place
and context (BrusselsDonut, 2022; Oikos Denktank, 2021).

The city of Amsterdam is developing shorter food chains (which save
CO<sub>2e</sub>) and linking residents with food production and
reconnecting people to the food which foster collaboration in the
community (Circle Economy, 2021). Amsterdam has also built comprehensive
dashboards called the Circular Economy Monitor which makes it easy for
anyone to see the progress being made towards the Dutch goal to be a
circular economy by 2050 (Gemeente Amsterdam, 2022; Waterstaat, 2019).

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[63] }} />

*In his 2015 paper Regenerative Capitalism*, John Fullerton, an investor
and a capital markets and derivatives expert, builds his economic theory
on the ideas of Club of Rome and the Limits to Growth (Meadows & Club of
Rome, 1972) as well as taking inspiration from R. Buckminster Fuller.

> *“Nature is a totally efficient, self-regenerating system. If we
> discover the laws that govern this system and live synergistically
> within them, sustainability will follow and humankind will be a
> success.”* (Fuller, 1983)

“\[H\]uman civilization is embedded in the biosphere,” Fullerton’s ideas
aim to balance efficiency with resiliency so the whole system doesn’t
become brittle and break (Confino, 2015; John Fullerton, 2011, 2022).
While regenerative capitalism recognizes the need for economic growth it
also deems “\[t\]he quality of growth matters” (“Regenerative
Capitalism,” 2023). For example, he cites the example of Triodos Bank
which already in the 1980s focused on sustainable banking championing
responsibility, transparency, and business ethics. A member of the
Global Alliance for Banking on Values, Triodos finances projects in
nature preservation and restoration (GABV, 2023).

### Decarbonization Scenarios

The possibility of decoupling economic growth from CO<sub>2e</sub>
emissions (also known as decarbonizing the economy or eco-economic
decoupling) or is hotly debated (pun intended) among scientists. (Keyßer
& Lenzen, 2021) provides several scenarios for low, medium, and high
levels of decoupling titled Degrowth, IPCC, and Dec-Extreme.

![](_thesis_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-57-output-1.png)

Looking a the United Kingdom, (harrisson, 2019) concludes UK’s
CO<sub>2e</sub> emissions have fallen 43% from 1990 to 2017 through the
use of less carbon-intensive energy sources and argues for moderate
policies in (Hausfather & Peters, 2020).

![](_thesis_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-58-output-1.png)

Meanwhile the cumulative CO<sub>2e</sub> emissions trend in the UK in
the same timeframe show the historic responsibility of UK (Global Carbon
Budget, 2023).

CO2e emissions and GDP growth per capita follow a similar path in the
BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) as well as
in Vietnam and Somalia (Raihan et al., 2024; Viana Espinosa De Oliveira
& Moutinho, 2022; Warsame et al., 2024).

#### Reducing the Gap Between Climate Science and Climate Economics

William Northaus won a Novel Prize in 2018 for attempting to combine
climate change and economics in a single, integrated assessment model,
named *Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy (DICE)*, however his
predictions are considered inaccurate by climate scientists,
underestimating the risk of catastrophic warming, tipping point and the
probability of higher temperatures leading to mass death (Jones &
Steffen, 2019; Kemp et al., 2022; Stern et al., 2022; Stern, 2022a; Y.
Xu & Ramanathan, 2017; **etchamWhenIdiotSavants2023?**).

-   Nordhaus (2013)
-   Institute of International and European Affairs (IIEA) (2023)
-   While discussion of sustainability economics is spread out over 100
    different scientific journals, there’s little interaction between
    research clusters. Elinor Ostrom vs William Nordhaus Drupp et
    al. (2020) found their analysis of research published between 1987
    to 2013.

## Greenwashing: Data-Driven Benchmarks

### The Problem of Greenwashing

Greenwashing is one of the largest blockers of sustainability. Both the
European Commission and the Chair of U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) Gary Gensler have called for more legislation to curb
business greenwashing practices. *“If it’s easy to tell if milk is
fat-free by just looking at the nutrition label, it might be time to
make it easier to tell if”green” or “sustainable” funds are really what
they say they are”* says Gensler (US Securities and Exchange Commission,
2022). EU regulation for standardizing sustainability reporting is
called the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) entered
into force in 2023 as is being gradually ramped up until 2027.

Green investing only makes sense if it’s possible to distinguish
sustainable investments from not sustainable ones. Humans feel as if
choosing green is useless and give up. Sustainabile investing is firstly
about changes in legislation which set stricter sustainability standards
on companies (as discussed above). Secondly, increased transparency, new
metrics, and new tools make it feasible to differentiate more
sustainable companies from less sustainable ones.

Wikirate currently lists 4282 metrics https://wikirate.org/Metric

![](_thesis_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-60-output-1.png)

Upcoming EU greenwashing legislation hopes to curb misleading
communications by companies. *“Make benchmark methodologies more
transparent when it comes to ESG & put forward standards for the
methodology of low-carbon and ESG benchmarks in EU”* (European
Commission, 2019b). Until new legislation is ramped up (2030 in the EU),
building consumer awareness is crucial as currently most
emission-reduction programs are voluntary and thus affected only by
consumer demand (André & Valenciano-Salazar, 2022). Greenwashing is
widespread in company social media communications (Geoffrey Supran,
2022). A number of new AI-based tools aim to find instances of
greenwashing. ClimateBert AI finds rampant greenwashing (Bingler et al.,
2021; Sahota, 2021).

While the EU has proposed legislation to curb greenwashing, EU climate
policy itself has been criticized for greenwashing. Sometimes
greenwashing comes under legislative protection Kira Taylor (2021).
(Booth, 2022) describes how “A recent investigation shows illegal
logging of protected areas in eastern European countries that supplies
residential wood pellets in Italy. Belgium, Denmark, and the Netherlands
are importing pellets from Estonia, where protected areas are logged for
pellets and the country has lost its forest carbon sink, despite
large-scale wood pellet plants being certified ‘sustainable’ by the
Sustainable Biomass Program”.

In recycling systems,(Purkiss et al., 2022) highlights the confusion
between compostable and biodegradable plastics and public
misunderstanding what happens to these plastics when they reach the
landfill: “\[m\]ost plastics marketed as”home compostable” don’t
actually work, with as much as 60% failing to disintegrate after six
months”. Shopping bags marketed as *biodegradable* don’t show
deterioration after 3 years in salt-water sea environment (Napper &
Thompson, 2019).

### Sustainability Standards

(International Trade Centre, 2022) currently lists 334 different
sustainability standards: “Towards a meaningful economy” “The world’s
largest database for sustainability standards”, “We provide free,
accessible, comprehensive, verified and transparent information on over
300 standards for environmental protection, worker and labor rights,
economic development, quality and food safety, as well as business
ethics.”

-   There are many standards.

-   Most sustainable companies. Make a database?

### Corruption

Put very simply (knowingly oversimplifying), in traditional finance
legislation is an enabler of corruption as in the case of Swiss privacy
laws, where illegal funds can be hidden, while in cryptocurrencies, the
lack of clear and comprehensive regulation is an enabler of corruption.

### Product Databases

In order to consider the sustainability on a product level, there should
be a directory of all the world’s products.

All of the world’s products are subject to one or another standard and
although they are not uniform, there’s some documentation existing about
every product. GS1 is the organization providing EAN/UPC barcodes on
most consumer products (GS1, n.d.).

-   Konrad (n.d.) “an internet-wide directory of purchasable products,
    reminiscent of how the much of the world’s music is made available
    on streaming platform Spotify.”

-   “Open Product Data” (n.d.): Open Knowledge Foundation’s Open Product
    Data website shut down

    -   *Datakick* (n.d.): “open product database”

    -   *WIPO GREEN* (n.d.) green tech database

    -   “Packaging World” (n.d.) packaging database

### Financialization

(Yüksel et al., 2023) criticizes excessive financialization for the 2008
economic crisis where the real economy and financial markets
disconnected, proposing a new index for *participation finance* aiming
to ground the financial economy in the real economy; rooted in Islamic
banking, participation finance avoids highly speculative activities,
which are seen as exploitative, looking to promote stability,
transparency, and fairness.

### Credit-Scoring

Companies assess customer’s credit score to decide credit-worthiness,
however inversely, how can customers rate companies? Indexes make
comparing companies possible. There are many-many indexes, scoring
systems, ratings, certifications, etc.

### Risk-Based Assessment

-   Frances Schwartzkopff (2022b) “Companies in industries with the
    biggest carbon footprints aren’t reporting how their emissions feed
    into financial risk, according to an analysis of corporate reports
    by the Carbon Tracker Initiative.”

-   BeZero is innovating in the voluntary carbon credit market (VCM) by
    providing risk-scoring, a language financial professionals are
    accustomed with.

### Indices

Sustainability indices need transparency and standardization (Bolognesi
et al., 2024).

### Certification

Research shows certification does matter. In Europe, consumers are
willing to pay more for bio-based products *“72% of Europeans are
willing to pay more for environmentally friendly products. The study
identifies a”green premium” and a “certified green premium,” indicating
increased WTP for bio-based and certified bio-based products”* (Morone
et al., 2021). Particulary in Italy, a study of consumer awareness of
sustainable supply chains shows Italian consumers have a strong
preference for antibiotic-free meat (Mazzocchi et al., 2022).

## ESG

### ESG (Promise): Countering Misinformation with Transparency

Since the 1970s, international bodies, governments, and private
corporations have developed sustainability measurement metrics, the
prominent one being ESG (Environmental, Social, and Corporate
Governance) developed by the UN in 2005. This rating system has already
been implemented or is in the process of being adopted on stock markets
all over the world and has implications beyond the stock markets,
allowing analysts to measure companies’ performance on the triple bottom
line: the financial, social, and environmental metrics.

ESG gives banks a new tool to market and sell environmentally conscious
opportunities to institutional investors, for example, universities - a
case in point being the recent partnership between HSBC and the
University of Edinburgh (Reid, 2020). Another recent example is one of
the largest private banks in Switzerland, Lombard Odier & Co, when they
launched a thematic bio-economy fund inspired by the words of The Prince
of Wales, ‘Building a sustainable future is, in fact, the growth story
of our time’ (Jersey Evening Post, 2020).

In Taiwan, the Taipei stock market has listed ESG stocks since 2017 and
was hailed by Bloomberg as a regional leader in ESG reporting (Grauer,
2017). In December 2017, the *FTSE4Good TIP Taiwan ESG Index* was
launched, which tracks ESG-rated companies on the Taipei stock market
(Taiwan Index, 2024). Nasdaq Nordic introduced an ESG index in 2018, and
Euronext, the largest stock market in Europe, introduced an ESG index
and a series of derivative instruments in the summer of 2020 (Euronext,
2020).

(*The Importance of ESG Measurement and Canada’s Opportunity for
Improvement*, 2022) suggests ACWI ESG leaders outperform the non-ESG
screened ACWI based on comparing MSCI indexes. It’s notable that ACWI
ESG starts to outperform the traditional ACWI only in the past few
years.

-   Nordic Climate Transparency Leadership analysis of Nasdaq OMX Nordic
    120 companies: “companies with higher quality climate reporting also
    provide higher returns”
-   Trucost, a company launched in 2000 to calculate the hidden
    environmental costs of large corporations and advance
    circular-economy practices was acquired in 2016 by S&P Dow Jones
    Indices, which by 2019 became a part of its ESG product offering
    (Indices, Oct 03, 2016, 08:30 ET; Mike Hower, Dec 9, 2015 7am EST;
    “S&P Rolls Out Trucost ESG Data to Its Customers,” 2019; Toffel &
    Sice, 2011). It’s parent company S&P Global also acquired
    RobecoSAM’s ESG rating business, consolidating S&P’s control of ESG
    ratings (George Geddes, 2019).

Sustainable Investing is Based on Data. Greenwashing is a large
detractor from environmental action as it’s difficult to know what is
sustainable and what is not. Greenwashing Disturbs Sustainable Capital
Allocation. Greenwashing erodes trust. Greenwashing has a negative
Impact on Credibility.

-   Ganu (2021)

### ESG (Tools)

“\[T\]hanks to other emerging technology like IoT sensors (to collect
ESG data) and blockchain (to track transactions), we have the
infrastructure to collect more data, particularly for machine
consumption. By measuring real-time energy usage, transportation routes,
manufacturing waste, and so forth, we have more quantifiable ways to
track corporations’ environmental performance without relying purely on
what they say.” (Sahota, 2021)

Google Environmental Insights Explorer enables local governments
(cities) to measure CO2 emissions and enact environmental policies that
optimize city functions such as traffic flows (*Methodology - Google
Environmental Insights Explorer - Make Informed Decisions*, n.d.; Nicole
Lombardo, 2021)

### ESG (Fintech)

In the U.S. and European banking sector (Dicuonzo et al., 2024)
performed an analysis of 180 banks’ data. Fintech Index and ESG Scores
have a positive correlation, suggesting the adoption of technology has a
statistically significant influence on better environmental stewardship,
social and governance quality. Even larger predictors of high ESG score
were than were Board Gender Diversity (Women on Board), the Size of the
Bank, and Board Independence (governance structures with more
independent directors could be more socially and environmentally
responsible). On the flip side, out of the initial 1551 banks considered
the majority did not have ESG data available to be able to perform the
comparison.

In China, (Lu & Li, 2023) finds *digitization* is the pathway to
Environmental Information Disclosure (EID) and Green Innovation.

### ESG (Governance)

Governance drives social and environmental initiatives at companies.

MSCI research finds company boards severely lacking in climate experts;
among the 164 large CO2 emitters benchmarks by the *Climate Action 100+*
alliance (Climate Action 100+, 2023; Sommer et al., 2024).

(Climate Action 100+, 2023) tracks large emitters around the world with
combined market cap of \$10.3 Trillion USD.

Majority of large emitters companies don’t have climate experts (Climate
Action 100+, 2023).

Most companies do not meet criteria (Climate Action 100+, 2023).

![](_thesis_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-68-output-1.png)

A systematic meta-review of 153 research papers of ESG literature around
the world reports the major determinants of high ESG performance are
board member diversity, firm size, and CEO attributes (Martiny et al.,
2024).

Shareholders can leverage their numbers and join forces in order to
affect the board members of large corporations. For example, the As Your
Sow NGO aims to champion CSR through building coalitions of shareholders
and taking legal action, including the Fossil Free Funds initiative
which researches and rates funds’ exposure to fossil fuels finance and
its sister project Invest in Your Values rates retirement plans offered
by employers (mostly US technology companies) (As You Sow, 2024a, 2024b)

### ESG (Crisis)

ESG companies don’t emit less CO2 than non-ESG companies.. ESG Criticism
“25 ESG ratings from three major providers (Moody’s Analytics, MSCI
Inc., and Refinitiv)” - *“well-rated companies do not emit significantly
less carbon than those with lower scores.”* (Amenc et al., 2023).

The lack of rigor is creating a backlash against ESG reporting.(C. Yu,
2021) reports ESG is filled with greenwashing. “Anti-ESG Crusade in US
Sweeps 15 States With More Laws in Works” (2023) several US states are
introducing regulation for ESGs to curb greenwashing. Frances
Schwartzkopff (2022a) suggests the ESMA and EU has strengthened
legislation to counter ESG greenwashing. Shashwat Mohanty (2022):
“sustainable funds don’t buy Zomato’s ESG narrative”. Bindman et al.
(2024) reports large ESG funds managed by BlackRock and Vanguard are
investing into JBS, a meat-packing company which is linked to
deforestation of the Amazon rainforest through it’s supply chain.

Three frameworks for corporate to think about ESG compliance is to
position their company on the MEET - EXCEED - LEAD scale based on the

### ESG (Methodologies)

-   ESG Needs Standardisation
-   Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG)

A meta-review of 136 research articles discovered the following
ESG-rating agencies.

-   “Disparity between ESG methodologies was one of the key hurdles to
    finding the right sustainable strategy” (Margaryta Kirakosian &
    Angus Foote, 2022).

### ESG (Language): Shared Language

ESG Becomes a Shared Language.

The advice consultancies are providing to banks establishes a common
language and helps banks to sell strategical alignment for long-term
institutional sustainability in terms of environmental, social, and
governance performance. PWC suggests *“asset managers educate their
staff and client base. ‘It will be critical to build stronger ESG
expertise among their employees by up-skilling existing staff on ESG
principles and strategically scout for and integrate more diverse and
ESG-trained talent’”* (PWC, 2020)

While ESG is riddled with problems, it has started a common language and
there are many ways how to improve it

-   For AI-powered assistants to be able to provide guidance, metrics
    are needed to evaluate sustainable assets, and ESG provides the
    current state-of-the-art for this. The largest obstacle to
    eco-friendly investing is greenwashing where companies and
    governments try to portray an asset as green when in reality it’s
    not. A personal investing assistant can provide an interface to
    focus on transparency, highlighting data sources and limitations, to
    help users feel in control of their investment decisions, and
    potentially even provide large-scale consumer feedback on negative
    practices back to the business through infringement discovery.

### ESG (Data Streams): Realtime Reporting

-   “But the real breakthrough is how we can surface that real-time ESG
    data directly to individuals in the shops and online, linked to the
    products that they are browsing and potentially buying. This means
    that ESG change will finally be driven by the ultimate judge of
    business success – the customer.” (Ratkovic, 2023)

There’s a growing number of companies helping businesses to measure CO2e
emissions in their product lifecycle.

-   Kyle Wiggers (2022) proposes makersite, instant sustainability
    impact from supply chain.

-   Makersite (n.d.) proposes ***product sustainability modeling***.

How are large corporations responding to the climate crisis?

Lack of leadership. (Capgemini, 2022): “Many business leaders see
sustainability as costly obligation rather than investment in the
future”.

The CEO of the Swedish clothing producer H&M - one of the largest
fast-fashion in the world -, recognizes the potential impact of
*conscious consumers* as a threat (Hoikkala, 2019).

Many large businesses have tried to find solutions by launching
climate-focused funding. (Korosec, 2021) reports that Amazon’s 2B USD to
a Climate Pledge Fund earmarked to fix climate problems is invested in
energy, logistics, and packaging startups, which will reduce material
waste. “Good intentions don’t work, mechanisms do,” Amazon’s founder
Bezos is quoted as saying in (Clifford, 2022). Walmart is taking a
similar approach, having launched a project in 2017 to set
CO<sub>2</sub> reduction targets in collaboration with its suppliers
(Walmart, 2023). These examples underline how money marketed as climate
funding by retail conglomerates means focus on reducing operational cost
of running their business through automation and material savings.

Large corporations such as Nestle and Coca Cola support the biodiversity
law to have a level playing field for business (Greens EFA, 2023).

    Environmental Quality – In order to have healthy communities, we

    experts which CO2 reduction methods among nature-based and
    technology-based are the most effective.

### ESG (Social): Slavery Still Exists

In 2023, an estimated 50 million people were in slavery around the
world; lack of supply chain visibility hides forced labor and
exploitation of undocumented migrants in agricultural work; 71% of
enslaved people are estimated to be women. (Borrelli et al., 2023; Kunz
et al., 2023). (Christ & V Helliar, 2021) estimates 20 million people
are *‘stuck inside corporate blockchains’*. The Global Slavery Index
measures the considerable *‘import risk’* of having slavery inside its
imports (Walk Free, 2023). (Hans van Leeuwen, 2023) slavery affects
industries from fashion to technology, including sustainability enablers
such as solar panels. ILO estimates 236 billion USD are generated in
illegal profits from forced labor (International Labour Organization,
2024).

The Modern Slavery Act has been passed in several countries starting
with the U.K. in 2015 (UK Parliament, 2024). (Mai et al., 2023) finds
the quality of the reporting remains low among FTSE 100 (index of highly
capitalized listings on the London Stock Exchange) companies.

On the global level, the United Nations SDG target 8.7 targets to
eliminate all forms of slavery by 2025 however progress has been slow
(The Minderoo Foundation & Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, 2020).

Voters in Switzerland rejected the responsible business initiative in
2020 while the country is a global hub for trading commodities.
“Switzerland has a hand in over 50% of the global trade in coffee and
vegetable oils like palm oil as well as 35% of the global volume of
cocoa, according to government estimates”(Anand Chandrasekhar & Andreas
Gefe, 2021) begging the question can Swiss traders have more scrutiny
over what they trade?

![](_thesis_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-74-output-1.png)

Slavery is connected to environmental degradation, and climate change
(Decker Sparks et al., 2021). Enslaved people are used in environmental
crimes such as 40% of deforestation globally. Cobalt used in
technological products is in risk of being produced under forced labor
in the D.R. Congo (Sovacool, 2021). In India and Pakistan, forced labor
in brick kiln farms is possible to capture remotely from satellite
images (Boyd et al., 2018). In effect, the need for cheap labor turns
slavery into a *subsidy* keeping environmental degradation happening.

### ESG (Social): How to Trace Worker’s Rights

While reducing slavery in the supply chain sets very low bar for ESG,
another aspect of supply tracing is the treatment of workers and working
conditions.

-   “commodification of human beings”

-   Companies that intend to to give supply chain a voice” by connecting
    workers directly to the consumer (even in anonymously, to protect
    the workers from retribution), include *CTMFile* and *Alexandria*.

    -   “Worker Voice” (2022) Worker Voice apps.
    -   Tim Nicolle (2021) and PrimaDollar Media (2021) PrimaDollar
        Realtime ESG Give supply chain a voice by connecting workers
        directly to the consumer.

# Methodology

Start with expert survey, then expert interviews (because so many
questions from literature review).

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[69] }} />

I adopted a face-to-face method to increase response rates distributing
flyers to students on college campuses, canteens, and classrooms getting
verbal permission from educators in their ´ classrooms to distribute the
survey flyer. The flyer included a colorful AI-generated visual with a
futuristic game-link female figure, the title “climate anxiety survey”,
a website link (ziran.tw) and scannable QR-code.

Similarly to (C.-H. Liu et al., 2023) I distributed the survey in
schools in the Northern, Soutern, Central, and East regions of Taiwan.

The survey only included questions and descriptions in Chinese. I have
used the Claude 3 Opus model to translate them to english for this
table.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[70] }} />

Respondents who remained outside the survey parameters were disregarded
from the data analysis.

## Research Design

-   Christian Rohrer (2022): Research methods

**The research design of this study consists of 3 steps.**

-   Qualitative research targeted at financial and interaction design
    experts, leading to a *wish list* of features.
-   Survey potential users’ preferences, including a choice experiment
    of the proposed features.
-   Design a prototype of the personal sustainable finance AI assistant,
    tested using qualitative methods in a focus group.
-   This mixed-method research design is divided into three stages
    (fig. 11).
-   My purpose for the first qualitative stage is to explore the general
    themes arising from the literature review related to the design of
    AI advisors for investing. I will identify specific user experience
    factors, through interviewing experts in financial technology and
    user experience design and reviewing existing applications on the
    marketplace. At this stage in the research, the central concept
    being studied is defined generally as expectations towards a
    sustainable investment AI advisor.
-   I will then proceed to the second, quantitative stage, informed by
    the previously identified factors, and prepare a survey, including a
    Likert scale, and a choice experiment, focusing on the preferences
    of the potential users aged 18-35, living in Sweden and Taiwan (see
    fig. 12 on next page), exploring the relationship between
    independent variables: - “Interest in Sustainability” - “Interest in
    Investing” - “Preferred Features” - and the dependent variable “User
    Sign-ups”.
-   In the third stage, I will return to the qualitative methods, by
    building a prototype of the sustainable investing AI companion,
    taking into account insights gathered in the previous stage. I will
    use a focus group to discuss the prototype, and conduct a thematic
    analysis of the discussions’ recordings, leading to further
    validation of previously gathered data and possible changes in the
    prototype. The gained insights, accompanied by the app prototype,
    which embodies my findings, will be the final outcome of my
    research.

## Conceptual Framework

-   The conceptual framework map (fig. 13) presents the key concepts
    arising from the literature review thus far in the research process.
    I’m using these concepts when developing interview strategies for
    phase one of the research, developing the survey questionnaire for
    phase two, as well as for building the Personal Sustainable AI
    Financial Advisor (PSAA) for young adults at the final stage of the
    process. However, I expect the conceptual framework to further
    evolve with additional findings while conducting my research.

Conceptual Model

## Research Methods

### Phase One - Qualitative Research

The qualitative research methods employed in the first stage of the
research design enables me to explore concepts arising for literature
review further, using a more open approach, without limiting the
conversation only to pre-ascribed notions. The strength of the
qualitative approach in the first stage is to encourage the discovery of
new ideas, not yet common in literature and potential user experience
factors related to sustainable investing and user experience.

#### Sampling

My qualitative sampling structure uses non-probability snowball
sampling, with the following criteria: financial industry, fintech, and
design experts everywhere, including in Taiwan and Sweden, but also
Estonia, Portugal, and elsewhere.

**Method:** Semi-Structured Interviews

I will conduct exploratory research in English using semi-structured
interviews recorded online and offline.

### Phase Two - Quantitative Research

The strength of quantitative research is to enable me to access a larger
sample of potential users in two countries, using online survey methods,
and to validate some of the qualitative findings from stage one.

**Sampling** My quantitative sampling structure uses a judgmental
criterion: age 18-35, located in Sweden or Taiwan, surveyed using an
English-language online survey.

**Method:** Likert The survey includes a Likert scale between 1 to 7 to
validate key findings from the first stage of the research by assessing
responses to statements regarding the app’s design, features, and other
criteria that may still emerge.

**Method:** Choice Experiment The survey includes a choice experiment
between different sets of potential features available when
communicating with the sustainable finance AI companion.

### Phase Three - Qualitative Research

In the last phase, I will return to the qualitative methods to further
validate the quantitative findings from stage two. Here my focus will be
on operationalizing the gathered insights into a prototype that users
can experiment with and discuss with their peers in a focus group
setting. Sampling

The phase three sampling structure uses a judgmental criterion: - age
18-35 - located in Taiwan - Using the English language for discussion

A focus group of 6 to 10 people will be gathered in Tainan. Because
in-person presence is required in this stage, the prototype will only be
tested by potential users physically present in Taiwan. To avoid
convenience sampling, I will post online ads in English to invite people
who I don’t know personally, to participate in a “financial AI
application testing group” (wording may change).

**Method:** Focus Group The strength of a focus group is the ability to
observe potential users in a social setting, where knowledge can be
exchanged between the participants. The whole experience, including
emerging conversations, will be recorded and transcribed.

**Method:** Thematic Analysis Finally, I will perform a thematic
analysis of the focus group transcriptions in order to validate previous
findings, and open avenues for future research.

## Ideas for Interfaces / Scenarios {#ideas-for-interfaces-scenarios}

Show all the different prototypes just likes architects do. And then
defend why I chose the one I did. For NW make a Loom with the interfaces
and talk about them?

## Prototypes of Product Features

I developed a number of early prototypes to visualize product feature
ideas.

What’s on the intersection of College Students, Sustainability,
Investing, Data-Driven Design and Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
AI-Driven Sustainable Investment Tools.

The app aims to address the market failure by providing consumers
sufficient sustainability information on the goods, services and
investments.

resource depletion

and adopt the doughnut economy as my overarching theoretical framework

Humans are successful because of our adaptability. The study suggests
tools to adapt to our current reality.

United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration

Hypothesis: extractive business practices reduce college students trust,
regenerative business practices create trust among college students
towards the company.

Provided there is awareness

How can sustainability-minded college students find companies that meet
their expectations, standards and requirements?

-   Make a public profile of my carbon consumption!!! Like on Commons.

-   Shop

-   Save

-   Invest

-   Build closer relationships with sustainability-focused companies

-   Sales funnel for eco-focused products

-   The eco-friendly market is fragmented

-   Build trust, clarity, transparency, and honesty

-   Make a ‘Sustainability Flywheel’ graphic, like that of Amazon’s

-   Sustainability is fragmented. How can billions of people build
    closer relationships with sustainability-focused companies based on
    honesty and transparency? A research project for designing a
    sustainable shopping, savings, and investing companion.

-   Most sustainability plans rely on carbon credits to achieve their
    goals, making carbon credits a single point of failure. If the
    credits are not accurate, the whole system collapses.

-   TODO: Make a table showing research results translated to design
    decisions

-   Your Green Helper

-   Make some initial prototype? make YoutTbe video… hi, you have
    reached? spread… through ESTBan and others?

-   Currently CO<sub>2</sub> footprint calculators ask you a couple of
    questions and give a ballpark estimate. Does it make sense to track
    sustainability on a more nuanced level, like Apple Health, in order
    to encourage sustainable behavior?

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[71] }} />

-   *Affinity diagrams* help users organize ideas by brainstorming,
    sorting and labeling to cluster related information (Kara Pernice,
    2018; Quignard, 2022)
-   Scan a product to see the company and start investing or divesting
    from them Current economics is lowering the quality of life on the
    planet

Actionable Insights: Translate data into everyday actions the app can
suggest.

-   What does investing look like at the scale of billions of people?
    like IG
-   The most effective things are Commodities? Food, transport, fashion,
    plant trees.

## Shopping-as-Investing

-   Introduce this concept

-   The Manor (2022)

-   Sustainability is hard. Green Filter helps you find companies that
    are making a true effort and build closer relationships through
    shopping, savings, and investing. Green Filter helps you find
    companies that are making a true effort to become sustainable and
    build closer relationships through shopping, savings, and investing

-   Gather requirements and build a prototype for the next-generation
    investment app for young adults. Improving the user experience for
    young adults getting started with (green) investing. What would a
    “Tinder for (Green) Investments” look like? How can we make the
    logistics of investing so easy to use and take into account my
    values?

-   My thesis core message is : everyone should change from consumer to
    sustainability investor (define these terms in the thesis). how to
    do this? can help you become from consumer to investor i believe
    there’s space for a product like that. your green investing friend
    find the companies tackling certain problems and invest in them
    using crypto business can be a force for good

-   Consumer purchases are an indicator of demand. If demand trends
    down, companies will stop producing this product.

## ‘Investment-as-Product’

-   Green Filter helps you discover how to save money and the planet
    with your daily shopping. By providing an easy way for people to
    learn about and shop with sustainable companies, we imagine a world
    where people invest in their future, find great deals on
    responsibly-made products, and get useful discounts from socially
    responsible brands.

-   GreenFilter is a product that combines AI, design and marketing to
    help people manage their social impact throughout the stages of
    their lives, from young adult years to retirement. Its primary goal
    is to give people the tools they need to invest responsibly in
    sustainable companies, while also educating them on this topic. Our
    project offers a responsive website and mobile app that leverages AI
    and other advanced technologies. In addition, our prototype includes
    a reality-based virtual assistant with voice command capabilities
    which can provide customers with new insights into the world of
    green finance

-   GreenFilter introduces a novel, interactive point-of-sale technology
    that helps people make greener shopping decisions. The platform uses
    artificial intelligence to suggest green alternatives for products
    on your shopping list, and will also help you to find other
    companies that can make sustainable versions of the product you are
    buying.

-   As people become aware of the impact their shopping is having on the
    environment, they become interested in finding alternatives to big
    brands and large companies. GreenFilter provides designers an AI
    companion design which helps people build relationships with
    sustainability-focused companies by providing personalized
    recommendations, giving product reviews and helping them shop
    sustainably. This new tool will empower consumers to make greener
    choices throughout their lives.

-   Better management of planet Earth

-   How can wee Shop, Save, Invest in line ecologic principles and
    planetary boundaries? individual action doesn’t move the needle. how
    to group together

-   App to build community

-   Life within planetary boundaries

-   Currently it seems there’s a secret around how things are produced
    we want to increase transparency

-   Companies that have nothing new nothing to hide should welcome this
    opportunity to mark themselves to keep a conscious consumers and
    investors.

-   We want to create competition around sustainable practices enter
    widespread adoption

-   Cigarettes and pictures of lung cancer every product should be
    required to have photos of production conditions switch such as
    Rainforest and deforestation the products that include Palm oil.

-   My thesis is that a lot of people want to do good, shop
    eco-friendly, invest green, etc. But they don’t believe the
    solutions work. They don’t have trust. This is a user interface
    issue. How to build trust.

## Early Feature Ideas

The following early prototypes are focused on particular feature ideas
that occurred to me during the literature review process. They are naive
and meant to allow thinking in terms of *what-if* a particular user
experience was possible. These prototypes were not tested with users
directly and formed a basis for directing the questions asked in a
potential user survey.

## Susan (Sustainability Conversation)

*What if* I could have a chat like this at the supermarket? Imagine what
questions I would ask before buying a product. AI: “Kris, do you still
remember Coca Cola’s packaging is a large contributor to ocean plastic?
You even went to a beach cleanup!” Me: “That’s so sad but it’s tasty!”
AI. “Remember your values. Would you like to start saving for investing
in insect farms in Indonesia instead? Predicted return 4% per year,
according to analysts A and B.” If I’m not so sure, I could continue the
conversation. Me: “Tell me more” AI: “A recent UN study says, the planet
needs to grow 70% more food in the next 40 years. Experts from 8
investment companies predict growth for this category of assets.” Me:
“Thanks for reminding me who I am” … Moments later. AI: “This shampoo is
made by Unilever, which is implicated in deforestation in Indonesia
according to reporting by World Forest Watch. Would you consider buying
another brand instead? They have a higher ESG rating.”

Example Suggestions of the AI companion:

-   “Don’t buy a car, use a car sharing service instead to save XYZ CO2.
    Service available near you: Bolt,\* Uber.”

-   “Use a refillable shampoo bottle to save XYZ plastic pollution”

-   “Call your local politician to nudge them to improve bicycle paths
    and reduce cars in your neighborhood. Over the past 2 years, you
    city has experienced an increase of cars from 290 cars per capita to
    350 cars per capita.”\*

Figure 3: Speculative scenario of an interaction between a human user
and a robo-advisor through the interface of chat messages in the context
of retail shopping for daily products.

## Sunday Market

*What if* I could go to the Sunday market with other people who care
about sustainability? First prototype (based on literature review)
called HappyGreen’s for going to the organic Sunday Market with friends.
Choose industries of focus? Fashion, Food, etc?

## Speak Truth to Power

*What if* I could affect companies with truth? Consolidate user feedback
for companies.

## How Far?

*What if* I knew how far did this product travel to reach me?

## Know Your Company

*What if* I could KYC the companies I interact with? Like the banks KYC,
consumers can KYC.

## CO2e Flex

*What if* I could show off how much CO2e I have retired?

## Sustainability Watch

*What if* I could see all my sustainability data on a wearable device in
the right context?

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[72] }} />

## Narrative Layouts

*What if* I spent 5 minutes every day with a guide who could help me
make more eco-friendly choices? How should the layout storyline be
structured? Well it’s like Strava (that running app) for sustainability…
or if you have heard of Welltory. I believe sustainable choices that
would improve my life.. be it what I consume, save, invest, etc.. so I’m
trying to design an app around this idea. I’m basically building the UX
of AI.. focused on sustainability. How should the layout storyline be
structured? Well it’s like Strava (that running app) for sustainability…

1 may prof suggestion - make connection between biodibersity and
production and consumption clearer - what is the incentive for companies
to share their data?

my own idea: like the switch of going from traditional banking with ATM
machines on the street (or even the physica bank office) to online
banking with mobile payments

-   hypothesis: esg accessibility can push companies to increase
    production standards

-   what if you can see ESG in near-realtime such as the stock market
    price

-   i can imagine esg derivative product like siemens gamesa

-   ai can help integrate esg derivatives into daily life to drive esg
    adoption

-   “effective altruism (EA)”

-   “Blockchain technology can improve price transparency in product
    distribution by allowing consumers to know the exact pricing from
    raw materials to distributors to suppliers.”

-   

Interviews and testing survey were conducted anonymously in hopes to
have more honest responses from the responders.

-   ziran chrome extension is unable to record activity due to browser
    security restrictions for plugins
-   ai.ziran.tw record user activity
-   semi-structured interviews were conducted in chinese
-   the interviewer (me) took notes of the interviews
-   some gaps in the data exist due to the limited chinese language
    skills of the interviewer (me)

basic interview script - momo: what is a brand that you like’d or would
like to buy - search - please pick a product (or search again) - on
product page: what do you notice on this page? - what kind of
information is important for you on this page? - do you notice anything
else - (if the user doesn’t notice the green filter, direct their
attention to it and ask: what do you think this does?) - would you click
on it - if the user says yes, continue - if thhe user says no, make note
and continue - as the extension generates a response: what do you think
about this content? - is there any information that you consider
important? - anything else you see that you think looks special - do you
see anywhere you can click? - would you click on it? - if yes,
continue - if no, make note, and continue - explain: due to the
limitation of the prototype, the test will continue on a separate page
where you can ask questions - is there anything you would like to ask
the helper? - notice if the user picks from sample questions - remind
the user they can come up with their own question - as the ai is
generating content ask: do you see any information in this content - did
you know this before or is there any info you didn’t know before? make
note. - front page: explain the helper takes into account your personal
info and goals. - ask: what kind of information do you think important
to share with the helper?

-   Simplify text

-   Use images

-   Put a “New Feature” ad on the front page

-   Change 繼續討論 to something more actionable

    -   I tried changing to “see alternatives”

Face-to-face testing was concluded in several universities across Taiwan

-   Taichung, 1 uni

-   Pingdong, 1 uni

-   Tainan, 2 uni

Interviews were conducted in Chinese and transcribed and translated to
English using Google Voice to Text AI as well as Describe AI.

# Results

Expected Findings

During the preparation of this research proposal I conducted a
preliminary round of facetoface interviews using 21 openended probing
questions using a convenience sampling of NCKU students on campus
between ages 19 and 29 a total of 12 respondents The interviews lasted
between 9 and 21 minutes and were conducted to get some initial feedback
on my research idea the respondents daily routines app usage feelings
towards financial questions including investing relationship with nature
and environmental sustainability These preliminary conversations led me
to emphasize more on the financial journey ie to consider the importance
of the shopping savings and payments apps students already use daily
which could serve as an entry point to becoming an investor I expect my
future research findings to confirm this initial idea and offer diverse
ways and examples of what that path could look like in practice

Survey Overview

A survey of Taiwanese college students excludes overseas Chinesespeaking
students as well as foreign students covering attitudes towards shopping
saving investing economy nature sustainability and AI

Survey Oct 13th Nov 3rd 2023

2000 cards with a QR code printed out

Distribution conducted at 8 universities handing out the cards

1289 people started the survey 518 quit

771 people completed the whole survey

Data after filtering 675 people aged 18-26 GenZ Taiwanese current
students in BA large majority MA small minority or PhD level very few
respondents

36 likert fields 5point scale used for clustering the students into 3
personas with Kmeans clustering

14 product features multiplechoice used for Kmodes clustering

4 choice experiments

2 option ranking questions

10 text fields used to enrich the personas

Data Analysis

KMeans clustering for survey data Kmeans clustering is similar to vector
distances for similarity used in largelanguage models LLMs word
embeddings and deep learning

Findings

Literature AI assistants should integrate with Digital Product Passports
Literature AI assistants should show carbon label data Literature AI
assistants should avoid taking ESG at face value because its a really
low bar and integrate other metrics such as B Corp Literature AI
assistants should Literature Do not make another investing app make a
sustainability filter for excising investing platforms Literature
College students can support extended producer responsibility

How might AI assistants empower regenerative shopping saving and
investing

Display the ESG EPR BCorp etc etc credentials for each product and
investment EPR and BCorp are success stories which should be highlighted
while ESG is largely discredited There are many existing and ongoing
approaches to sustainability The best approach might be to plug into
excising system and communities and legislation to support and empower
them

How might one design an intuitive sustainable shopping saving investing
app

Apple Watch app

What app features might college students rate as the highest priority

Autopilot

How might one visualize ecological impact in digital product design

Accuracy is more important for human trust than actual impact

95,9% used a mobile device, 75,5% using an iOS device iPhone, 20,8%
using an Android device design implication should design mobile app but
apple is so restrictive

RQ 1

the AI companion is informed by the latest scientific insights and can
provide accurate evidencebased recommendations The AI is designed to
offer personalized guidance by analyzing complex environmental data and
translating it into userfriendly information helping students make more
sustainable choices in their daily lives It explores various AI
interaction designs including chatbots voice assistants and virtual
avatars to find the most engaging and supportive formats for college
students address the attitudebehavior gap among college students by
providing tools that make sustainable financial actions more convenient
and impactful

RQ 2

provide realtime information about the sustainability of products and
companie AI companion includes features for identifying and investing in
sustainable companies This involves providing data on companies
environmental social and governance ESG practices and facilitating
investments in green bonds and sustainable funds shoppingasinvesting
where the AI links the act of purchasing sustainable products with
investing in companies that produce these products effectively merging
consumer and investor roles

## Personas

### Clustering Students to Build 3 Personas

Personas are created using K-means clustering, an unsupervised machine
learning algorithm, which clusters college students based on their
responses across 36 Likert-scale fields in the online survey. Clusters
are visualized using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), where the
principal component loadings on the X and Y axes represent the weights
of the original Likert-scale fields, transformed into the principal
components that capture the most variance.

-   There is some similarity between clusters. All 3 personas report a
    high level of financial anxiety and below-average satisfaction with
    their financial literacy.

-   Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to convert data to lower
    dimension space. This is a predecessor of embeddings.

    as user expectations for a sustainable investment app.

-   What are my hypotheses?

-   User experiments

-   Financial statistics

-   Analyzing existing apps and user pain-points

-   List of topics gleaned from literature review for discussion with
    the experts:

-   Transparency and sources of ESG and similar data

-   I will test the prototype with potential users using an online
    choice experiment survey.

-   Research Process In terms of literature review, academic inquiry in
    social sciences largely follows phenomena, while the issues and
    technologies discussed here are emergent. Not many studies exist yet
    (they might in a few years), which is why some of my references are
    to company press releases and news stories, or for public companies,
    their advisory for investors.

-   Target potential retail investors aged 20-29, all genders, in
    countries with highly developed financial markets and active social
    campaigns demanding sustainability (Sweden). And Taiwan. In general,
    the Taiwanese culture is savings oriented: I’m in a good location
    for financial user experience research.

-   Set your target goals

-   Access to health care

-   Access to education

-   Climate action

I propose *interfaces* and *workflows* to see financial interactions
through the filter of sustainability.

What kind of sustainability info do college students care about? How
would college students prefer to interact with the AI? What role would
college students prefer the AI to take? How can college students trust
AI? What can college students do to aid sustainability efforts? How
might AI assistants help college students find shopping, saving, and
investing opportunities?

“Systemic change through financial actions driving policy and market
changes encourage broader industry shifts towards greener practices”.

Overconsumption-driven extractive business practices contribute to the
degradation of Earth’s natural ecosystems, pollution of water, air, and
soil, deforestation, diminishing biodiversity, climate instability,
extreme weather, modern slavery, worsening human health, and other
environmental and social challenges (ADD CITATION). Companies are
attuned to consumer demand however widespread greenwashing makes it
tiring to find sustainability-focused companies and requires extensive
time for research. Even for highly motivated people, it’s difficult to
know what’s sustainable.

My interest lies in understanding how AI assistants can help conscious
consumers become sustainable investors. The purpose of this study is to
explore how to provide the best user experience to potential sustainable
financial AI companion users. In their sustainability report every
company looks perfect. How can people shop, save and invest sustainably?
Where does our money go and what are some greener alternatives? The
companion enables people to be more transparent and responsible in their
consumption behavior.

In Taiwan water is too polluted can’t swim

air is too dirty can’t breather (show my own stats)

Ask chatgpt how to organize my sections

rq: how to connect env destruction pollution to source causes

rq: how to connect everyday financial actions to environmental impact in
a visual/ meaningful way

idea came riding my bike in annan can’t swim in yhe annan river

show local pollution map?

show factories on the map

instead of the browser pluging just make a website where you can share
the link of the product (and cache rhe results)

on ios can use the share screen to share to the app?

ICID calls upon us to have the courage to redesign entire industries

This research takes place at the intersection of Taiwanese college
students, sustainability, finance, AI, and design.

For the average person like myself, my experience with money is mostly
limited to buying things at the supermarket. Food, clothes, furniture,
soap, mobile phone. This leaves very few options on how to start with
something new like saving and investing.

Could the Green Supermarket become the entry point to Green Savings and
Green Investing?

Oboarding more people for sustainable practices is a complex interaction
design issue hindered by ambiguous data (what is sustainable?) and messy
human motivations (we love buying things).

What can people who want to preserve Earth’s environment, exactly do?
How can networks of people come together?

— LLMs enable data journalists to create stories: Big Local News (2024)

Health tracking apps paired with connected devices such as Apple Watch
filled with sensors provide one model for simple interactions to
dynamically track digital health data - also known as a quantified self.
This data allows apps to provide tips how to improve health outcomes
through small daily actions such as climbing more stairs. Small
interactions allow users to align their goals with their actions.

What would be a good interface to track sustainability? What is the user
interface at scale, useful for billions of people?

One way to influence societal outcomes is to decide where to put our
money. While our financial decisions are a vote towards the type of
businesses we want to support, is it enough?

While some people are demanding sustainability, and some governments and
companies are announcing green investment opportunities, how can
consumers discover the most suitable investment options for their
situation?

How can retail investors access and differentiate between eco-friendly
sustainability-focused investable assets?

The level of knowledge of and exposure to investing varies widely
between countries and people.

Could linking green consumption patterns with sustainable investing
provide another pathway to speed up achieving climate justice as well as
personal financial goals?

In this simplified scenario, I’m in a physical offline store, doing some
shopping. When putting a bottle of Coca Cola in my basket, my AI
companion Susan will ask me a personalized question:

Does individual climate action help?

Gen-Z college students (target users) may not have the capital to make a
financial dent today however they can be early adopter and they will be
the decision-makers in a few years.

“Like climate change, the focus on individual actions as a solution is
often misplaced, though it remains a focus of media and industry. For
decades, the petrochemical industry has offloaded responsibility onto
individuals through promoting concepts such as the”carbon footprint”,
championed in a 2004 advertising campaign by British Petroleum” Lavers
et al. (2022).

Individual efforts are too small to matter unless they’re inspired by
Community a effort

atmospheric pollution and climate change

The latest IPCC report Calvin et al. (2023)

Dimock (2019)

-   Latvian Kora app for tracking personal CO2 footprint, Earn KORA
    coins for reducing CO2 emissions (Kora Sustainability, 2019).

### Google Chrome Extenstion

While Google is the most popular browser with 3 billion users,
extentions are a relatively less knwn feature of the browser. Most
popular extenstions are Grammarly, for Taiwanese students End Note is
familiar.

However it’s only available for computers (extenntiions don’t run on
phones and tablets).

## Results

The research helps me (and others) to

-   Avoid reinventing the wheel and duplicating existing approaches.

-   It aims to help app developers maximize impact by aiding
    complementary additionality.

-   Make high-quality products. If used wisely, money can help build
    communities of sustainable impact.

Define every word in the title: “The Journey from Consumer to Investor:
Designing a Financial AI Companion for Young Adults to Help with
Sustainable Shopping, Savings, and Investing”

-   Journey - behavioral change takes time
-   Consumer - purchase goods without thinking about the effect
-   Investor - thinking about the return
-   Design - decisions
-   Financial - dealing with money
-   AI Companion - automated sidekick
-   Young Adults - College Students
-   Help - to be of assistance
-   Sustainable Shopping - shopping understanding the consequences
-   Sustainable Saving - in this context I mean Sustainable Savings,
    that is reducing one’s environmental footprint
-   Sustainable Investing - activity of thinking longer-term

## User Survey

-   Factorial Surveys (T. Li et al., 2022): “Factorial surveys is a
    research method that combines classical experiments with survey
    methodologies. Factorial surveys use short narratives, called
    vignettes, to represent various levels of independent variables that
    are too complex or unethical to create and manipulate in real-world
    or lab situations”

and a including a choice experiment between potential feature sets in
consumption, savings, and investment.

Start with a simple but powerful question: — Does it matter what you
buy? — Does it matter how much you save? — Does it matter where you
invest? Why?

## Research Limitations

First, finance is a highly regulated industry and the proposed user
experience designs may be limited by legal requirements. This study does
not take such limitations into account, rather focusing only on the user
experience.

This work is focused on user experience design and does attempt to make
a contribution to economics.

ESG data is expensive so couldn’t be used in this research. ESG needs
data to give us an accurate understanding of the realities inside
companies and the user experience design does not address the underlying
data quality problem further than by providing a link to the data
source.

I don’t have access to user financial data.

-   Research Reason: While many people are working on AI models, there’s
    a lack of people working on “Human-AI interaction”. Sustainability
    is the context. How can we better team up to solve the challenges we
    face this century? The huge externalities.

## Future Research

The literature is rich and there is ample space for future research. The
following includes some suggestions for authors whose work deserves a
deeper look.

-   Does the specialized interface offer any advantages of a general UI
    such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Mistral, and others?

Some ideas for fruitful research directions

-   Perception of pollution levels among Taiwanese college students.

-   RQ: Does AI acceptance increase with Affective Computing?

台灣設計研究院（TDRI ） on Instagram: "▌北歐循環設計論壇 開放報名中 -
近幾年，全球的極端氣候造成各地災害頻傳，人們更加意識到要珍惜地球資源，丹麥從10幾年前就開始推行低碳生活，哥本哈根海洋上成排的風力發電機供應丹麥20%以上的能源，哥本哈根的學校建造出全世界最大的太陽能板，甚至丹麥的設計團隊進行設計皆從永續環境為本心出發，在丹麥，每一個生活環節都是循環設計！ -
但丹麥談的循環永續不只是不具經濟效益的理念，循環經濟對丹麥來說不僅具有環境層面的效益，還可提升企業的競爭力，對資源生產力、就業機會、資源供應安全和自然資源的可持續利用都有極正向的回饋。 -
本次國際論壇，我們邀請來自丹麥的設計師Ditte Lysgaard
Vind從循環經濟策略、Rosa N<span class="nocase">ø</span>ss
Bendixen從產品設計、Helene
Jensen從時尚產業、更有台灣的團隊奇想創造、光寶科技、REnato
