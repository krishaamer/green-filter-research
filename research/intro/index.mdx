# Introduction

## Research Background

<Figure caption="Climate protest in Geneva on 27th September, 2019" src={Geneve} refURL="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gr%C3%A8veClimatGen%C3%A8ve-27sept2019-041-RuesBasses.jpg" refTitle="Wikimedia Commons" />

In 1896, the Nobel Prize winner Svante Arrhenius first calculated how an increase in CO2 levels would have a warming effect on our global climate. 120 years later, in 2016, the Paris Agreement came into effect, with countries agreeing on non-binding climate targets, which we are failing to meet. In August 2018, Greta Thunberg skipped school to start a climate strike in front of the Swedish parliament Riksdag. Millions of people joined Fridays for Future protests around the world[^1] and Time magazine named Thunberg person of the year in 2019 for *creating a global attitudinal shift*[^2]. Awareness of Earth's operating systems grew. Meanwhile, emissions kept rising. By January 2022, the Stockholm Resilience Centre reported that humanity had breached 4 out of our 9 planetary boundaries. In addition to climate change, biodiversity loss, land-system change, and biogeochemical flows. Given these facts, what can people who want to preserve Earth's human-friendly environment, exactly do?

How can networks of people come together to reduce traffic, deforestation, support mobility and green builings? One way to influence societal outcomes is to decide where to put our money. What is the user interface at scale, useful for billions of diverse users to make a meaningful impact? While our financial decisions are a vote towards the type of businesses we want to support, it's not enough to ***switch to green***.

For the average person, our experience is limited with buying things at the supermarket. Food, clothes, furniture, soap, mobile phone. 

- Green Supermarket
- Green Savings
- Green Investing

I grew up reading science fiction books in the 1990s and their influence on my outlook towards future possibilities continues until present day. Star Trek has a portable device called a ***tricorder*** (fig. 1), which enables imagined future humans fix all kinds of problems from scanning for minerals inside a cave to scanning human bodies for medical information. I would love to have such a device for consumer choices and financial decisions - to know what to buy and which businesses to do business with. Robots are already part of our lives; this thesis proposal was partially written using Google's and Apple's Voice recognition software, allowing me to transcribe notes with the help of an AI assistant. As a foreigner living in Taiwan, I've relied extensively on Google Maps' AI assistant to move around efficiently, including to find food and services. Even when we don't realize it, AI assistants are already helping us with many mundane tasks, and while it takes incredibly complex computational algorithms to achieve this in the background, it's become so commonplace, we don't even think about it. From this point of view, another AI assistant to help us with greener shopping decisions linked to eco-friendly investing doesn't sound so much of a stretch.

As introduced in the Abstract, this research is timely in 2020 because of the convergence of four trends, out of which I'll focus here on two: the current environmental upheaval, led by Generation Z, followed by Millennials, and the business adaptation (or lack thereof) to sustainable economic models, taking into account the hidden social and environmental costs we didn't calculate in our pricing before. The award-winning economist Mariana Mazzucato argues we have to include more into how we value unpaid labor (Gupta, 2020), the social (S in ESG). We also need to consider environmental effects (E in ESG). We haven't taken into account the whole cost of production, leading to the wrong pricing information. To achieve this, we need expert governance (G).

Given these 4 trends: 
- Youth demand for sustainability
- Intergenerational money transfer to the youth 
- AI user interface availability
- ESG instruments

## Research Motivation
First, while young people are demanding sustainability, and progressive governments and companies are increasingly announcing green investment opportunities, how can consumers discover the most suitable investment options for their situation? How can potential sustainability-focused retail investors access and differentiate between eco-friendly investable assets? The level of knowledge of and exposure to investing varies widely between countries. According to a Calastone study surveying 3000 ‘Millennial’ people between ages 23 and 35 in Europe (UK, France, Germany), U.S.A., Hong Kong, and Australia, 48% of respondents located in Hong Kong owned financial securities (such as stocks or shares) in comparison with just 10% in France (Calastone, 2020). 

Secondly, could linking green consumption patterns with sustainable investing provide another pathway to speed up achieving climate justice as well as personal financial goals? For example, in this simplified scenario, I'm in a physical offline store, doing some shopping. When putting a bottle of Coca Cola in my basket, my ***financial AI advisor Susan*** (fig. 2, above) will ask me a personalized question (fig. 3, next page):

<Figure caption="Figure 2 - Early prototype of my Sustainable Finance AI Companion" src={Susan} />

AI: "Kris, do you still remember Coca Cola's packaging is a large contributor to ocean plastic? You even went to a beach cleanup!"
Me: "That's so sad but it's tasty!"
AI. "Remember your values. Would you like to start saving for investing in insect farms in Indonesia instead? Predicted return 4% per annum, according to analysts A and B."
If I'm not so sure, I could continue the conversation.
Me: "Tell me more"
AI: "A recent UN study says, the planet needs to grow 70% more food in the next 40 years. Experts from 8 investment companies predict growth for this category of assets."
Me: "Thanks for reminding me who I am"
...
Moments later.
AI: "This shampoo is made by Unilever, which is implicated in deforestation in Indonesia according to reporting by World Forest Watch. Would you consider buying another brand instead? They have a higher ESG rating."

## Research Objective
My interest lies in understanding how AI assistants can help conscious consumers become sustainable investors. Thus, the purpose of this study is to explore how to provide the best user experience to potential sustainable financial AI companion users, defined as living in Sweden and Taiwan, in the age range between 18 and 35, by employing interviews with experts in finance and design, and a user survey with potential users, including a choice experiment between potential feature sets in consumption, savings, and investment.

## Research Questions
My research aims to explore the following 3 research questions.

| № | Question  | Methods |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | What factors increase potential users choosingsustainable investing?  |  Literature review + Expert Interviews  |
| 2 | What class of investment vehicles do potential usersshow the most interest in?  | Survey  |
| 3 | What application features do potential users rate as thehighest priority?  |  Survey + Prototype Testing with Focus Group  |
