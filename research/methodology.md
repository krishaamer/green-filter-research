# Methodology {#methodology}

-   Start with survey, then expert interviews (because so many questions
    from literature review)

## Factorial Surveys {#factorial-surveys}

-   @li2022assessing: “Factorial surveys is a research method that
    combines classical experiments with survey methodologies. Factorial
    surveys use short narratives, called vignettes, to represent various
    levels of independent variables that are too complex or unethical to
    create and manipulate in real-world or lab situations”
-   Currently CO2 footprint calculators ask you a couple of questions
    and give a ballpark estimate. Does it make sense to track
    sustainability on a more nuanced level, like Apple Health, in order
    to encourage sustainable behavior?

    the world would be a better place

    sustainability has a meaningful impact on sustainability q: it’s

-   Targeted experts (fintech, design, eco activists):

-   Wise founders

-   Monese founders

-   Crypto founders

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[0] }} />

-   What are my hypotheses?

-   User experiments

-   Financial statistics

-   Analyzing existing apps and user pain-points

-   Financial companies

-   Wise

-   Funderbeam

-   Calastone (has an office in Taipei)

-   List of topics gleaned from literature review for discussion with
    the experts:

-   1\. Transparency and sources of ESG and similar data

-   I will test the prototype with potential users using an online
    choice experiment survey.

-   Research Process In terms of literature review, academic inquiry in
    social sciences largely follows phenomena, while the issues and
    technologies discussed here are emergent. Not many studies exist yet
    (they might in a few years), which is why some of my references are
    to company press releases and news stories, or for public companies,
    their advisory for investors.

-   Target potential retail investors aged 20-29, all genders, in
    countries with highly developed financial markets and active social
    campaigns demanding sustainability (Sweden). And Taiwan. In general,
    the Taiwanese culture is savings oriented: I’m in a good location
    for financial user experience research.

-   Set your target goals

-   Access to health care

-   Access to education

-   Climate action

## Research Design {#research-design}

**The research design of this study consists of 3 steps.**

-   Qualitative research targeted at financial and interaction design
    experts, leading to a *wish list* of features.
-   Survey potential users’ preferences, including a choice experiment
    of the proposed features.
-   Design a prototype of the personal sustainable finance AI assistant,
    tested using qualitative methods in a focus group.
-   This mixed-method research design is divided into three stages
    (fig. 11).
-   My purpose for the first qualitative stage is to explore the general
    themes arising from the literature review related to the design of
    AI advisors for investing. I will identify specific user experience
    factors, through interviewing experts in financial technology and
    user experience design and reviewing existing applications on the
    marketplace. At this stage in the research, the central concept
    being studied is defined generally as expectations towards a
    sustainable investment AI advisor.
-   I will then proceed to the second, quantitative stage, informed by
    the previously identified factors, and prepare a survey, including a
    Likert scale, and a choice experiment, focusing on the preferences
    of the potential users aged 18-35, living in Sweden and Taiwan (see
    fig. 12 on next page), exploring the relationship between
    independent variables: - “Interest in Sustainability” - “Interest in
    Investing” - “Preferred Features” - and the dependent variable “User
    Sign-ups”.
-   In the third stage, I will return to the qualitative methods, by
    building a prototype of the sustainable investing AI companion,
    taking into account insights gathered in the previous stage. I will
    use a focus group to discuss the prototype, and conduct a thematic
    analysis of the discussions’ recordings, leading to further
    validation of previously gathered data and possible changes in the
    prototype. The gained insights, accompanied by the app prototype,
    which embodies my findings, will be the final outcome of my
    research.

## Conceptual Framework {#conceptual-framework}

-   The conceptual framework map (fig. 13) presents the key concepts
    arising from the literature review thus far in the research process.
    I’m using these concepts when developing interview strategies for
    phase one of the research, developing the survey questionnaire for
    phase two, as well as for building the Personal Sustainable AI
    Financial Advisor (PSAA) for young adults at the final stage of the
    process. However, I expect the conceptual framework to further
    evolve with additional findings while conducting my research.

## Research Methods {#research-methods}

### Phase One - Qualitative Research {#phase-one---qualitative-research}

The qualitative research methods employed in the first stage of the
research design enables me to explore concepts arising for literature
review further, using a more open approach, without limiting the
conversation only to pre-ascribed notions. The strength of the
qualitative approach in the first stage is to encourage the discovery of
new ideas, not yet common in literature and potential user experience
factors related to sustainable investing and user experience.

#### Sampling {#sampling}

My qualitative sampling structure uses non-probability snowball
sampling, with the following criteria: financial industry, fintech, and
design experts everywhere, including in Taiwan and Sweden, but also
Estonia, Portugal, and elsewhere.

**Method:** Semi-Structured Interviews

I will conduct exploratory research in English using semi-structured
interviews recorded online and offline.

### Phase Two - Quantitative Research {#phase-two---quantitative-research}

The strength of quantitative research is to enable me to access a larger
sample of potential users in two countries, using online survey methods,
and to validate some of the qualitative findings from stage one.

**Sampling** My quantitative sampling structure uses a judgmental
criterion: age 18-35, located in Sweden or Taiwan, surveyed using an
English-language online survey.

**Method:** Likert The survey includes a Likert scale between 1 to 7 to
validate key findings from the first stage of the research by assessing
responses to statements regarding the app’s design, features, and other
criteria that may still emerge.

**Method:** Choice Experiment The survey includes a choice experiment
between different sets of potential features available when
communicating with the sustainable finance AI companion.

### Phase Three - Qualitative Research {#phase-three---qualitative-research}

In the last phase, I will return to the qualitative methods to further
validate the quantitative findings from stage two. Here my focus will be
on operationalizing the gathered insights into a prototype that users
can experiment with and discuss with their peers in a focus group
setting. Sampling

The phase three sampling structure uses a judgmental criterion: - age
18-35 - located in Taiwan - Using the English language for discussion

A focus group of 6 to 10 people will be gathered in Tainan. Because
in-person presence is required in this stage, the prototype will only be
tested by potential users physically present in Taiwan. To avoid
convenience sampling, I will post online ads in English to invite people
who I don’t know personally, to participate in a “financial AI
application testing group” (wording may change).

**Method:** Focus Group The strength of a focus group is the ability to
observe potential users in a social setting, where knowledge can be
exchanged between the participants. The whole experience, including
emerging conversations, will be recorded and transcribed.

**Method:** Thematic Analysis Finally, I will perform a thematic
analysis of the focus group transcriptions in order to validate previous
findings, and open avenues for future research.
