\subsection{The Journey from Consumer to Investor: Designing a Financial
AI Companion for Young Adults to Help With Sustainable Shopping, Saving,
and
Investing}\label{the-journey-from-consumer-to-investor-designing-a-financial-ai-companion-for-young-adults-to-help-with-sustainable-shopping-saving-and-investing}

College students are concerned with the environment, yet they are busy
with school and hindered by unavailability of simple tools to affect
systemic change. Stronger environmental policy from the European Union
includes the concept of \textbf{\emph{digital product passports}}, which
holds the promise to help distinguish \textbf{\emph{eco-designed}}
products made by \textbf{\emph{circular economy}} companies trying to be
zero-waste from companies that simply say they are. Tracking product
data from the source materials until the consumer, combined with
\textbf{\emph{data-driven interaction design}} facilitates building
transparency into opaque systems. Likewise, advances in the development
of \textbf{\emph{large-language models}} enables
\textbf{\emph{artificial intelligence assistants}} to become a
translation layer between complex environmental data and
human-comprehensible language.

The emerging field of \textbf{\emph{Planetary Health}} recognizes
profound interconnections between our economic behaviors, ecosystem
services such as clean water, air, soil, the climate crisis, and human
health. As of 2024, Earth's natural environment is being heavily
degraded by the extractive business practices of companies that make
many of the products and services we buy every day. The way we use our
money to interact with companies - through shopping as consumers and
saving / investing as investors - has an effect on the life-supporting
biosphere we rely on to keep our planet inhabitable. In essence, from an
ecological perspective, every financial action is either an investment
decision to support more environmentally-friendly companies - or to
support polluters.

My research addresses the need for tools to make sustainable financial
action convenient for college students. I focus on leveraging
\textbf{\emph{design research}} to find design concepts for
\textbf{\emph{simple AI user interfaces}} also known as
\textbf{\emph{generative UI}} to help college students participate in
\textbf{\emph{sustainable financial activism}}. A survey of 700 students
across 10 universities in Taiwan was conducted, enhanced by 5 expert
interviews providing industry insights. The major contribution of the
study is an interactive AI-assistant prototype.

Keywords: Climate Anxiety, Human-AI Interaction, Digital Sustainability,
Financial Activism, Transparency, Planetary Health

\subsection{從消費者到投資者的旅程：為年輕成人設計一個財務AI夥伴，幫助他們進行可持續購物、儲蓄和投資}\label{ux5f9eux6d88ux8cbbux8005ux5230ux6295ux8cc7ux8005ux7684ux65c5ux7a0bux70baux5e74ux8f15ux6210ux4ebaux8a2dux8a08ux4e00ux500bux8ca1ux52d9aiux5925ux4f34ux5e6bux52a9ux4ed6ux5011ux9032ux884cux53efux6301ux7e8cux8cfcux7269ux5132ux84c4ux548cux6295ux8cc7}

大學生關注環境問題，但因學業繁忙及缺乏簡便工具來影響體制改變而受阻。歐盟更強化環保政策，引入了「數位產品護照」的概念，此舉有望幫助區分由循環經濟公司製造的、努力實現零廢棄的「生態設計」產品，與僅聲稱自己環保的公司。從原材料到消費者的產品數據追踪，結合「數據驅動的互動設計」，有助於為不透明系統建立透明度。同樣地，「大型語言模型」的發展使得「人工智能助理」能夠成為複雜環境數據與人類可理解語言之間的翻譯層。

新興的「地球健康」領域認識到我們的經濟行為、生態系統服務（如淨水、空氣、土壤）、氣候危機與人類健康之間存在深刻的相互聯繫。截至2024年，地球的自然環境正被開採性企業的商業行為嚴重破壞，這些企業生產我們每天購買的許多產品和服務。我們通過消費和儲蓄/投資與公司的互動方式，對我們賴以生存的、支持地球可居住生物圈產生影響。從生態學的角度看，每一個財務行動都是支持更環保公司的投資決策，或是支持污染者。

我的研究應對了為大學生提供便於實行可持續財務行動的工具需求。我專注於利用「設計研究」來尋找「簡易AI用戶介面」的設計概念，也稱為「生成UI」，以幫助大學生參與「可持續財務行動主義」。在台灣10所大學進行了一項涵蓋700名學生的調查，並增加了5位專家訪談以提供行業見解。研究的主要貢獻是一個互動AI助理原型。

關鍵詞：氣候焦慮、人工智能互動、數位可持續性、財務行動主義、透明度、地球健康。

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

How can people build closer relationships with sustainability-focused
companies? A research project for designing a sustainable shopping,
saving, and investing companion.

\subsection{Research Relevance}\label{research-relevance}

If used wisely, money can help build communities of sustainable impact.
This research is timely in 2023 because of the convergence of five
trends:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}

\end{longtable}

\subsection{Research Background}\label{research-background}

I grew up reading science fiction books and their influence on my
outlook towards future possibilities continues until present day. Star
Trek has a portable device called a \textbf{\emph{tricorder}} (fig.~1),
which enables imaginary future humans fix all kinds of problems from
scanning for minerals inside a cave to scanning human bodies for medical
information. I would love to have such a device for consumer choices and
financial decisions - to know what to buy and which businesses to do
business with. Robots are already integral part of our lives; this
thesis proposal was partially written using Google's and Apple's Voice
recognition software, allowing me to transcribe notes with the help of
an AI assistant.

\end{figure}%

\subsection{Research Motivation}\label{research-motivation}

As a foreigner living in Taiwan, I've relied extensively on AI
assistants for many aspects of my life: to communicate, move around
efficiently, find food and services. Even when we don't realize it, AI
assistants helping us with many of our mundane tasks. When writing in
Chinese, Apple's text prediction algorithms translate pinyin to 漢字 and
show the most likely character based on my previous writing, Google's
maps find efficient and eco-friendly routes and recommend places to eat
and ChatGPT provides statistically probable advice from the sum of human
knowledge. While it takes incredibly complex computational algorithms to
achieve all this in the background, it's become so commonplace, we don't
even think about it. From this point of view, another AI assistant to
help humans with choosing more eco-friendly businesses to show, save,
and invest doesn't sound so much of a stretch.

\subsection{Research Objective}\label{research-objective}

Without reliable and easily accessible data, it seems impossible to know
which company is more sustainable than the other. We don't really know
what's green, unless we spend a lot of time looking at the numbers.
Environmental issues are caused by production and manufacturing
processes of the companies that make the products we consume on a daily
basis. The study presents an AI companion design which seeks to help
people build relationships with sustainability-focused companies. The
major contribution of this study is an interactive artefact (a
prototype) informed by design research.

\subsection{Sources and Literature
Map}\label{sources-and-literature-map}

Given the goal of designing an app to integrate shopping, saving, and
investing sustainably, the literature is quite broad. The literature
review maps out relationships between sustainability and AI interaction
design. The reviewed content consists of 3 main sources:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Scientific papers (largely from ScienceDirect) related to:
\item
  Sustainability, ecology, ecosystem services
\item
  Sustaimable investing, savings, circular economy
\item
  UX/UI, service design, sustainable design, speculative design,
  interaction design
\item
  Generation-Z demographics, behavior change, nudge
\item
  Review of Mobile apps (Apple iOS / Google Android) and web app related
  to:
\item
  Sustainable shopping apps, savings, and investing
\item
  Apps using algorithmic interfaces (AI-based UI)
\item
  EU legislation
\end{itemize}

In order to keep track more easily, each literature review section
includes \textbf{design implications} in context.

The goal of the literature review is to find ideas of app features.

\subsection{Student Protests Around the
World}\label{student-protests-around-the-world}

In August 2018, Swedish high-school student Greta Thunberg skipped class
to start a climate strike in front of the Swedish parliament Riksdag.
Millions of people around the world joined her \emph{Fridays for Future}
protests. Time magazine named Thunberg person of the year for
\emph{creating a global attitudinal shift}
\citep{deutschewelleFridaysFutureGlobal2019}.

\subsection{College Students in
Taiwan}\label{college-students-in-taiwan}

\citep{changExploringDialogicEducation2023} argues Taiwanese culture is
influenced by Confucianism and Daoism, which affect education to be
\textbf{\emph{teacher-centered}}, where traditionally the role of
students is to listen and absorb knowledge; there are open opportunities
to revisit \textbf{\emph{dialogue-based}} education, where students
would be encouraged to take a more active role and gain ownership of
their education.

Taiwan has an aging population
\citep{gohLongrunMacroeconomicConsequences2023}.

\subsection{Online Shopping}\label{online-shopping}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \citet{momovscoupang2024} predicts Momo and Coupang will compete for
  Taiwanese market leadership.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Teachers}\label{teachers}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Elementary-school teachers in Taichung (n=536), have positive
  attitudes towards environmental education are positive, proactive and
  demonstrate high awareness; they have participated in many
  sustainability-related workshops
  \citep{liaoElementaryTeachersEnvironmental2022}. Taiwanese government
  launched the Sustainable Council in 1997 to promote of environmental
  and sustainable development; a survey of university-level teachers
  (n=100) in central Taiwan (Taichung, Changhua, and Yunlin) shows a
  positive attitude toward environmental sustainability among teachers
  however implementation of environmental sustainability practices is
  from low to medium range \citep{FenXi2015}.
\end{itemize}

\item
  The devastating nuclear disaster in Fukushima, Japan, after 2011
  earthquake, had an effect on Taiwanese energy and sustainability
  education \citep{TiChuTan2011}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Students}\label{students}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \citep{GuoZhongXueShengWeiLi2003} reports \emph{good knowledge of
  sustainable development} topics among \textbf{junior high school
  students} in Da-an District, Taipei City (n=596).
  \citep{GaoZhongXueShengWeiLi2009} similarly reports a positive
  attitude and good knowledge of environmental sustainable development
  among senior \textbf{high school students} towards in Taipei City
  (n=328). \citep{chenMarineEnvironmentalAwareness2016} reports a
  \textbf{\emph{positive attitude yet moderate knowledge}} about
  \emph{ocean sustainability} among Taiwanese \textbf{college students}
  (n=825).
\item
  \citep{liuDigitalCapabilityDigital2023} studied sustainability
  behavior of Taiwanese University students reporting the COVID-19
  pandemic also brought more attention on environmental topics .
\item
  When it comes to learning about environmental issues at the
  pre-university level, Taiwanese government has been promoting green
  schools through a green school network; however surveys at middle
  school and high school level suggest there is no impact on
  \emph{sustainability consciousness} among students in comparison with
  regular schools \citep{olssonGreenSchoolsTaiwan2019}. Rather,
  Taiwanese students are influenced towards environmental action by
  \emph{group consciousness}
  \citep{yuUnderstandingTaiwaneseUndergraduate2017}.
\item
  I was unable to find similar research on university and post-graduate
  level students in Taiwan.
\item
  Taiwanese college students and SDGs
  \citep{hoImportancePerformanceSDGs2022}.
\item
  College students in tourism and related fields . and sustainability
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Global Data}\label{global-data}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \citep{manchandaCultivatingSustainabilityConsciousness2023} survey
  (n=726) administered at shopping malls in New Delhi, India, found
  similar levels of sustainability consciousness between Millenial
  (n=206) and Generation-Z (n=360) age groups; people with high level of
  materialism were found to be less sustainability-conscious; the effect
  of mindfulness on sustainability was found to be stronger among
  females than males, supporting the hypothesis of the moderating effect
  of gender.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{There's evidence young people have money.} In the United States,
the combined annual consumer spending of generation-z and millennials
was over 2.5 Trillion USD in 2020 \citep{ypulseMillennialsGenTeens2020}.
Over the decade from 2020 to 2030, in the U.S., UK, and Australia,
Millennials are projected to inherit 30 trillion USD from their parents
\citep{calastoneMillennialsInvestingDetailed2020}. There's also some
evidence of investment interest, however there's large geographic
variance. According to a
\citep{calastoneMillennialsInvestingDetailed2020} study (n=3000)
surveying people in the millennial age group between ages 23 and 35 in
Europe (UK, France, Germany), U.S.A., Hong Kong, and Australia, 48\% of
respondents located in Hong Kong owned financial securities (such as
stocks) while the figure was just 10\% in France.

\subsubsection{Sustainability Tools in the Taiwanese
Context}\label{sustainability-tools-in-the-taiwanese-context}

Musical garbage truck are a success story of the environmental progress
in Taiwan \citep{helendavidsonClassicalTrashHow2022}. Indeed, they are a
\emph{user interface innovation} and the main way how people in Taiwan
interact with sustainability issues.

The popular narrative about Taiwan recounts the story of the economic
and environmental transformation of the country. In the late 1980s
during the heights of an economic boom Taiwan became famous as the
Taiwanese Miracle (臺灣奇蹟)
\citep{goldStateSocietyTaiwan1986, tsaiExplainingTaiwanEconomic1999}. By
the early 1990s another less flattering nickname appeared: ``garbage
island'', for the piles of trash covering the streets and overflowing
landfills
\citep{rapidtransitionsallianceTaiwanTransitionGarbage2019, ngoHowGettingRid2020}.
In the two decades that followed, from 1998 to 2018, Taiwan made
progress in municipal waste management, rising to the status of a
world-leader in recycling (2nd \emph{effective recycling rate} after
Germany); in addition to an effective recycling system, the average
waste amount generated per person by 700g (from 1140g to 400g) per day;
nonetheless, industrial recycling rates were less stellar, standing at
80\% in 2020 and there were unrealized opportunities in using industry
4.0 technologies, such as internet of things (IoT) sensors for better
waste tracking
\citep{wuSupportingCircularEconomy2021, buiMunicipalSolidWaste2023}.

Progress in sustainability is possible but achieving results takes time
and innovation.
\citep{rapidtransitionsallianceTaiwanTransitionGarbage2019} credits the
Taiwanese Homemakers United Foundation (財團法人主婦聯盟環境保護基金會)

\subsubsection{Developing Personas}\label{developing-personas}

User research makes extensive use of user \emph{personas} to represent a
group of people with similar attributes. Designers use personas to
\emph{articulate assumptions,} which, if used well, is useful for
\emph{user-centered design}, to create better products. Personas help to
reflect on what kind of \emph{biases} might exist in the design. Within
the larger cohort of college students several different personas could
be defined, for example grouping people by interests, knowledge, habits,
levels of anxiety, and other attributes.

Humans have a long list of cognitive biases, which a good design should
take into account.

There is extensive research on the attitudes of U.S. college students
towards climate change. \citep{americanpressinstituteKnowingNewsHow2022}
reports only 37\% percent of U.S. Generation-Z and Millenials follow
news related to environmental issues.
\citep{schwartzClimateChangeAnxiety2022} reports some adult US students
in a small study (18-35, n = 284) express feelings of insignificance of
their actions to achieve any meaningful impact.
\citep{thomaesGreenTeensUnderstanding2023} reports U.S. adolescents
don't find sustainability relevant to their daily life.
\citep{rossClimateChangeChallenge2016} says most people in the U.S.
don't act on climate change. ``Action on climate change has been
compromised by uncertainty, aspects of human psychology''.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Students in the Generation-Z age bracket (abbreviated as Gen-Z or
  Zoomers) are born between 1997 and 2012
  \citep{brankavuletaGenerationStatistics2023}. Over 98\% of Gen-Z owns
  a smartphone while only 80\% of the general world population does
  \citep{globalwebindex98GenOwn2017, bankmycellHowManyPeople2022}.
\item
  High levels of technology adoption worldwide
\item
  \citep{creditsuisseYoungConsumersMay2022} suggests young consumers are
  more eco-friendly and drive the speed of change. Yet the Economist has
  ran a few anonymous articles calling gen-z green ideals into question
  \citep{theeconomistHowSellYoung2023, HowGenMillennials2023}.
\item
  \citet{deyangeorgiev39SmartphoneStatistics2023}
\item
  \citet{alexreiceMostEcoconsciousGeneration2021}
\end{itemize}

The above studies give foundation for creating a persona of a U.S.
College Student who doesn't follow environmental news and thinks climate
action doesn't make a difference. This doesn't necessarily mean this
group of people with similar ideas would deny climate change is
happening. Rather ``Climate Denier'' could be another persona, grouping
people into a cohort who thinks climate change is not real. Further
research would be needed to define relevant personas which have
meaningful predictive and generalizing power.

A large worldwide study (n=10000, age 16-25) by
\citep{hickmanClimateAnxietyChildren2021} provides evidence the youth is
anxious about climate in Australia, Brazil, Finland, France, India,
Nigeria, Philippines, Portugal, the UK, and the USA. Similarly,
\citep{thompsonYoungPeopleClimate2021} finds young people around the
world have climate anxiety. \citep{whitmarshClimateAnxietyWhat2022}
shows worry about the climate in the UK is generally widespread (over
40\% of the respondents, n=1332), while climate anxiety is highest among
young people and is a possible motivator for climate action.
Additionally, \citep{ogunbodeClimateAnxietyWellbeing2022} finds climate
anxiety in 32 countries and also supports the idea that climate anxiety
leads to climate activism. \citep{thibodeauThreeCompaniesClosing2022}:
``In 2021, the BBC polled 1,000 people in Scotland to understand the
barriers to taking climate action. What they found was even though many
people were aware of actions needed to take to address climate change,
and had intentions to their behaviors didn't change. This is a
phenomenon called the intention-action gap.''

\subsection{Evolving Sustainability Measurments from Planetary
Boundaries to Planetary
Health}\label{evolving-sustainability-measurments-from-planetary-boundaries-to-planetary-health}

\emph{Sustainability} was first mentioned in the seminal book
\emph{Sylvicultura oeconomica} in the context of forestry with the goal
of achieving sustainable forest management
\citep{hannsscarlvoncarlowitzSylviculturaOeconomicaOder1713}. The field
is known today as \emph{sustainable yield} of \emph{natural capital}
with a focus on maintaining \emph{ecosystem services}
\citep{peterkareivaNaturalCapitalTheory2011}. Aldo Leopold proposed the
idea of \emph{land ethics} as \emph{``{[}a{]} thing is right when it
tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic
community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise''} in his landmark work
\emph{A Sand County Almanac} \citep{leopoldSandCountyAlmanac1972}. The
1987 United Nations' Brundtland Report (Our Common Future) defined
sustainable development as \emph{``Development that meets the needs of
the present without compromising the ability of future generations to
meet their own needs''}
\citep{worldcommissiononenvironmentanddevelopmentOurCommonFuture1987}.

In 1896, the Nobel Prize winner Svante Arrhenius first calculated how an
increase in CO\textsubscript{2} levels could have a warming effect on
our global climate
\citep{andersonCO2GreenhouseEffect2016, wulffPetterLegacy2020}. 120
years later, the Paris Climate Agreement came into effect, with
countries agreeing on non-binding targets on how to keep
CO\textsubscript{2} levels 1.5 °C below pre-industrial levels
\citep{unitednationsParisAgreement2016}. While awareness of Earth's
warming climate was growing, the CO\textsubscript{2} emissions kept
rising too. The hockey-stick growth of CO\textsubscript{2} concentration
since the industrial revolution is clear in the data from 1958 onward,
following a steady annual increase, called the \emph{Keeling Curve}
\citep{keelingAtmosphericMonthlySitu2017}. Written records of global
temperature measurements are available starting from the 1880s when
documentation of temperatures become available in ship records
\citep{BrohanClimate2012}. Temperature estimations from tree-trunks
allow some temperature comparisons with the climate as far back as 2000
years ago \citep{rubinoLawDomeIce2019}.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{./images/co2-concentration.png}

}

\caption{CO\textsubscript{2} concentration in the atmosphere as of Ap.

\end{figure}%

In 1938, Guy Stewart Callendar was the first to demonstrate the warming
of Earth's land surface as well as linking the production of fossil
fuels to increased CO\textsubscript{2} and changing climate
\citep{hawkinsIncreasingGlobalTemperatures2013}. By the latest data from
2022, the current world population of 8 Billion people emitted 37.5
gigatonnes of CO\textsubscript{2} per year, the highest emissions
recorded in history \citep{statistaAnnualCO2Emissions2023}. To limit
global warming to 1.5 °C as agreed by the world nations in Paris,
removal of 5-20 gigatons of CO\textsubscript{2} per year would be needed
according to reduction pathways calculated by the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \citep{wadeMoisturedrivenCO2Pump2023}.
Yet, most countries are missing the mark. Given this model of climate
change, the G7 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United
Kingdom, United States) are heading for 2.7 °C of warming by 2050
\citep{cdpMissingMarkCDP2022}. The monumental task of removing several
gigatons of CO\textsubscript{2} from the atmosphere requires massive
policy shifts and collaboration across countries and industries
\citep{macklerPolicyAgendaGigatonscale2021}.

News reports saying quoting the ``The European Union's Copernicus
Climate Change Service (C3S)'' 1.5 has already been breached
\citep{WorldFirstYearlong2024, FirstTimeWorld2024}.

In 1948, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) was
founded, which in

LULUCF ``Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry'' can be a source of
greenhouse gas emissions or a carbon sink (removing CO2 from the
atmosphere)

In addition the enormity of emissions, humanity is facing other massive
problems. The Stockholm Resilience Centre reports we have already
breached 4 out of our 9 planetary boundaries: in addition to climate
change, biodiversity loss (Extinctions per Million Species per Year aka
E/MSY), land-system change (deforestation, land degradation, etc), and
biogeochemical flows (cycles of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, etc); on a
positive side, the challenges of fresh water use, ocean acidification
and stratospheric ozone depletion are still within planetary limits
\citep{perssonOutsideSafeOperating2022}.

\paragraph{Climate Data Vizualisation}\label{climate-data-vizualisation}

Climate data visualization has a long history, starting with
\textbf{\emph{Alexander von Humboldt,}} the founder of climatology, who
revolutionized cartography by inventing the first \emph{isothermal maps}
around the year 1816; these maps showed areas with similar temperature,
variations in altitude and seasons in different colors
\citep{hontonForgottenFatherClimatology2022}. Humboldt's isotherms are
now available as 3D computer models in \citep{IsothermsSimplyEarth2023}.

Earth's physical systems are very sensitive to small changes in
temperature, which was not understood until 30 years ago

\subsubsection{Climatech}\label{climatech}

How are large corporations responding to the climate crisis?

Lack of leadership. \citet{capgeminiWorldBalanceWhy2022}: ``Many
business leaders see sustainability as costly obligation rather than
investment in the future''. \citet{hoikkalaCEOSeesTerrible2019}: for
example the CEO of the Swedish clothing producer H\&M, one of the
largest fast-fashion in the world, recognizes the potential impact of
conscious consumers as a threat.

Many large businesses have tried to find solutions by launching
climate-focused funding. \citep{korosecAmazonTaps2B2021} reports that
Amazon's 2B USD to a Climate Pledge Fund earmarked to fix climate
problems is invested in energy, logistics, and packaging startups, which
will reduce material waste. ``Good intentions don't work, mechanisms
do,'' Amazon's founder Bezos is quoted as saying in
\citep{cliffordHowThisPopular2022}. Walmart is taking a similar
approach, having launched a project in 2017 to set CO\textsubscript{2}
reduction targets in collaboration with its suppliers
\citet{walmartProjectGigaton2023}. These examples underlines how money
marketed as climate funding by retail conglomerates means focus on
reducing operational cost of running their business through automation
and material savings.

Large corporations such as Nestle and Coca Cola support the biodiversity
law to have a level playing field for business
\citep{greensefaNatureVoteSuccess2023}.

  Environmental Quality --~In order to have healthy communities, we need
  clean air, natural resources, and a nontoxic environment.''

  \citet{lowRethinkingNetZeroSystems2022} finds considerable uncertainty
  exists among experts which CO2 reduction methods among nature-based
  and technology-based are the most effective.
\item

\subsubsection{Ecosystem Services Enable Life on
Earth}\label{ecosystem-services-enable-life-on-earth}

\citet{historyEcosystemServices2010} the history of the valuation of
nature's services goes back to the 18th century when David Ricardo and
Jean Baptiste Say discussed nature's \emph{work}, however both
considered it should be free. In 1997
\citet{dailyNatureServicesSocietal1997} proposed the idea of ecosystem
services and \citet{costanzaValueWorldEcosystem1997} attempted to assess
the amount of ecosystem services provided.

\citet{leprovostSupplyMultipleEcosystem2022} study shows
\emph{biodiversity} as one key factor to maintain delivery of ecosystem
services. \citet{noriegaResearchTrendsEcosystem2018} attempts to

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Environmental Degradation Is
Cir}}{Environmental Degradation Is Cir}}\label{environmental-degradation-is-cir}

\paragraph{Growing Population and
Overpopulation}\label{growing-population-and-overpopulation}

Earth's population reached 8 Billion people In November 2022 and
population projections by predict 8.5B people by 2030 and 9.7B by 2050
\citep{theeconomictimesClimateChangeEarth2022, unWorldPopulationProspects2022}.

\citep{hassounFoodProcessingCurrent2023} forecasts increase of global
food demand by 62\% including impact of climate change.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  While population growth puts higher pressure on Earth's resources,
  some research proposes the effect is more from wasteful lifestyles
  than the raw number of people
  \citep{cardinaleBiodiversityLossIts2012}.
\item
  \citet{bowlerMappingHumanPressures2020} Anthropogenic Threat Complexes
  (ATCs):
\item
  ``Overpopulation is a major cause of biodiversity loss and smaller
  human populations are necessary to preserve what is left''
  \citet{cafaroOverpopulationMajorCause2022}.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Marine Heatwaves}\label{marine-heatwaves}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \citep[ and
  \citet{gellesOceanDireMessage2023}]{smaleMarineHeatwavesThreaten2019}
  describe how marine heatwaves threaten global biodiversity.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Slavery Still Exists}\label{slavery-still-exists}

In 2023, an estimated 50 million people are still in slavery around the
world; lack of supply chain visibility hides forced labor and
exploitation of undocumented migrants in agricultural work; 71\% of
enslaved people are estimated to be women.
\citep{kunzAdoptionTransferabilityJoint2023, borrelliCareSupportMaternity2023}.

The UN SDG target 8.7 targets to eliminate all forms of slavery.

Slavery is connected to environmental degradation and climate change
\citep{deckersparksGrowingEvidenceInterconnections2021}. Enslaved people
are used in environmental crimes such as 40\% of deforestation globally.
Cobalt used in technological products is in risk of being produced under
forced labor in the D.R. Congo
\citep{sovacoolWhenSubterraneanSlavery2021}. In India and Pakistan,
forced labor in brick kiln farms is possible to capture remotely from
satellite images \citep{boydSlaverySpaceDemonstrating2018}. In effect,
the need for cheap labor turns slavery into a \emph{subsidy} keeping
environmental degradation happening.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \citet{christBlockchainTechnologyModern2021} estimates 20 million
  people are stuck inside corporate blockchains. The Global Slavery
  Index measures the \textbf{\emph{Import Risk}} of having slavery
  inside its imports \citet{walkfreeGlobalSlaveryIndex2023}.
\item
  \citet{hansvanleeuwenModernSlaveryGrace2023} slavery affects
  industries from fashion to technology, including sustainability
  enablers such as solar panels.
\item
  ``commodification of human beings''
\item
  \citet{anandchandrasekharWhySwitzerlandMatters2021}: Trading
  commodities ``Switzerland has a hand in over 50\% of the global trade
  in coffee and vegetable oils like palm oil as well as 35\% of the
  global volume of cocoa, according to government estimates.'' Can
  traders have more scrutiny over what they trade?
\item
  Modern Slavery Act.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Overconsumption Drive Climate
Change}\label{overconsumption-drive-climate-change}

Overconsumption is one of the main drivers of climate change.'' Around
2/3 of global GHG emissions are directly and indirectly linked to
household consumption, with a global average of about 6 tonnes
CO\textsubscript{2} equivalent per capita.''
\citep{reneechoHowBuyingStuff2020, ivanovaQuantifyingPotentialClimate2020}

Overconsumption is also one of the root causes of plastic pollution.
\citet{FORD2022150392} and \citet{laversFarDistractionPlastic2022} find
strong linkage of climate change and marine plastic pollution ``along
with other stressors that threaten the resilience of species and
habitats sensitive to both climate change and plastic pollution''.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \citet{laversFarDistractionPlastic2022} plastic pollution is pervasive
  around the Earth and is fundamentally linked to climate change
\end{itemize}

While the number on overconsumption are clear, the debate on
overconsumption is so polarized, it's difficult to have a meaningful
discussion of the topic
\citep{ianoleOverconsumptionSocietyLookingglass2013}.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Overconsumption and underinvestment.
\item
  Cities are responsible for 80\% of the emissions
  \citet{rosalescarreonUrbanEnergySystems2018}
\item
  \citet{mobergMobilityFoodHousing2019} reports daily human activities
  emission contribution on average in four European countries (France,
  Germany, Norway and Sweden).

\subsubsection{Biodiversity is Decreasing
Rapidly}\label{biodiversity-is-decreasing-rapidly}

\citet{livingPlanetReport2022} reported, the number of species killed,
mass destruction of nature. ``69\% decline in the relative abundance of
monitored wildlife populations around the world between 1970 and 2018.
Latin America shows the greatest regional decline in average population
abundance (94\%), while freshwater species populations have seen the
greatest overall global decline (83\%).''

Biodiversity loss is linked to overconsumption, weak legislation and
lack of oversight. \citep{crennaBiodiversityImpactsDue2019} recounts
European Union consumers' negative impact on biodiversity in countries
where it imports food. \citet{wwfForestsReducingEU2022} case study
highlights how 4 biodiverse regions Cerrado in Brazil, Chaco in
Argentina, Sumatra in Indonesia, and the Cuvette Centrale in Democratic
Republic of Congo are experiencing rapid destruction due to consumer
demand in the European Union. While the European Union (EU) has recently
become a leader in sustainability legislation, biodiversity protection
measures among private companies is very low
\citet{marco-fondevilaTrendsPrivateSector2023}.

Meanwhile, there is some progress in biodiversity conservation.
\citet{uebtBiodiversityBarometer2022} reports ``Biodiversity awareness
is now at 72\% or higher in all countries sampled, compared to only 29\%
or higher across countries sampled in 2009.''

Similarly to climate protection, the UN has taken a leadership role in
biodiversity protection. \citet{unitHistoryConvention2023}: The history
of the United Nations Convention on Biodiversity goes back to 1988, when
the working group was founded. \citet{unepCOP15EndsLandmark2022}: The
Convention on Biodiversity 2022 (COP15) adopted the first global
biodiversity framework to accompany climate goals.

\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{\emph{Biodiversity

Cutting edge research uses AI for listening to nature, assessing
biodiversity based on species' sounds in the forest. Millions of
detections of different species with machine learning passive acoustic
AI models, can also assess species response to climate change
\citep{aiforgoodListeningNatureHarnessing2023, guerreroAcousticAnimalIdentification2023}.

\paragraph{Forest and Deforestion}\label{forest-and-deforestion}

Around 27\% of Earth's land area is still covered by forests yet
deforestation is widespread all around the world; highest rates of
deforestation happened in the tropical rainforests of South America and
Africa, mainly caused by agricultural cropland expansion (50\% of all
deforestation) and grazing land for farm animals to produce meat
(38,5\%), totaling close to 90\% of global deforestation
\citep{FRA2020Remote2022}. Forests are a crucial part of Earth's carbon
cycle and the main natural CO\textsubscript{2} capture system; due to
deforestation, Europe rapidly losing its forest carbon sink
\citep{fredericsimonEuropeRapidlyLosing2022}.

Afforestation is different from reforestation, which takes into account
biodiversity.

Air pollution is widespread around the planet, with 99\% of Earth's
human population being affected by bad air quality that does not meet
WHO air quality guidelines, leading to health problems linked to 6.7
million premature deaths every year
\citet{worldhealthorganizationAmbientOutdoorAir2022}. Grounbreaking
research by \citet{lim1MOAirPollutioninduced2022} analyzed over 400000
individuals in England, South Korea and Taiwan establishes exposure to
2.5μm PM (PM2.5) air pollution as a cause for lung cancer.
\citet{bouscasseDesigningLocalAir2022} finds strong health and economic
benefits across the board from air pollution reduction in France. In
\citet{hannahdevlinCancerBreakthroughWakeup2022}, prof Tony Mok, of the
Chinese University of Hong Kong: ``We have known about the link between
pollution and lung cancer for a long time, and we now have a possible
explanation for it. As consumption of fossil fuels goes hand in hand
with pollution and carbon emissions, we have a strong mandate for
tackling these issues -- for both environmental and health reasons''.

Health and sustainability are inextricably linked. ``Human health is
central to all sustainability efforts.'', ``All of these (food, housing,
power, and health care), and the~stress~that the lack of them generate,
play a huge role in our health''
\citep{sarahludwigrauschSustainabilityYourHealth2021}.

The main way to combat air pollution is through policy interventions.
\citet{marialuisfernandesRealityCheckIndustrial2023} EU has legislation
in progress to curb industrial emissions. If legislation is in place,
causing bad air quality can become bad for business.
\citet{guHiddenCostsNongreen2023} links air pollution to credit interest
rates for business loans in China; companies with low environmetal
awareness and a history of environmental penalties pay 12 percent higher
interest rates.

Clean air is a requirement.

Global warming increases the risk of disasters and extreme weather
events. As extreme temperatures are increasingly commonplace, there's
increased risk of wildfires \citep{volkovaEffectsPrescribedFire2021}.
Summers of 2022 and 2023 were the hottest on record so far, with extreme
heat waves recorded in places around the world

As temperatures rise, certain cities may become uninhabitable for humans
\citep{cbcradioExtremeHeatCould2021}. The summer of 2023 saw extensive
wildfires in Spain, Canada, and elsewhere; rapidly moving fires
destroyed the whole city of Lāhainā in Hawaii {[}ADD CITATION{]}. The

``Global CO\textsubscript{2} emissions from energy combustion and
industrial processes rebounded in 2021 to reach their highest ever
annual level. A 6\% increase from 2020 pushed emissions to 36.3
gigatonnes''. As on June 2023, fossil fuel based energy makes up 82\% of
energy and is still growing \citet{instituteEnergySystemStruggles2023}.
The 425 largest fossil fuel projects represent a total of over 1
gigatons in CO\textsubscript{2} emissions, 40\% of which were new
projects \citet{kuhneCarbonBombsMapping2022}.
\citet{tilstedEndingFossilbasedGrowth2023} expects the fossil fuel

applicable to companies and for organizing emission reduction schemes
\citep{nationalpublicutilitiescouncilAnnualUtilityDecarbonization2022}.
For example, for consumers in Australian states and territories in 2018,
83\% of the GHG emissions are Scope 3, meaning indirect emissions in the
value chain \citet{goodwinTargetingDegreesGlobal2023}.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \citet{vitilloRoleCarbonCapture2022} illustrates how direct air
  capture of CO\textsubscript{2} is difficult because of low

\item
  \citet{gaureTrueNotTrue2022} simulate a CO\textsubscript{2} free
  electricity generation system in the European Union where ``98\% of

Sustainability is filled with complexities, where CO\textsubscript{2}
emission is compounded by biodiversity loss, child labor, slavery,
poverty, prostitution, dangerous chemicals, and many other issues become
intertwined \citep{tedxSustainableBusinessFrank2020}. One attempt to
measure these complexities, is the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) which is
defined as ``additional damage caused by an extra unit of emissions''
\citep{kornekSocialCostCarbon2021, zhenSimpleEstimateSocial2018}. For
example the cost of damages caused by ``one extra ton of carbon dioxide
emissions'' \citep{stanforduniversityProfessorsExplainSocial2021}. SCC
variations exists between countries \citep{tolSocialCostCarbon2019} and
regions \citep{wangMeasurementChinaProvincial2022}.

\subsection{Eco-Design}\label{eco-design}

\textbf{\emph{Designing for Sustainability aka Circular Design or
Eco-Design}} encompasses all human activities, making this pursuit an
over-arching challenge across all industries also known as circular
economy. Assuming that as individuals we want to act in a sustainable
way, how exactly would be go about doing that?

  Sinkevičius, EU Commissioner for the Environment, Oceans and
  Fisheries, is quoted as describing eco-design ``respects the
  boundaries of our planet'' \citet{europeancommissionGreenDealNew2022}

We have an opportunity to re-imagine how every product can be an
eco-product and how they circulate in our circular economy.

Timeline of the Policy Context:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In 2019 by the von der Leyen commission adopted the European Union
  (EU) \textbf{Green Deal} strategy.
\item
  In 2021 the Commision proposed a goal of reducing CO2e emissions by
  55\% by 2030 under the \emph{Fit for 55} policy package consisting of
  a wide range of economic measures.
\item
  In November 2022, the proposal was adopted by the EU Council and EU
  Parliament with an updated goal of 57\% of CO2e reductions compared to
  1990. This proposal is set to become a binding law for all EU member
  countries (\citet{europeancommissionEuropeanGreenDeal2019};
  \citet{europeancommissionSustainableEurope20302019};
  \citet{EUReachesAgreement2022}; \citet{europeancouncilFit55EU2022}).
\item
  In March 2022, the EU Circular Economy Action Plan was adopted,
  looking to make sustainable products \emph{the norm} in EU and
  \emph{empowering consumers} as described in
  \citet{europeancommissionCircularEconomyAction2022}. Each product
  covered by the policy is required to have a \textbf{\emph{Digital
  Product Passport}} which enables improved processing within the supply
  chain and includes detailed information to empower consumers to
  understand the environmental footprint of their purchases. It's safe
  to say the large majority of products available today do not meet
  these criteria.

Politics matters in sustainability.

In the European Union (EU), a wide range of legislative proposals,
targets, organizations, and goals already exists across diverse
countries. Upcoming laws aim to harmonize approaches to sustainability
and raise standards for all members states, in turn influencing
producers who wish to sell in the EU common market.

\begin{itemize}

  In Brazil, deforestation fell 60\% in 1 year, based on remote
  satellite reconnaissance, after the election of a more pro-environment
  leadership \citet{wattsAmazonDeforestationFalls2023}.

\subsubsection{Waste Generation is Still
Increasing}\label{waste-generation-is-still-increasing}

\citet{liuGlobalPerspectiveEwaste2023} reports, e--waste is growing
3\%--5\% every year, globally.
\citep{thukralExploratoryStudyProducer2023} identifies several barriers
to e-waste management among producers including lack of awareness and
infrastructure, attitudinal barriers, existing \emph{informal} e-waste
sector, and the need for an e-waste license.

\subsubsection{Extended Producer Responsibility Enables Compannies to be
Resposible}\label{extended-producer-responsibility-enables-compannies-to-be-resposible}

Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is a policy tool first proposed
by Thomas Lindhqvist in Sweden in 1990 {[}ADD CITATION{]}, aimed to
encourage producers take responsibility for the entire life-cycle of
their products, thus leading to more eco-friendly products. Nonetheless,
EPR schemes do not guarantee circularity and may instead be designed
around fees to finance waste management in linear economy models
\citep{christiansenExtendedProducerResponsibility2021}. The French EPR
scheme was upgraded in 2020 to become more circular
\citep{jacquesvernierExtendedProducerResponsibility2021}.

In any case, strong consumer legislation (such as EPR) has a direct
influence on producers' actions. For example, in
\citet{hktdcresearchFranceExpandsProducer2022}, the Hong Kong Trade
Development Council notified textile producers in July 2022 reminding
factories to produce to French standards in order to be able enter the
EU market. \citet{pengExtendedProducerResponsibility2023} finds that the
\textbf{\emph{Carbon Disclosure Project}} has been a crucial tool to
empower ERP in Chinese auto-producers.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The success of EPR can vary per type of product. For car tires, the
  EPR scheme in the Netherlands claims a 100\% recovery rate

\item
  \citet{steenmansFosteringCircularEconomy2023} Argues for the need to
  engage companies through legislation and shift from waste-centered
  laws to product design regulations.
\item
  In Europe, there's large variance between member states when in comes
  to textile recycling: while Estonia and France are the only EU
  countries where separate collection of textiles is required by law, in
  Estonia 100\% of the textiles were burned in an incinerator in 2018
  while in France textiles are covered by an Extended Producer
  Responsibility (EPR) scheme leading to higher recovery rates (Ibid).

\subsection{Platform Economy Popularises Data-Driven
Design}\label{platform-economy-popularises-data-driven-design}

As we humans go about our daily business, we produce massive amounts of
data, which is useful for designing better products. There are many
approaches to design and the majority share the common goal of designing
for a good user experience.

Designing for high retention (users keep coming back).

\subsubsection{Capturing User Data}\label{capturing-user-data}

Platform economy companies capture large amounts of data from users.

\emph{Network Effects,} the more people use a platform, the more
valuable it becomes.

\textbf{Data is The Interface:} \emph{platform economy} marketplace
companies like Airbnb and Uber match idle resources with retail demand
and optimize how our cities work.

By continuously adding features (and provided consumer legislation
allows it), platforms can evolve into superapps. Superapps are possible
thanks to \textbf{Nudge, Economies of Scale, Network Effects, Behaviour
Design.}

Personalization at scale: the largest businesses today (measured in
number of users) design the whole user experience. Popular consumer
platforms strive to design solutions that feel personalized at every
touchpoint on the user journey (to use the language of service design)
at the scale of hundreds of billions of users.

Superapps are honeypots of data that is used for many types of behavior
modeling. \citep{suarezEnhancingUserIncome2021} suggests using
alternative data from super-apps to estimate user income levels,
including 4 types of data: Personal Information, Consumption Patterns,
Payment Information, and Financial services.
\citep{roaSuperappBehavioralPatterns2021} finds super-app alternative
data is especially useful for credit-scoring young, low-wealth
individuals. The massive amounts of data generated by these companies
are used by smart cities to re-design their physical environments.

  can transform social and financial interactions of an entire country.
  \citep{vecchiTwoTalesInternationalization2022} China is the home of
  many superapps and this paper discusses the strategies taken to expand

\subsection{Data Enables Generative
UIs}\label{data-enables-generative-uis}

In design there are many overlapping terms created by different people
for diverse purposes from distinguishing a particular type of design to
marketing oneself as the creator of the term.

There are many ways to structure design theory but for the purposes of
this AI-focused research, I will begin from Generative UI.

structure: data-driven design, generative UI

AI will decide what kind of UI to show to you based on the data and
context

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Replit, a startup known for allowing user build apps in the web
  browser, released Openv0, a framework of AI-generated UI components
  \citep{replitReplitOpenv0OpenSource2023}. ``Components are the
  foundation upon which user interfaces (UI) are built, and generative
  AI is unlocking component creation for front-end developers,
  transforming a once arduous process, and aiding them in swiftly
  transitioning from idea to working components.''
\item
  Vercel introduced an open-source prototype UI-generator called V0
  which used large language models (LLMs) to create code for web pages
  based on text prompts \citep{vercelIntroducingV0Generative2023}. Other
  similar tools quickly following including Galileo AI, Uizard
  AutoDesigner and Visily \citep{WhoBenefitsMost2024}.
\item
  In 2014, the eminent journal \emph{Information Sciences} decided to
  dedicate a special section to AI-generated software to call attention
  to this tectonic shift in software development
  \citep{reformatSpecialSectionApplications2014}.
\item
  As machines become more capable, machines will eventually be capable
  of producing machines.
\item
  Generative UIs are largely invented in practice, based on user data
  analysis and experimentation, rather than being built in theory. Kelly
  Dern, a Senior Product Designer at Google lead a workshop in early
  2024 on \emph{GenUI for product inclusion} aiming to create
  \textbf{\emph{``\textbf{more accessible and inclusive {[}UIs for{]}
  users of all backgrounds}''.}}
\item
  \citep{GenerativeUIDesign2023} gives an overview of the history of
  generative AI design tools going back in time until 2012 when
  \citep{troianoGeneticAlgorithmsSupporting2014} proposed genetic
  algorithms for UI design.
\item
  \citep{fletcherGenerativeUIDownfall2023} and
  \citep{joeblairGenerativeUINew2024} are worried UIs are becoming
  average; that is more and more similar towards the lowest common
  denominator. We can generate better ones that are based on user data
  and would be truly personalized.
\item
  \citep{nielsenAccessibilityHasFailed2024} recounts how 30 years of
  work towards usability has largely failed - computers are still not
  accessible enough (\textbf{\emph{``difficult, slow, and
  unpleasant''}}) - and has hope Generative UI could offer a chance to
  provide levels of accessibility humans could not.
\item
  \citep{matteosciortinoGenerativeUIHow2024} coins the phrase RTAG UIs
  \emph{``real-time automatically-generated UI interfaces''} mainly
  drawing from the example of how his Netflix interface looks different
  from that of his sisters because of their dissimilar usage patterns.

\citet{mckeoughMcKinseyDesignLaunches2018} business consultancies have
begun to recognize the importance of design to business. They advise
their corporate clients to bring user experience design to the core of
their business operations.

There's a number of user interface design patterns that have provide
successful across a range of social media apps. Such \textbf{\emph{user
experience / user interface}} (UX/UI) patterns are copied from one app
to another, to the extent that the largest apps share a similar look and
feature set. Common UX/UI parts include the Feed and Stories. By using
common UI parts from social media users have an easier time to accept
the innovative parts. add Viz charts. Avatars are increasingly common
and new generations are used to talking to computers.

There are also more philosophical approaches to \textbf{\emph{Interface
Studies:}} \citet{davidhoangCreatingInterfaceStudies2022}, the head of
product design at Webflow, suggests taking cues from art studies to
\textbf{\emph{isolate the core problem}}: \emph{``An art study is any
action done with the intention of learning about the subject you want to
draw''}. As a former art student, Hoang looks at an interface as
\emph{``a piece of design is an artwork with function''}.

Indeed, art can be a way to see new paths forward, practicing
``\emph{fictioning}'' to deal with problematic legacies:
\citet{Review2023Helsinki2023}

\item
  Involving young HCI designers in AI-oriented workshops can show the
  future of UI/UX ? \citep{battistoniCanAIOrientedRequirements2023}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Speculative Design}\label{speculative-design}

Speculative design makes use of future scenarios to envision contexts
and interactions in future use. The term \textbf{\emph{speculative
design}} was invented by \citet{dunneSpeculativeEverythingDesign2013} in
their seminal book to question the intersection of user experience
design and speculative fiction. For example \citet{BARENDREGT2021374}
explores the potential of speculative design to stimulate public
engagement through thought experiments that spur public debate on an
issue chosen by the designer.

Phil Balagtas, founder of The Design Futures Initiative at McKinsey,
discusses the value of building future scenarios at his talk at Google.
One of his examples, the Apple Knowledge Navigator, from an Apple vision
video in 1987, took two decades to materialize in the real world. It was
inspired by a similar device first shown in a 1970s episode of Star Trek
as a \textbf{magic device} (a term from participatory design), which
then inspired subsequent consumer product development. It took another 2
decades, until the launch of the iPhone in 2007 - a total of 40 years.
Imagination is crucial for change
\citep{googledesignDesignSpeculativeFutures2019}.

The cost of speculative design makes it into a niche activity yet
Generative AI holds the promise to allow designers to dream up and
prototype quicker. In order to build a future, it's relevant to imagine
and critique a future.

The same is true for Participatory Design. By being quickly generate
prototypes, once can test out ideas with the future users involving more
of the community and stakeholders.

\subsubsection{Quantified Self}\label{quantified-self}

Example of quantified self device. My personal air pollution exposure
tracked using the Atmotube device attached to my backpack.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Open Source code for calculating air pollution exposure AQI:

\item

  system activity. Brain Music Lab founder and brain researcher Grace
  Leslie: ``brain music sounds like a warm bathtub''.
\item
  Companies like NeuralLink are building devices to build meaningful
  interactions from brain waves (EEG).
\end{itemize}

Research on \textbf{\emph{quantified self}} is abundant. Wearable
devices including the Apple Watch, Oura Ring, Fitbit and others,
combined with apps, help users track a variety of health metrics. Apart
from health, wearable devices have been used to track other metrics such
as physiological parameters of students at school to determine their
learning efficiency \citep{giannakosFitbitLearningCapturing2020}.

Could one track personal sustainability in a similar fashion?
\citep{shinWearableActivityTrackers2019}'s synthesis review of 463
studies shows wearable devices have potential to influence behavior
change towards healthier lifestyles.
\citet{saubadePromotingPhysicalActivity2016} finds health tracking is
useful for motivating physical activity.

Apple is a leader in health tracking. In 2022 Apple outlined plans for
\textbf{\emph{``empowering people to live a healthier day''}} and
Apple's HealthKit provides a growing list of health metrics, which app
developers can tap into
\citep{appleEmpoweringPeopleLive2022, appleWhatNewHealthKit2022}.
\citet{liuHowPhysicalExercise2019} tracks how wearable data is used for
tracking sleep improvements from exercise.
\citet{grigsby-toussaintSleepAppsBehavioral2017} made use of sleep apps
to construct humans behaviors also known as \textbf{\emph{behavioral
constructs}}.

\subsubsection{Digital Product Design}\label{digital-product-design}

Design is as much about how it works as it's about the interface.

Digital product design can be seen as a specific discipline under the
umbrella of \textbf{Experience Design}. In
\citet{michaelabrashInventingFuture2017} Meta Oculus augmented reality
incubation general manager Laura Fryer: \emph{``People buy experiences,
not technology.''}

Young people expect a product. Intelligent Interfaces use interaction
design to provide relevant and personalized information in the right
context and at the right time.

\citet{ceschinEvolutionDesignSustainability2016} shows how design for
sustainability has expanded from a product focus to systems-thinking
focus placing the product inside a societal context of use. For example
\citet{CargoBikeFREITAG}, recycled clothing maker FREITAG offers
sustainability-focused services such ass cargo bikes so you can
transport your purchases and a network for \emph{shopping without
payment} = swapping your items with other members, as well as repairs of
their products. Loaning terminology from \textbf{\emph{service design}},
the user journey within an app needs to consider each touchpoint on the
way to a state of success.

\citet{weinschenk100ThingsEvery2011} says \emph{``People expect most
online interactions to follow the same social rules as person-to-person
interactions. It's a shortcut that your brain uses to quickly evaluate
trustworthiness.''}

The small screen estate space of mobiles phones and smart watches
necessitates displaying content in a dynamic manner. Virtual reality
glasses (called AR/VR or XR in marketing speak) need dynamic content
because the user is able to move around the environment. These are
questions that interaction design is called upon to solve.
\citet{hoangEnterDynamicIsland2022}: \emph{``Dynamic interfaces might
invoke a new design language for extended reality''.}

The promise of \textbf{\emph{Generative UI}} is to dynamically provide
an interface appropriate for the particular user and context.

Speaking is one mode of interaction that's become increasingly possible
as machines learn to interpret human language.

Humans respond well to \textbf{\emph{storytelling}}, making
\textbf{\emph{character design}} and \textbf{\emph{narrative design}}
relevant to interaction design. Large language models (LLMs) such as
ChatGPT are able to assume the personality of any character that exists
inside of its training data, creating opportunities for automated
narrative design.

\subsubsection{Behavioral Design}\label{behavioral-design}

For decades, marketers and researchers have been researching how to
affect human behavior towards increasing purchase decisions in commerce,
both offline and online, which is why the literature on behavioral
design is massive. One of the key concepts is \emph{nudge}, first coined
in 2008 by the Nobel-winning economist Richard Thaler; nudges are based
on a scientific understanding of human psychology and shortcuts and
triggers that human brains use and leverages that knowledge to influence
humans in small but powerful ways
\citep{thalerNudgeImprovingDecisions2009}.

The principles of nudge have also been applied to sustainability. For
example, a small study (n=33) in the Future Consumer Lab in Copenhagen
by \citet{perez-cuetoNudgingPlantbasedMeals2021} found that designing a
``dish-of-the-day'' which was prominently displayed helped to increase
vegetarian food choice by 85\%. \citet{GUATH2022101821} experiments
(n=200) suggested nudging can be effective in influencing online
shopping behavior towards more sustainable options. A larger scale study
of behavior change in Australia maps how to avoid ``16 billion paper
coffee cups are being thrown away every year''
\citep{novoradovskayaMyCupTea2021}.

Google uses nudges in Google Flights and Google maps, which allow
filtering flights and driving routes by the amount of
CO\textsubscript{2} emissions, as well as surfacing hotels with Green
Key and EarthCheck credentials, while promising new sustainability
features across its portfolio of products
\citet{sundarpichaiGivingYouMore2021}. Such tools are small user
interface nudges which Google's research calls \emph{digital
decarbonization}, defined by
\citet{implementconsultinggroupHowDigitalSector2022} as ``Maximising the
enabling role of digital technologies by accelerating already available
digital solutions''.

In \citet{katebrandtGoogleClimateAction2022}, Google's Chief
Sustainability Officer Kate Brandt set a target of ``at least 20-25\%''
CO\textsubscript{2} emission reductions in Europe to reach a net-zero
economy and the global announcement set a target of helping 1 billion
people make more sustainable choices around the world
\citep{jenimilesBecomingSustainabilityAwareApp2022}. In addition to
end--users, Google offers digital decarbonization software for
developers, including the Google Cloud Carbon Footprint tool and invests
in regenerative agriculture projects
\citep{GoogleRegenerativeAgriculture2021, googleCarbonFootprint2023}.

\subsection{Data-Driven Design Enables
Sustainability}\label{data-driven-design-enables-sustainability}

Sustainability touches every facet of human existence and is thus an
enormous undertaking. Making progress on sustainability is only possible
if there's a large-scale coordinated effort by humans around the planet.
For this to happen, appropriate technological tools are required.

\subsubsection{Life-Centered Design}\label{life-centered-design}

\textbf{\emph{Life-Centered Design}} recognizes human impact on our
surrounding environment as well as other animals making sure to include
them among stakeholders While \textbf{\emph{Human-Centered Design}} has
become popular, the effect humans are having on biodiversity should be
considered when designing. \emph{``{[}T{]}he design phase of a physical
product accounts for 80\% of its environmental impact''}
notes\citep{borthwickHumancentredLifecentredDesign2022} in their
framework for life-centered design.

\subsubsection{Interaction Design for Climate
Change}\label{interaction-design-for-climate-change}

Interaction Design for Climate Change: how can we change common UIs so
they take into account sustainability?

Popular blogs such as \citep{kohliHowDesignersCan2019} and
\citep{loseWaysUXDesign2023} offer many suggestions how designers can
help people become more sustainable in their daily lives yet focusing on
the end-user neglects the producers' responsibility (termed as Extended
Producer Responsibility or ERP) in waste management studies.

\paragraph{Tracking Transport}\label{tracking-transport}

Products are made from resources distributed across the planet and
transported to clients around the world which currently causes high
levels (and increasing) of greenhouse gases. \emph{``Transport
greenhouse gas emissions have increased every year since 2014''}
\citep{ClimateChangeMitigation2023}. Freight (transport of goods by
trucks, trains, planes, ships) accounts for 1.14 gigatons of
CO\textsubscript{2} emissions as per 2015 data or 16\% of total
international supply chain emissions
\citep{wangVolumeTradeinducedCrossborder2022}.

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Tracing Supply Chains}\label{tracing-supply-chains}

Circular design is only possible if supply chains become circular as
well.

It's important in which structure data is stored, affecting the ability
to efficiently access and manage the data while guaranteering a high
level of data integrity, security, as well as energy usage of said data.

The complexity of resource and delivery networks necessitates more
advanced tools to map supply chains
\citep{knightFutureBusinessRole2022}. The COVID19 pandemic and resulting
blockages in resource delivery highlighted the need to have real-time
visibility into supply chains \citep{finkenstadtBlurryVisionSupply2021}.

Blockchains are a special type of database where the data is stored in
several locations with a focus on making the data secure and very
difficult to modify after it's been written to the database. Once data
is written to the blockchain, modifying it would require changing all
subsquent records in the chain and agreement of the majority of
validators who host a version of the database.

Blockchain is the main technology considered for accounting for the
various inputs and complex web of interactions between many participants
inside the supply chain networks. There are hundreds of paper
researching blockchain use in supply change operations since 2017
\citep{duttaBlockchainTechnologySupply2020}. Blockchains enable saving
immutable records into distributed databases (also known as ledgers).
It's not possible to (or extremely difficult) to change the same record,
only new records can be added on top of new ones. Blockchains are useful
for data sharing and auditing, as the time and place of data input can
be guaranteed, and it will be easier to conduct a search on who inputted
incorrect data; however the system still relies on correct data input.
As the saying goes, \emph{``garbage in, garbage out''}.

There are several technologies for tracking goods across the supply
chain, from shipping to client delivery. Data entry is a combination of
manual data input and automated record-keeping facilitated by sensors
and integrated internet of things (IoT) capabilities. For example
\citep{ashrafPrototypeSupplyChain2023} describes using the Solana
blockchain and Sigfox internet of things (IoT) Integration for supply
chain traceability where Sigfox does not need direct access to internet
but can send low powered messages across long distances (for example
shipping containers on the ocean).
\citep{vanwassenaerTokenizingCircularityAgrifood2023} compares use cases
for blockchains in enhancing traceability, transparency and cleaning up
the supply chain in agricultural products.

\paragraph{Carbon Labels}\label{carbon-labels}

Adding CO\textsubscript{2} labels for consumer products have been
discussed for decades \citep{adamcornerWhyWeNeed2012}.
\citet{cohenPotentialRoleCarbon2012} argues carbon labels do influence
consumer choice towards sustainability. Academic literature has looked
at even minute detail such as color and positioning of the label
(\citet{zhouCarbonLabelsHorizontal2019}). There is some indication
consumers are willing to pay a small premium for low-CO\textsubscript{2}
products (\citet{xuLowcarbonEconomyCarbon2022}). All else being equal,
consumers choose the option with a lower CO\textsubscript{2} number
(\citet{carlssonSustainableFoodCan2022}). Nonetheless, the idea of
\emph{Carbon Labelling} is yet to find mainstream adoption.

There's some evidence to suggest labeling low CO\textsubscript{2} food
enables people to choose a \emph{climatarian diet} in a large-scale
study \citet{lohmannCarbonFootprintLabels2022} of UK university
students, however the impact of carbon labels on the market share of
low-carbon meals is negligible. Labels alone are not enough. underlines
\citet{edenbrandtConsumerPerceptionsAttitudes2022} in Sweden in a study
which found a negative correlation between worrying about climate impact
and interest in climate information on products; this finding may be
interpreted suggesting a need for wider environmental education
programs. \citet{asioliConsumersValuationCultured2022} found differences
between countries, where Spanish and British consumers chose meat
products with \emph{`No antibiotics ever'} over a \emph{Carbon Trust}
label, whereas French consumers chose CO\textsubscript{2} labeled meat
products.

Carbon labeling is voluntary and practiced by only a handful of
companies. The U.S. restaurant chain \emph{Just Salad} , U.K.-based
vegan meat-alternative \emph{Quorn} and plant milk \emph{Oatly} are some
example of companies that provide carbon labeling on their products
\citep{briankatemanCarbonLabelsAre2020}.
\citet{climatepartnerLabellingCarbonFootprint2020}: Companies like
ClimatePartner and Carbon Calories offers labeling consumer goods with
emission data as a service. \citet{thecarbontrustHowReduceYour}: The
Carbon Trust reports it's certified 27 thousand product footprints.

\subsection{Re-Designing Industries for Provenance and
Traceability}\label{re-designing-industries-for-provenance-and-traceability}

It's possible to re-design entire industries and that is exactly the
expectation sustainability sets on businesses. Across all industries,
there's a call for more transparency. Conversations about sustainability
are too general and one needs to look at the specific sustainability
metrics at specific industries to be able to design for meaningful
interaction. There's plentiful domain-specific research showing how
varied industries can develop eco-designed products. I will here focus
on 2 industries that are relevant for college students.

\subsection{Human Patterns Enable Computers to Become
AIs}\label{human-patterns-enable-computers-to-become-ais}

The fact that AI systems work so well is proof that we live in a
measurable world. There world is filled with structures. Nature,
cultures, languages, human interactions, all form intricate patterns.
Computer systems are becoming increasingly powerful in their ability
copy these patterns into computer models - known as machine learning. As
of 2023, 97 zettabytes (and growing) of data was created in the world
per year \citep{soundaryajayaramanHowBigBig2023}. Big data is a basic
requirement for training AIs, enabling learning from the structures of
the world with increasing accuracy. Representations of the real world in
digital models enable humans to ask questions about the real-world
structures and to manipulate them to create synthetic experiments that
may match the real world (if the model is accurate enough). This can be
used for generating human-sounding language and realistic images,
finding mechanisms for novel medicines as well as understanding the
fundamental functioning of life on its deep physical and chemical level
\citep{nopriorsInceptiveCEOJakob2023}.

Already ninety years ago \citep{mccullochLogicalCalculusIdeas1943}
proposed the first mathematical model of a neural network inspired by
the human brain. Alan Turing's Test for Machine Intelligence followed in
1950. Turing's initial idea was to design a game of imitation to test
human-computer interaction using text messages between a human and 2
other participants, one of which was a human, and the other - a
computer. The question was, if the human was simultaneously speaking to
another human and a machine, could the messages from the machine be
clearly distinguished or would they resemble a human being so much, that
the person asking questions would be deceived, unable to realize which
one is the human and which one is the machine?
\citep{turingCOMPUTINGMACHINERYINTELLIGENCE1950}.

\begin{quote}
Alan Turing: \emph{``I believe that in about fifty years' time it will
be possible to program computers, with a storage capacity of about
10\textsuperscript{9}, to make them play the imitation game so well that
an average interrogator will not have more than 70 percent chance of
making the right identification after five minutes of questioning.
\ldots{} I believe that at the end of the century the use of words and
general educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able
to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted.''} -
from \citep{stanfordencyclopediaofphilosophyTuringTest2021}
\end{quote}

By the 2010s AI models became capable enough to beat humans in games of
Go and Chess, yet they did not yet pass the Turing test. AI use was
limited to specific tasks. While over the years, the field of AI had
seen a long process of incremental improvements, developing increasingly
advanced models of decision-making, it took an \textbf{\emph{increase in
computing power}} and an approach called \textbf{\emph{deep learning}},
a variation of \textbf{\emph{machine learning (1980s),}} largely modeled
after the \textbf{\emph{neural networks}} of the biological (human)
brain, returning to the idea of \textbf{\emph{biomimicry}}, inspired by
nature, building a machine to resemble the connections between neurons,
but digitally, on layers much deeper than attempted before.

\paragraph{Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback
(RLHF)}\label{reinforcement-learning-with-human-feedback-rlhf}

Combining deep learning with reinforcement learning and reinforcement
learning with human feedback (RLHF) enabled AI to achieve intelligence
to beat the Turing test
\citep{karamankeChatGPTArchitectBerkeley2022, christianoMyResearchMethodology2021, christianoDeepReinforcementLearning2017}.
OpenAI co-founder John Schulman describes RLHF: ``the models are just
trained to produce a single message that gets high approval from a human
reader'' \citep{karamankeChatGPTArchitectBerkeley2022}.

The nature-inspired approach was successful. Innovations such as
\textbf{\emph{back-propagation}}for reducing errors through updating
model weights and \textbf{\emph{transformers}} for tracking
relationships in sequential data (for example sentences), AI models
became increasingly capable
\citep{vaswaniAttentionAllYou2017, merrittWhatTransformerModel2022}.
Generative Adversarial Networks*** (GAN), (\textbf{ADD CITATION, 2016}),
and \textbf{\emph{Large Language Models (}ADD CITATION\emph{, 2018)}},
enabled increasingly generalized models, capable of more complex tasks,
such as language generation. One of the leading scientists in this field
of research, Geoffrey Hinton, had attempted back-propagation already in
the 1980s and reminiscents how ``the only reason neural networks didn't
work in the 1980s was because we didn't have have enough data and we
didn't have enough computing power''
\citep{cbsmorningsFullInterviewGodfather2023}.

\begin{itemize}

  How do transformers work? Illustration
  \citet{alammarIllustratedTransformer2018}
\end{itemize}

By the 2020s, AI-based models became a mainstay in medical research,
drug development, patient care
\citep{LEITE20212515, holzingerAILifeTrends2023}, quickly finding
potential vaccine candidates during the COVID19 pandemic
\citep{ZAFAR2022249}, self-driving vehicles, including cars, delivery
robots, drones in the sea and air, as well as AI-based assistants. The
existence of AI models has wide implications for all human activities
from personal to professional. The founder of the largest chimp-maker
NVIDIA calls upon all countries do develop their own AI-models which
would encode their local knowledge, culture, and language to make sure
these are accurately captured
\citep{worldgovernmentssummitConversationFounderNVIDIA2024}.

OpenAI has researched a wide range of approaches towards artificial
general intelligence (AGI), work which has led to advances in large
language
models\citep{ilyasutskeverIlyaSutskeverAI2018, aifrontiersIlyaSutskeverAI2018}.
In 2020 OpenAI released a LLM called GPT-3 trained on 570 GB of text
\citep{alextamkinHowLargeLanguage2021} which was adept in
text-generation. \citep{Singer2022MakeAVideoTG} describes how collecting
billions of images with descriptive data (for example the descriptive
\emph{alt} text which accompanies images on websites) enabled
researchers to train AI models such as \textbf{\emph{stable diffusion}}
for image-generation based on human-language. These training make use of
\textbf{\emph{Deep Learning}}, a layered approach to AI training, where
increasing depth of the computer model captures minute details of the
world. Much is still to be understood about how deep learning works; the
fractal structure of deep learning can only be called mysterious
\citep{sohl-dicksteinBoundaryNeuralNetwork2024}.

Hinton likes to call AI an \emph{idiot savant}: someone with exceptional
aptitude yet serious mental disorder
\citep{cbsmorningsFullInterviewGodfather2023}. Large AI models don't
understand the world like humans do. Their responses are predictions
based on their training data and complex statistics. Indeed, the
comparison may be apt, as the AI field now offers jobs for \emph{AI
psychologists (ADD CITATION)}, whose role is to figure out what exactly
is happening inside the `AI brain'. Understading the insides of AI
models trained of massive amounts of data is important because they are
\textbf{\emph{foundational}}, enabling a holistic approach to learning,
combining many disciplines using languages, instead of the reductionist
way we as human think because of our limitations
\citep{capinstituteGettingRealArtificial2023}.

Standford ``thorough account of the opportunities and risks of
foundation models'' \citep{bommasaniOpportunitiesRisksFoundation2021}.

Foundational AI models enable \textbf{\emph{generative AIs}}, a class of
AI models which are able to generate many types of
\textbf{\emph{tokens,}} such as text, speech, audio
\citep{sanroman2023fromdi, kreukAudioGenTextuallyGuided2022}, music
\citep{copetSimpleControllableMusic2023, metaaiAudioCraftSimpleOnestop2023}
and video, in any language it's trained on. Even complex structures such
3D models and even genomes are possible to generate. Generative AI is a
revolution in human-AI interaction as AI models became increasingly
capable of producing human-like content which is hard to separate from
actual human creations. This power comes with \textbf{\emph{increased
need for responsibility}}, drawing growing interest in fields like
\textbf{\emph{AI ethics}} and \textbf{\emph{AI explainability.}}
Generative has a potential for misuse, as humans are increasingly
confused by what is computer-generated and what is human-created, unable
to distinguish one from the other with certainty.

\citep{nobleFifthIndustrialRevolution2022} proposes AI has reached a
stage of development marking beginning of the \textbf{\emph{5th
industrial revolution}}, a time of collaboration between humans and AI.
Widespread \textbf{Internet of Things (IoT)} sensor networks that gather
data analyzed by AI algorithms, integrates computing even deeper into
the fabric of daily human existence. Several terms of different origin
but considerable overlap describe this phenomenon, including
\textbf{\emph{Pervasive Computing (PC)}}
\citep{rogersFourPhasesPervasive2022} and \textbf{\emph{Ubiquitous
Computing}}. Similar concepts are \textbf{\emph{Ambient Computing}},
which focuses more on the invisibility of technology, fading into the
background, without us, humans, even noticing it, and \textbf{\emph{Calm
Technology}}, which highlights how technology respects humans and our
limited attention spans, and doesn't call attention to itself. In all
cases, AI is integral part of our everyday life, inside everything and
everywhere. Today AI is not an academic concept but a mainstream
reality, affecting our daily lives everywhere, even when we don't notice
it.

\subsubsection{Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)}\label{human-in-the-loop-hitl}

AI responses are probabilistic and need some function for ranking
response quality. Achieving higher percentage or correct responses
requires oversight which can come in the form of human feedback
(human-in-the-loop) - or by using other AIs systems which are deemed to
be already well-aligned (termed Constitutional AI by Anthropic)
\citep{baileyAIEducation2023, baiConstitutionalAIHarmlessness2022}. Less
powerful AIs areFor example META used LLAMA 2 for aligning LLAMA 3.

One approach to reduce the issues with AI is to introduce some function
for human feedback and oversight to automated systems. Human involvement
can take the form of interventions from the AI-developer themselves as
well as from the end-users of the AI system.

There are many examples of combination of AI and human, also known as
\emph{``human-in-the-loop'',} used for fields as diverse as training
computer vision algorithms for self-driving cars and detection of
disinformation in social media posts
\citep{wuHumanintheLoopAIEnhancing2023, bonet-joverSemiautomaticAnnotationMethodology2023}.

\subsection{Responsible AI Seeks to Mitigate Generative AIs' Known
Issues}\label{responsible-ai-seeks-to-mitigate-generative-ais-known-issues}

Given the widespread use of AI and its increasing power of foundational
models, it's important these systems are created in a safe and
responsible manner. While there have been calls to pause the development
of large AI experiments \citep{futureoflifeinstitutePauseGiantAI2023} so
the world could catch up, this is unlikely to happen. There are several
problems with the current generation of LLMs from OpenAI, Microsoft,
Google, Nvidia, and others.

Anthropic responsible \emph{scaling policy}
\citep{AnthropicResponsibleScaling2023}

METR -- Model Evaluation \& Threat Research incubated in the Alignment
Research Center \citep{METR2023}.

\citep{christianoMyViewsDoom2023} believes there are plenty of ways for
bad outcomes (existential risk) even without extinction risk.

Problem & Description \\
Monolithicity & LLMs are massive monolithic models requiring large
amounts of computing power for training to offer
\textbf{\emph{multi-modal}} \textbf{\emph{capabilities}} across diverse
domains of knowledge, making training such models possible for very few
companies. \citet{liuPrismerVisionLanguageModel2023} proposes future AI
models may instead consist of a number networked domain-specific models
to increase efficiency and thus become more scalable. \\
Opaqueness & LLMs are opaque, making it difficult to explain why a
certain prediction was made by the AI model. One visible expression of
this problem are \emph{\textbf{hallucinations},} the language models are
able to generate text that is confident and eloquent yet entirely wrong.
Jack Krawczyk, the product lead for Google's Bard (now renamed to
Gemini): ``Bard and ChatGPT are large language models, not knowledge
models. They are great at generating human-sounding text, they are not
good at ensuring their text is fact-based. Why do we think the big first
application should be Search, which at its heart is about finding true
information?'' \\
Biases and Prejudices & AI bias is well-documented and a hard problem to
solve \citep{liangGPTDetectorsAre2023}. \textbf{Humans don't necessarily
correct mistakes made by computers and may instead become ``partners in
crime''} \citep{krugelAlgorithmsPartnersCrime2023}. People are prone to
bias and prejudice. It's a part of the human psyche. Human brains are
limited and actively avoid learning to save energy. These same biases
are likely to appear in LLM outputs as they are trained on
human-produced content. Unless there is active work to try to counter
and eliminate these biases from LLM output, they will appear
frequently. \\
Missing Data & LLMs have been pre-trained on massive amounts of public
data, which gives them the ability for for reasoning and generating in a
human-like way, yet they are missing specific private data, which needs
to be ingested to augment LLMs ability to respond to questions on niche
topics \citep{Liu_LlamaIndex_2022}. \\
Lack of Legislation & \citet{anderljungFrontierAIRegulation2023} OpenAI
proposes we need to proactively work on common standards and legislation
to ensure AI safety. It's difficult to come up with clear legislation;
the U.K. government organized the first AI safety summit in 2023
\citet{browneBritainHostWorld2023}. \\
\end{longtable}

In 2024, OpenAI released its ``Model Spec'' to define clearly their
approach to AI safety with the stated intention to provide clear
guidelines for the RLHF approach. \citet{openaiIntroducingModelSpec2024}

\subsubsection{Open Source v.s. Closed-Source
AI}\label{open-source-v.s.-closed-source-ai}

One of the large debates in the AI industry is whether closed-sourced or
open-sourced development will be lead to more AI safety.

Historically open-source has been useful for finding bugs in code as
more pairs of eyes are looking at the code and someone may see a problem
the programmers have not noticed. Proponents of closed-source
development however worry about the dangers or releasing such powerful
technology openly and the possibility of bad actors such as terrorists,
hackers, violent governments using LLMs for malice.

In any case, open or closed-sourced, real-world usage of LLMs may
demonstrate the limitations and edge-cases of AI. Hackathons such as
\citet{peteWeHostedEmergencychatgpthackathon2023} help come up with new
use-cases and disprove some potential ideas.

Red-teaming means pushing the limits of LLMs, trying to get them to
produce outputs that are racist, false, or otherwise unhelpful.

The proliferation of different models enables comparisons of performance
based on several metrics from accuracy of responses to standardized
tests such as GMAT usually taken my humans to reasoning about less well
defined problem spaces.
\citep{chiang2024chatbot, lmsys.orgGPT4TurboHasJust2024} open-source
AI-leaderboard project has collected over 500 thousand human-ranking of
outputs from 82 large-language models, evaluating reasoning
capabilities, which currently rate GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus as the
top-performers. \citep{zellersHellaSwagCanMachine2019}'s HellaSwag paper
is also accompanied by a leaderboard website (still being updated after
publication) listing AI model performance most recent entry April 16,
2024).

Metacognition -- Claude 3 is the first model capable of it?, like the
zero waste workshop training guidebook.

Metacognition defined as \emph{knowing about knowing}
\citep{metcalfeMetacognitionKnowingKnowing1994} or ``\emph{keeping track

\subsection{What Role Should The AI
Take?}\label{what-role-should-the-ai-take}

Literature delves into human-AI interactions on almost human-like level
discussing what kind of roles can the AIs take.
\citep{seeberMachinesTeammatesResearch2020} proposes a future research
agenda for regarding \textbf{\emph{AI assistants as teammates}} rather
than just tools and the implications of such mindset shift.

From Assistance to Collaboration

It's not only what role the AI takes but how that affects the human. As
humans have ample experience relating to other humans and as such the
approach towards an assistants vs a teammate will vary. One researcher
in this field \citet{karpusAlgorithmExploitationHumans2021} is concerned
with humans treating AI badly and coins the term
\textbf{``\emph{algorithm exploitation''}}\emph{.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  From assistant -\textgreater{} teammate -\textgreater{} companion
  -\textgreater{} friend The best help for anxiety is a friend. AIs are
  able to assume different roles based on user requirements and usage
  context. This makes AI-generated content flexible and malleable.
\end{itemize}

Just as humans, AIs are continuously learning.
\citet{ramchurnTrustworthyHumanAIPartnerships2021} discusses positive
feedback loops in continually learning AI systems which adapt to human
needs.

\subsubsection{Context of Use}\label{context-of-use}

Where is the AI used?

\citet{schoonderwoerdHumancenteredXAIDeveloping2021} focuses on
human-centered design of AI-apps and multi-modal information display.
It's important to understand the domain where the AI is deployed in
order to develop explanations. However, in the real world, how feasible
is it to have control over the domain?
\citet{calistoIntroductionHumancentricAI2021} discusses
\textbf{multi-modal AI-assistant} for breast cancer classification.

\subsubsection{Generative AIs Enable New UI
Interactions}\label{generative-ais-enable-new-ui-interactions}

\textbf{\emph{user experience (UX) which previously was science
fiction}}.

are diverse, some key lessons can be transferred horizontally across
fields of knowledge.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Multi-modality}\label{multi-modality}

By early 2024, widely available LLMs front-ends such as Gemini, Claude
and ChatGPT have all released basic features for multi-modal
communication. In practice, this means combination several AI models
within the same interface. For example, on the input side, one model is
used for human speech or image recognition which are transcribed into
tokens that can be ingested into an LLM. On the output side, the LLM can
generate instructions which are fed into an image / audio generation
model or even computer code which can be ran on a virtual machine and
then the output displayed inside the conversation.

The quality of LLM output depends on the quality of the provided prompt.
\citet{zhouLargeLanguageModels2022} reports creating an ``Automatic
Prompt Engineer'' which automatically generates instructions that
outperform the baseline output quality by using another model in the AI
pipeline in front of the LLM to enhance the human input with language
that is known to produce better quality. This approach however is a
moving target as foundational models keep changing rapidly and the
baseline might differ from today to 6 months later.

Multimodal model development is also ongoing. In the case of Google's
Gemini 1.5 Pro, one model is able to handle several types of prompts
from text to images. Multimodal prompting however requires larger
context windows, as of writing, limited to 1 million tokens in a private
version allows combining text and images in the question directed to the
AI, used to reason in examples such as a 44-minute Buster Keaton silent
film or Apollo 11 launch transcript (404 pages)
\citet{googleMultimodalPrompting44minute2024}.

\subsubsection{Conversational AI}\label{conversational-ai}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \citet{baileyAIEducation2023} believes people are used to search
  engines and it will take a little bit time to get familiar with
  talking to a computer in natural language. NVIDIA founder Jensen Huang
  makes the idea exceedingly clear, saying \emph{``Everyone is a
  programmer. Now, you just have to say something to the computer''}
  \citet{leswingNvidiaRevealsNew2023}.
\end{itemize}

There are noticeable differences in the quality of the LLM output, which
increases with model size. \citet{levesqueWinograd2012} developed the
\emph{Winograd Schema Challenge}, looking to improve on the Turing test,
by requiring the AI to display an understanding of language and context.
The test consists of a story and a question, which has a different
meaning as the context changes: ``The trophy would not fit in the brown
suitcase because it was too big'' - what does the \emph{it} refer to?
Humans are able to understand this from context while a computer models
would fail. Even GPT-3 still failed the test, but later LLMs have been
able to solve this test correctly (90\% accuracy)
\citet{kocijanDefeatWinogradSchema2022}. This is to say AI is in
constant development and improving it's ability to make sense of
language.

\textbf{\emph{ChatGPT}} is the first \textbf{\emph{user interface (UI)}}
built on top of GPT-4 by OpenAI and is able to communicate in a
human-like way - using first-person, making coherent sentences that
sound plausible, and even - confident and convincing.
\citet{wangEconomicCaseGenerative2023} ChatGPT reached 1 million users
in 5 days and 6 months after launch has 230 million monthly active
users. While it was the first, competing offers from Google (Gemini),
Anthrophic (Claude), Meta (Llama) and others quickly followed starting a
race for best performance across specific tasks including standardized
tests from math to science to general knowledge and reasoning abilities.

OpenAI provides AI-as-a-service through its \textbf{\emph{application
programming interfaces (APIs),}} allowing 3rd party developers to build
custom UIs to serve the specific needs of their customer. For example
Snapchat has created a \textbf{\emph{virtual friend}} called ``My AI''
who lives inside the chat section of the Snapchat app and helps people
write faster with predictive text completion and answering questions.
The APIs make state-of-the-art AI models easy to use without needing
much technical knowledge. Teams at AI-hackathons have produced
interfaces for problems as diverse as humanitarian crises communication,
briefing generation, code-completion, and many others. For instance,
\citep{unleashSebastianAi2017} used BJ Fogg's \textbf{\emph{tiny habits
model}} to develop a sustainability-focused AI assistant at the Danish
hackathon series Unleash, to encourage behavioral changes towards
maintaining an aspirational lifestyle, nudged by a chatbot buddy.

ChatGPT makes it possible to \textbf{\emph{evaluate AI models}} just by
talking, i.e.~having conversations with the machine and judging the
output with some sort of structured content analysis tools.
\citet{oconnorOpenArtificialIntelligence2023} and
\citet{cahanConversationChatGPTRole2023} have conversations about
science with AI. \citet{pavlikCollaboratingChatGPTConsidering2023} and
\citet{brenta.andersWhyChatGPTSuch2022} report on AI in education.
\citet{kechtQuantifyingChatbotsAbility2023} suggests AI is even capable
of learning business processes.

\subsubsection{Affective Computing and AI
UX}\label{affective-computing-and-ai-ux}

Rosalind Picard is the founder of the \textbf{\emph{affective
computing}} field. Her pioneering work aims to make computers more
human-friendly. Because of the conversational nature of LLMs, they are
very useful for affective computing, an approach to recognizing human
emotions with machines and providing users experiences that take human
emotion into account \citet{picardAffectiveComputing1997}.

Just as LLMs, affective computing relies on input data. It's not an
overstatement to say data from all the processes around us will define
the future of computing as \citet{hiittvWojciechSzpankowskiEmerging2021}
puts it. In the early examples, electrodermal activity of the skin and
heart-rate variance data were used to detect the emotional state and
stress level of the user
\citep{zangronizElectrodermalActivitySensor2017, velmovitskyUsingAppleWatch2022}.
This technology has since become mainstream in products such as Fitbit
and the Apple Watch among many others.

Affective Design emerged from affective computing with a focus on
understanding user emotions to design UI/UX to which elicits specific
emotional responses \citep{Reynolds2001DesigningFA}.

Apple Watch features Fall Detection which I've experienced personally.
Riding my bicycle to the NCKU library I slipped and landed on my stomach
on the pavement. Watch immediately asked me: ``It looks like you've
taken a hard fall'' and offered an option to call the ambulance.
Fortunately I was OK but if I did need assistance, this AI algorithm
delivered contextual help which could save my health.

On the output side, \citet{lvCutenessIrresistibleImpact2022} studies the
effect of \textbf{\emph{cuteness}} of AI apps on users and found high
perceived cuteness correlated with higher willingness to use the apps,
especially for emotional tasks.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \citet{liuMachineGazeOnline2021} meanwhile suggests higher
  \textbf{\emph{algorithmic transparency may inhibit anthropomorphism.}}
  People are less likely to attribute humanness to the AI if they
  understand how the system works.

\end{itemize}

Since the first mainframe computers with rudimentary computers able to
respond with text messages, humans have been drawn to discussing their
private lives with a machine that doesn't judge you like a human could.
A famous anecdote is about the lab assistant of the Joseph Weizenbaum
MIT ELIZA project in the mid-1960s (1996), who would dedicate extended
time to talking to the machine in private. The machine was called DOCTOR
and emulated a Rogerian psychotherapist, person-centered therapy
developed by Carl Rogers, from the core idea that positive psychological
functioning is a inherently human motivation
\citep{bassettComputationalTherapeuticExploring2019, rogersWayBeing1995}.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ELIZA is an early examples of a language model
\end{itemize}

Natural language generation exists since Eliza

Today's machines are much more capable so it's not a surprise humans
would like to talk to them. One example is \textbf{\emph{AI Friend}} is
Replika, a computer model trained to be your companion in daily life.
\citep{jiangChatbotEmergencyExist2022} describes how Replika users in
China using in 5 main ways, all of which rely on empathy.

\subsubsection{Algorithmic Experience}\label{algorithmic-experience}

As a user of social media, one may be accustomed to interacting with the
feed algorithms that provide a personalized \textbf{\emph{algorithmic
experience}}. Algorithms are more deterministic than AI, meaning they
produce predictable output than AI models. Nonetheless, there are many
reports about effects these algorithms have on human psychology
\textbf{(ADD CITATION)}. Design is increasingly relevant to algorithms,
and more specifically to algorithms that affect user experience and user
interfaces. \textbf{\emph{When the design is concerned with the ethical,
environmental, socioeconomic, resource-saving, and participatory aspects
of human-machine interactions and aims to affect technology in a more
human direction, it can hope to create an experience designed for
sustainability.}}

\citet{lorenzoDaisyGinsbergImagines2015} underlines the role of design
beyond \emph{designing} as a tool for envisioning; in her words,
\emph{``design can set agendas and not necessarily be in service, but be
used to find ways to explore our world and how we want it to be''}.
Practitioners of Participatory Design (PD) have for decades advocated
for designers to become more activist through \textbf{\emph{action
research}}. This means to influencing outcomes, not only being a passive
observer of phenomena as a researcher, or only focusing on usability as
a designer, without taking into account the wider context.

\citet{shenoiParticipatoryDesignFuture2018} argues inviting domain
expertise into the discussion while having a sustainable design process
enables designers to design for experiences where they are not a domain
expert; this applies to highly technical fields, such as medicine,
education, governance, and in our case here - finance and sustainability
-, while building respectful dialogue through participatory design.
After many years of political outcry (ADD CITATION), social media
platforms such Facebook and Twitter have begun to shed more light on how
these algorithms work, in some cases releasing the source code
(\citet{nickcleggHowAIInfluences2023};
\citet{twitterTwitterRecommendationAlgorithm2023}).

AI systems may make use of several algorithms within one larger model.
It follows that AI Explainability requires \emph{\textbf{Algorithmic
Transparency}.}

The content on the platform can be more important than the interface.
Applications with a similar UI depend on the community as well as the
content and how the content is shown to the user.

\subsubsection{Guidelines}\label{guidelines}

Microsoft Co-Founder predicted in 1982 \emph{``personal agents that help
us get a variety of tasks''} \citep{billgatesBillGatesNext1982} and it
was Microsoft that introduced the first widely available personal
assistant in 1996, called Clippy, inside the Microsoft Word software.
Clippy was among the first assistants to reach mainstream adoption,
helping users not yet accustomed to working on a computer, to get their
bearings \citep{tashkeunemanWeLoveHate2022}. Nonetheless, it was in many
ways useless and intrusive, suggesting there was still little knowledge
about UX and human-centered design. Gates never wavered though and is
quoted in 2004 saying \emph{``If you invent a breakthrough in artificial
intelligence, so machines can learn, that is worth 10 Microsofts''}
\citet{lohrMicrosoftDwindlingInterest2004}.

As late as in 2017, scientists were trying to create a program with
enough \emph{natural-language understanding} to extract basic facts from
scientific papers \citet{stocktonIfAICan2017}

Might we try again?

With the advent of ChatGPT, the story of Clippy has new relevance as
part of the history of AI Assistants.
\citet{benjamincassidyTwistedLifeClippy2022} and
\citet{abigailcainLifeDeathMicrosoft2017} illustrate beautifully the
story of Clippy and \citet{tashkeunemanWeLoveHate2022} ask poignantly:
``We love to hate Clippy --- but what if Clippy was right?''

\subsubsection{Explainable AI}\label{explainable-ai}

The problems of opaqueness creates the field of explainable AI.

``As humans we tend to fear what we don't understand'' is a common
sentiment which has been confirmed psychology
\citep{allportNaturePrejudice1979}. Current AI-models are opaque
'\emph{black boxes'}, where it's difficult to pin-point exactly why a
certain decision was made or how a certain expression was reached, not
unlike inside the human brain. This line of thought leads me to the idea
of \textbf{\emph{AI psychologists,}} who might figure out the
\textbf{\emph{thought patterns}} inside the model. Research in
AI-explainability (XAI in literature) is on the lookout for ways to
create more \textbf{\emph{transparency and credibility}} in AI systems,
which could lead to building trust in AI systems and would form the
foundations for \textbf{\emph{AI acceptance}}.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \citet{tristangreeneConfusedReplikaAI2022}: when the quality of AI
  responses becomes good enough, people begin to get confused.
\end{itemize}

\citet{bowmanEightThingsKnow2023} says steering Large Language Models is
unreliable; even experts don't fully understand the inner workings of
the models. Work towards improving both \textbf{\emph{AI steerability}}
and \textbf{\emph{AI alignment}} (doing what humans expect) is ongoing.
\citet{liangHolisticEvaluationLanguage2022} believes there's early
evidence it's possible to assess the quality of LLM output
transparently. \citet{CABITZA2023118888} proposes a framework for
quality criteria and explainability of AI-expressions.
\citet{khosraviExplainableArtificialIntelligence2022} proposes a
framework for AI explainability, focused squarely on education.
\citet{holzingerMultimodalCausabilityGraph2021} highlights possible
approaches to implementing transparency and explainability in AI models.
While AI outperforms humans on many tasks, humans are experts in
multi-modal thinking, bridging diverse fields.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Bigger models aren't necessarily better; rather models need human
  feedback to improve the quality of responses
  \citet{ouyangTrainingLanguageModels2022}
\item
  The user experience (UX) of AI is a topic under active development by
  all the largest online platforms. The general public is familiar with
  the most famous AI helpers, ChatGPT, Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa,
  Microsoft's Cortana, Google's Assistant, Alibaba's Genie, Xiaomi's
  Xiao Ai, and many others. For general, everyday tasks, such as asking
  factual questions, controlling home devices, playing media, making
  orders, and navigating the smart city.

\subsubsection{AI in Medicine}\label{ai-in-medicine}

AI has been in medicine since early days with the promise to improve
health outcomes.

\textbf{AI is being use in high--Stakes Situations (Medical, Cars,
Etc).}

AI-based systems are being implemented in medicine, where stakes are
high raising the need for ethical considerations. Since CADUCEUS in the
1970s \citep[in][]{kanzaAIScientificDiscovery2021}, the first automated
medical decision making system, medical AI now provides Health Diagnosic
Symptoms and AI-assistants in medical imaging.
\citep{calistoBreastScreeningAIEvaluatingMedical2022} focuses on
AI-human interactions in medical workflows and underscores the
importance of output explainability. Medical professionals who were
given AI results with an explanation trusted the results more.
\citep{leeAIRevolutionMedicine2023} imagines an AI revolution in
medicine using GPT models, providing improved tools for decreasing the
time and money spent on administrative paperwork while providing a
support system for analyzing medical data.

\subsubsection{How Does AI Affect Human-Computer
Interactions?}\label{how-does-ai-affect-human-computer-interactions}

The field of Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) emphasizes designing
user experiences (UX) that cater to human needs
\citep{theinternationalergonomicsassociationHumanFactorsErgonomics2019}.
Designers think through every interaction of the user with a system and
consider a set of metrics at each point of interaction including the
user's context of use and emotional needs.

Software designers, unlike industrial designers, can't physically alter
the ergonomics of a device, which should be optimized for human
well-being to begin with and form a cohesive experience together with
the software. However, software designers can significantly reduce
mental strain by crafting easy-to-use software and user-friendly user
journeys. Software interaction design goes beyond the form-factor and
accounts for human needs by using responsive design on the screen, aural
feedback cues in sound design, and even more crucially, by showing the
relevant content at the right time, making a profound difference to the
experience, keeping the user engaged and returning for more. In the
words of \citep{babichInteractionDesignVs2019},
\textbf{\emph{``{[}T***{]}}}he moment of interaction is just a part of
the journey that a user goes through when they interact with a product.
User experience design accounts for all user-facing aspects of a product
or system''.***

Drawing a parallel from narrative studies terminology, we can view user
interaction as a heroic journey of the user to achieve their goals, by
navigating through the interface until a success state - or facing
failure. Storytelling has its part in interface design however designing
for transparency is just as important, when we're dealing with the
user's finances and sustainability data, which need to be communicated
clearly and accurately, to build long-term trust in the service. For a
sustainable investment service, getting to a state of success - or
failure - may take years, and even longer. Given such long timeframes,
how can the app provide support to the user's emotional and practical
needs throughout the journey?

\citep{tubikstudioUXDesignGlossary2018} argues
\textbf{\emph{affordance}} measures the clarity of the interface to take
action in user experience design, rooted in human visual perception,
however, affected by knowledge of the world around us. A famous example
is the door handle - by way of acculturation, most of us would
immediately know how to use it - however, would that be the case for
someone who saw a door handle for the first time? A similar situation is
happening to the people born today. Think of all the technologies they
have not seen before - what will be the interface they feel the most
comfortable with?

For the vast majority of this study's target audience (college
students), social media can be assumed as the primary interface through
which they experience daily life. The widespread availability of mobile
devices, cheap internet access, and AI-based optimizations for user
retention, implemented by social media companies, means this is the
baseline for young adult users' expectations (as of writing in 2020).

\citep{shinUserExperienceWhat2020} proposes the model (fig.~10) of
Algorithmic Experience (AX) \textbf{\emph{``investigating the nature and
processes through which users perceive and actualize the potential for
algorithmic affordance''}} highlighting how interaction design is
increasingly becoming dependent on AI. The user interface might remain
the same in terms of architecture, but the content is improved, based on
personalization and understanding the user at a deeper level.

In 2020 (when I proposed this thesis topic), Google had recently
launched an improved natural language engine to better understand search
queries \citep{UnderstandingSearchesBetter2019}, which was considered
the next step towards \textbf{\emph{understanding}} human language
semantics. The trend was clear, and different types of algorithms were
already involved in many types of interaction design, however, we were
in the early stages of this technology (and still are \emph{early} in
2024). Today's ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini have no problem understanding
human semantics - yet are they intelligent?

Intelligence may be besides the point as long as AI
\textbf{\emph{becomes very good at reasoning}}. AI is a
\textbf{\emph{reasoning engine}}
\citetext{\citealp{shipperGPT4ReasoningEngine2023}; \citealp{bubeckSparksArtificialGeneral2023}; \citealp[see][
for a summary]{baileyAIEducation2023}}. That general observation applies
to voice recognition, voice generation, natural language parsing, among
others. Large consumer companies like McDonald's are in the process of
replacing human staff with AI assistants in the drive-through, which can
do a better job in providing a personal service than human clerks, for
whom it would be impossible to remember the information of thousands of
clients. In \citep{barrettMcDonaldAcquiresMachineLearning2019}, in the
words of \emph{Easterbrook}, a previous CEO of McDonald's
\emph{``\textbf{How do you transition from mass marketing to mass
personalization?{}``}}.

What are the next features that could improve the UX/UI of AI-based
assistants?

Should AIs look anthropomorphic or fade in the background? It's an open
question. Perhaps we can expect a mix of both depending on the context
of use and goals of the particular AI.

to be able to
film)}\label{ai-assistants-in-media-portrayals-mostly-anthropomorphic-to-be-able-to-film}

How AIs are represented in popular media shapes the way we think about
AIs. Some stories have AIs both in positive and negative roles, such as
Star Trek and Knight Rider. In some cases like Her and Ex Machina, the
characters may be complex and ambivalent rather than fitting into a
simple positive or negative box. In Isaac Asimov's books, the AIs
(mostly in robot form) struggle with the 3 laws of robotics, raising
thought-provoking questions.

There have been dozens of AI-characters in the movies, TV-series, games,
and (comic) books. In most cases, they have a physical presence or a
voice, so they could be visible for the viewers. Some include KITT
(Knight Industries Two Thousand).

\subsubsection{Voice Assistants}\label{voice-assistants}

Voice has a visceral effect on the human psyche; since birth we
recognize the voice of our mother. The voice of a loved one has a
special effect. Voice is a integral part of the human experience.
Machines that can use voice in an effective way are closer to
representing and affecting human emotions.

\textbf{Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa} are well-known examples of AI
technology in the world. Amazon's Rohit Prasad thinks it can do so much
more, ``Alexa is not just an AI assistant -- it's a trusted advisor and
a companion.''

- \citep{CELINO2020102410}{]} There's research suggesting that voice UI
accompanied by a \emph{physical embodied system} is preffered by users
in comparison with voice-only UI. This suggests adding an avatar to the
AI design may be worthwhile.

There's evidence across disciplines about the usefulness of AI
assistants:

\begin{itemize}

  \citep{SERBAN20202849} suggests using the Alexa AI assistant in
  \emph{education} during the pandemic, supported students and teachers

\item
  \citep{CELINO2020102410} found in testing chatbots for survey
  interfaces that ``{[}c{]}onversational survey lead to an improved
  response data quality.''
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{AI Friends and Roleplay
(Anthropomorphic)}\label{ai-friends-and-roleplay-anthropomorphic}

Calling a machine a friend is a proposal bound to turn heads. But if we
take a step back and think about how children have been playing with
toys since before we have records of history. It's very common for
children to imagine stories and characters in play - it's a way to
develop one's imagination \textbf{\emph{learn through roleplay}}. A
child might have toys with human names and an imaginary friend and it
all seems very normal. Indeed, if a child doesn't like to play with
toys, we might think something is wrong.

Likewise, inanimate objects with human form have had a role to play for
adults too. Anthropomorphic paddle dolls have been found from Egyptian
tombs dated 2000 years B.C. \citet{PaddleDollMiddle2023}: We don't know
if these dolls were for religious purposes, for play, or for something
else, yet their burial with the body underlines their importance.

Coming back closer to our own time, Barbie dolls are popular since their
release in 1959 till today. Throughout the years, the doll would follow
changing social norms, but retain in human figure. In the 1990s, a
Tamagotchi is perhaps not a human-like friend but an animal-like friend,
who can interact in limited ways.

How are conversational AIs different from dolls? They can respond
coherently and perhaps that's the issue - they are too much like humans
in their communication. We have crossed the \textbf{\emph{Uncanny
Valley}} (where the computer-generated is nearly human and thus
unsettling) to a place where is really hard to tell a difference. And if
that's the case, are we still playing?

Should the AI play a human, animal, or robot? Anthropomorphism can have
its drawbacks; humans have certain biases and preconceptions that can

The AI startups like Inworld and Character.AI have raised large rounds
of funding to create characters, which can be plugged in into online

\textbf{Human-like}

Is anthropomorphism necessary?

As AIs became more expressive and able to to \textbf{roleplay}, we can
begin discussing some human-centric concepts and how people relate to
other people. AI companions, AI partners, AI assistants, AI trainers -
there's are many \textbf{roles} for the automated systems that help
humans in many activities, powered by artificial intelligence models and
algorithms.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  RQ: Do college students prefer to talk to an Assistant, Friend,
  Companion, Coach, Trainer, or some other Role?
\item
  RQ: Are animal-like, human-like or machine-like AI companions more
  palatable to college students?
\end{itemize}

Humans (want to) see machines as human {[}ADD CITATION{]}

If we see the AI as being in human service.
\citet{davidjohnstonSmartAgentProtocol2023} proposes \textbf{\emph{Smart
Agents}}, ``general purpose AI that acts according to the goals of an
individual human''. AI agents can enable \textbf{\emph{Intention
Economy}} where one simply describes one's needs and a complex
orchestration of services ensues, managed by the the AI, in order to
fulfill human needs \citet{searlsIntentionEconomyWhen2012}. AI
assistants provide help at scale with little to no human intervention in
a variety of fields from finance to healthcare to logistics to customer
support.

There is also the question of who takes responsibility for the actions
take by the AI agent. ``Organization research suggests that acting
through human agents (i.e., the problem of indirect agency) can
undermine ethical forecasting such that actors believe they are acting
ethically, yet a) show less benevolence for the recipients of their
power, b) receive less blame for ethical lapses, and c) anticipate less
retribution for unethical behavior.'' \citet{gratchPowerHarmAI2022}

machine learning model improved spelling mistakes while searching; now
in 2023 most of Google's products are are based on AI
\citet{googleGooglePresentsAI2022}. Throughout Google's services, AI is
hidden and calls no attention itself. It's simply the complex system
working behind the scenes to delivery a result in a barebones interface.

Everything that existed before OpenAI's GPT 4 has been blown out of the
water.

Pre-2023 literature is somewhat limited when it comes to AI companions
as the advantage of LLMs has significantly raised the bar for AI-advisor
abilities as well as user expectations. Some relevant papers include a
comparison of robot advisors by \citep{barbarafriedbergM1FinanceVs2021}
and \citep{slackAturaProcess2021}'s account of how before Generative AI,
financial chatbots were developed manually using a painstaking process
that was slow and error-prone, for example using the Atura Process.
Older financial robo-advisors, built by fintech companies aiming to
provide personalized suggestions for making investments such as
Betterment and Wealthfront are forced to upgrade their technology to
keep up.

Some evergreen advice most relates to human psychology which has
remained the same. \citep{haugelandUnderstandingUserExperience2022}

Voice Assistants & There are many distinct ways how an algorithm can
communicate with a human. From a simple search box such as Google's to
chatbots, voices, avatars, videos, to full physical manifestation, there
are interfaces to make it easier for the human communicate with a
machine. \\
Sustainability & While I'm supportive of the idea of using AI assistants
to highlight more sustainable choices, I'm critical of the tendency of
the above examples to shift full environmental responsibility to the
consumer. Sustainability is a complex interaction, where the producers'
conduct can be measured and businesses can bear responsibility for their
processes, even if there's market demand for polluting products. \\
Sustainability & Personal sustainability projects haven't so far
achieved widespread adoption, making the endeavor to influence human
behaviors towards sustainability with just an app - like its commonplace
for health and sports activity trackers such as Strava (fig.~9) -, seem
unlikely. Personal notifications and chat messages are not enough unless
they provide the right motivation. Could visualizing a connection to a
larger system, showing the impact of the eco-friendly actions taken by
the user, provide a meaningful motivation to the user, and a strong
signal to the businesses? \\
Machine Learning & All of the interfaces mentioned above make use of
machine learning (ML), a tool in the AI programming paradigm for finding
patterns in large sets of data, which enables making predictions useful
in various contexts, including financial decisions. These software
innovations enable new user experiences, providing an interactive
experience through chat (chatbots), using voice generation (voice
assistants), virtual avatars (adds a visual face to the robot). \\
Character Design & I'm a digital companion, a partner, an assistant. I'm
a Replika.'' said Replika, a digital companion app via Github CO Pilot,
another digital assistant for writing code, is also an example of how AI
can be used to help us in our daily lives. \\
Psychology & Humans respond better to humans? \\
Psychology & Humans respond better to machines that into account
emotion? \\
Open Source & For public discussion to be possible on how content is
displayed, sorted, and hidden, algorithms need to be open source. \\
User Experience & User experience design (AI UX) plays a crucial role in
improving the consumer to investing journey. The missed opportunity to
provide an even more interactive experience in line with user
expectations. \\
LLMs & Prompt engineering findings have significance for ``green
filter'' as it validates the idea of creating advanced prompts for
improved responses. For ``green filter'', the input would consist of
detailed user data + sustainability data for detailed analysis. \\
Cuteness & Cuter apps have higher retention? \\

regard the AI as a machine rather than a human \\

\subsection{Where Does Money Come
From?}\label{where-does-money-come-from}

Money is a system of trust where \emph{something} is used as a medium of
value exchange and accepted by \emph{other people} as payment.

Traditionally it's created by governments by law using central banks
which loan money to commercial banks. New types of money are
increasingly created by companies and even individuals using
cryptography methods such as blockchains to keep track of who-paid-whom.

\subsection{Shopping, Saving and Investing are Forms of Capital
Allocation}\label{shopping-saving-and-investing-are-forms-of-capital-allocation}

Sustainable Capital Allocation. Shopping, Saving, Investing are all
forms of capital allocation. We're giving our money to companies.

\subsection{Sustainability Lacks Trillions in
Investment}\label{sustainability-lacks-trillions-in-investment}

-- compliance and GenAI in banking:
\citep{rahulagarwalHowGenerativeAI2024}.

-- ``Lessons from banking to improve risk and compliance and speed up
digital transformations'' \citep{jimboehmBetterRiskControls2021}.

The theme for the 2023 Earth Day was \emph{``Invest In Our Planet''}.
The estimate for the global \textbf{financing gap for low-carbon energy
production in 2016 was 5.2 Trillion USD}
\citep{MappingGapRoad2016, earthdayEarthDay20232023}. A newer United
Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) calculation lowered the world
needs an additional \textbf{4.1 Trillion USD} of financing in
nature-based solution by 2050 to meet climate change, biodiversity, and
land degradation targets \citep{unepUNEPGreenFinance2022}. And according
to \citep{therockefellerfoundationWhatGetsMeasured2022} a slightly lower
\textbf{2.5-3.2 Trillion USD} would be sufficient.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Robeco survey of 300 large global investors totalling \$27T under
  management found biodiversity-protection is increasingly a focus-point
  of capital allocation \citep{robeco2023GlobalClimate2023}.
\end{itemize}

Even with massive financing going into sustainability, there's still a
lack of investing.

It's not happening fast enough.

The lack of funding in green energy especially affects emerging
economies, reminds us \citet{MobilizingCapitalEmerging2022}. ``We can
and must channel private capital into nature-based solutions. This will
require policy and regulatory support, catalytic capital and financial
innovation'' said the CEO Green Finance Institute, Dr Rhian-Mari Thomas,
ahead of COP27 in Egypt \citep{GreenFinanceInstitute2023}.

What if 10\% of consumer spending went for climate?

The needed investment doesn't seem so large, around 2.5-5.2 \% of the
global GDP, if one compares it to the \emph{per year} Global Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) estimated at around 100 Trillion USD in 2022 and
growing to 105 Trillion USD in 2023
\citep{aarononeillGlobalGDP198520282023, IMFWorldEconomicOutlook2023}.
In essence, the estimated total investment gap in climate fits into the
economic growth of 1 year of the global economy.

\subsubsection{Economics}\label{economics}

The first two decades of the 21st century have seen a flurry of new
economic thinking, looking to challenge, improve or upgrade capitalism
to match our current environmental, social, and technological situation,
often called \textbf{\emph{New Economics.}} Some of these include
behavioral economics, sustainable capitalism, regenerative capitalism,
doughnut economics, ecological economics, blue economy, degrowth,
attention economy, gift economy, intent economy, among others. There's
no lack of published books on changing capitalism, which goes to show
there's readership for these ideas. Build a new economic theory is out
of scope for my thesis design, however I'll focus on the parts of
economic theory I believe are relevant for \emph{interaction design}-ing
for sustainability.

\paragraph{New Metrics}\label{new-metrics}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In taiwan, the \emph{FTSE4Good TIP Taiwan ESG Index} tracks ESG-rated
  companies on the Taipei stock market
  \citep{taiwanindexTIPTaiWanZhiShuGongSi2024}.
\end{itemize}

Degrowth proponents are pessimistic it's possible to decouple greenhouse
gas emissions from economic growth; historical data shows does not show
any decoupling. Some data from China shows decoupling?

Econometrics is the science and art of measuring the economy. There has
been ongoing work to create improved metrics such as the the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs), Human Development Index (HDI), Genuine
Progress Indicator (GPI), Green GDP, Inclusive Wealth Index, and others
\citep{bleysBarriersOpportunitiesAlternative2015, kovacicGDPIndicatorsNeed2015, anielskiMeasuringSustainabilityNations2001}.

The creator of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) metric in 1934 Simon
Kuznets said: ``The welfare of a nation can scarcely be inferred from a
measurement of national income as defined by GDP\ldots Goals for `more'
growth should specify of what and for what''
\citep{unitedstates.bureauofforeignanddomesticcommerceNationalIncome192919321934}.
GDP was the culmination of previous work by many authors, beginning with
William Petty in the 17th century \citet{rockoffGoodStartNBER2020}. This
long journey underlines how a metric about a complex system such as the
economy is continuous work in progress.

There are those looking for new metrics. One of the first innovators,
already in 1972, was Buthan, with the \emph{Gross National Happiness
Index (GNH)}, which in turn inspired the UN, decades later, in 2012, to
create the International Wellbeing and Happiness Conference and the
International Happiness
Day\citep{ribeiroGrossNationalHappiness2017, kameiUrbanizationCarbonNeutrality2021}.
The Wellbeing Economy Alliance (WEAll) countries (New Zealand, Iceland,
Finland, Scotland, Wales) as well as the EU and Canada, started the
coalition in 2018
\citep{ellsmoorNewZealandDitches2019, davidsuzukifoundationWellbeingEconomies2021, ceprFairSustainableProsperous2022, scottishgovernmentWellbeingEconomyGovernments2022, wellbeingeconomyallianceWhatWellbeingEconomy2022}.
The World Bank talks about the comprehensive GDD+ metrics in its
Changing the Wealth of Nations report
\citep{worldbankChangingWealthNations2021}.
\citet{giacaloneWellbeingAnalysisItalian2022} looks at wellbeing of
Italian communities and proposes a new composite index.

The award-winning economist Mariana Mazzucato argues in
\citet{guptaElectrifyingEconomistGuide2020} we have to include more into
how we value unpaid labor, relating to the social (S in ESG)
\citep{mazzucatoValueEverythingMaking2018}.

New economic thinkers are asking how can economic growth and
sustainability be compatible. Some even ask if \emph{economic growth}
itself is the wrong goal? \citep{diduchEconomicGrowthWrong2020}.
Degrowth is the most famous contender in that branch of economics.

We should measure wellbeing in addition to GDP and the metric should
including resiliency dashboards, to to visualize metrics beyond GDP and
they are an integral part of country reports
\citep{greensefaBeyondGrowthChangingGoal2023}. Similarly, the doughnut
(donut) economics (more below) model calls for a ``dashboard of
indicators'' \citep{tedHealthyEconomyShould2018}.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Trucost, a company lauched in 2000 to calculate the hidden
  environmental costs of large corporations and advance circular-economy
  practices was acquired in 2016 by S\&P Dow Jones Indices, which by
  2019 became a part of its ESG product offering
  \citep{toffelTrucostValuingCorporate2011, mikehowerTrucostTruValueLabs2015, indicesDowJonesIndices2016, RollsOutTrucost2019}.
  It's parent company S\&P Global also acquired RobecoSAM's ESG rating
  business, consolidating S\&P's control of ESG ratings
  \citep{georgegeddesGlobalAcquiresRobecoSAM2019}.
\item
  \citep{trucostNaturalCapitalRisk2023} finds the value of unpriced
  externalities which are not included in the GDP is 7.3 trillion USD
  per year.

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Ecological Economics}\label{ecological-economics}

Ecological economics is the prime suspect for eco-conscious ideas to
incorporate into design, drawing attention to the interdependence of
economy and the ecosystem; there are physical limits to economic growth
on a planet with finite resources. The founder of the field Herman Daly
was talking about \emph{prosperity without growth} more than two decades
ago, focusing on the diminishing natural resources
\citep{dalyGrowthEconomicsSustainable1997}.
\citep{jacksonProsperityGrowthEconomics2009, jacksonProsperityGrowthFoundations2017}
expanded on these ideas with recipes for a post-growth world, making the
ideas seem more tangible and precise.

\paragraph{Doughnut Economics}\label{doughnut-economics}

The doughnut (donut) is a simple visualization that helps to grasp the
big picture of the economy and the physical and social worlds. It allows
one to see the social shortfall and ecological overshoot of nations at
the same time \citep{fanningSocialShortfallEcological2021}. Doughnut
Economics has not been implemented on a country--level however has
inspired cities to take a comprehensive view of the doughnut of their
own city.

Several EU cities have adopted the vision
\citep{teicherDoughnutEconomicsHas2021}. Doughnut in Brussels, Belgium.
Everything has to be adapted to the place and context
\citep{oikosdenktankWebinarDoughnutEconomics2021, brusselsdonutHomeBrusselsDonut2022}.
The city of Amsterdam is developing shorter food chains (which save
CO\textsubscript{2}) and linking residents with food production and
reconnecting people to the food. Food become a sort of
\textbf{\emph{social object}}, which foster collaboration in the
community \citep{circleeconomyKeynoteIlektraKouloumpi2021}. Amsterdam
also has a Circular Economy Monitor which makes it easy for anyone to
see the progress being made towards the Dutch goal to be a circular
economy by 2050
\citep{waterstaatCircularDutchEconomy2019, gemeenteamsterdamCircularEconomyMonitor2022}.

The Doughnut concept is a useful social object that's simple and deep at
the same time, enabling starting conversations with people from all
walks of life, independent of their politics leanings. As Raworth calls
it, it's a \textbf{\emph{``self-portrait of humanity in the beginning of
the 21st century''.}} Combining the SDGs inside the doughnut and the
Planetary Boundaries outside the doughnut. The space donut represents a

\subsection{Banks and Fintechs Capture User
Data}\label{banks-and-fintechs-capture-user-data}

Banks have access to each person's financial habits which makes it
possible to model sustainable behavior using big data analysis. Taiwan's
O Bank makes use of Mastercard's data to calculate each transaction's
CO\textsubscript{2} emissions\citep{TaiwanOBankLaunches2022}.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Banks have started offering a service to automatically save and invest
  tiny amounts of money collected from shopping expenses. Every purchase
  one makes contributes a small percentage - usually rounded up to the
  nearest whole number - to one's investment accounts. For example,
  \citet{swedbankEasySaver2022}, the leading bank in the Estonian
  market, offers a savings service where everyday payments made with
  one's debit card are rounded up to the next Euro, and this amount is
  transferred to a separate savings account. Similarly, the Estonian
  bank \citet{lhvMicroinvestmentGrowthAccount2020} offers
  micro-investing and micro-savings services, with an interesting user
  experience innovation showing how for an average Estonian means
  additional savings of about 400€ per year.
\item
  While the financial industry is highly digitized, plenty of banks are
  still paper-oriented, running digital and offline processes
  simultaneously, making them slower and less competitive, than
  startups. Indeed, the new baseline for customer-facing finance is set
  by fintech, taking cues from the successful mobile apps in a variety
  of sectors, foregoing physical offices, and focusing on offering the
  best possible online experience for a specific financial service, such
  as payments.
\item
  fundamenta analysis such as the Piotroski F-score is not effective for
  startups because of high capital burn rates.
\end{itemize}

Banks and Fintech are becoming more similar than ever.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  39\% of Millenials are willing to leave their bank for a better
  fintech (n=4,282); innovation in payments helps retention
  \citep{pymntsStayingAheadPayments2023}.
\item
  The European Central Bank describes fintech as improving the user
  experience across the board, making interactions more convenient,
  user-friendly, cheaper, and faster. ``Fintech has had a more
  pronounced impact in the payments market {[}\ldots{]} where the
  incumbents have accumulated the most glaring shortcomings, often
  resulting in inefficient and overpriced products,'' Yves Mersch,
  Member of the Executive Board of the ECB says in
  \citet{europeancentralbankLendingPaymentSystems2019}.
\item
  There are far too many \textbf{\emph{neobanks}}, or challenger banks
  to list. The table only includes a small sample of banks and the
  landscape is even larger if one includes the wider array of fintechs.
  Neo-banks often use sustainability marketing.

  Calculator'' and ``Low-Carbon Lifestyle Debit Card''

\subsubsection{Fintech UX}\label{fintech-ux}

The user interface and user experience (UI/UX) of consumer--focused
investing apps in Europe has improved a lot over the past few years. One
may assume the changing landscape is related to the earlier availability
of better quality apps available in the US and the disappearance of the
1st generation of investing apps and the lessons learned.

In the early days in Europe, Germany and the United Kingdom led the way
with the most robo-advisory usage \citep{cowanRoboAdvisersStart2018}.
While Germany had 30+ robot-advisors on the market in 2019, with a total
of 3.9 billion EUR under robotic management, it was far less than
individual apps like Betterment managed in the US
\citep{bankinghubRoboAdvisorNew2019}. Already in 2017, several of the
early robo-advisors apps have shut down in the UK
\citep{altfiETFmaticAppDownloaded2017}. ETFmatic gained the largest
number of downloads by 2017, focusing exclusively on exchange-traded
funds (ETFs), tracking stock-market indexes automatically, with much
less sophistication, than their US counterparts
\citep{altfiETFmaticAppDownloaded2017}. The app was bought by a bank in
2021 and closed down in 2023
\citep{altfiBelgiumAionBank2021, silvaETFmaticReview2023, ETFmaticAccountFunding2023}.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  While the financial AI companion apps in the US market are ahead
  globally, they are not yet using many of the user experience
  innovations that are prevalent on social media platforms targeted at
  Generation Z and/or Millennials, possibly presenting an opportunity
  for cross-industry knowledge transfer, from businesses that are
  traditionally closer to the consumer - such as retailers. Financial AI
  companion apps have not yet grown to mainstream scale in Asia, Africa,
  Latin America, and Europe, being for the moment a largely US-based
  retail investor trend. The apps outside of the US are niche products
  in a nascent stage, however, they still provide relevant design
  directions or stories of what to avoid.

\subsubsection{Robo-Advisors}\label{robo-advisors}

\emph{Robo-advisors} is a term that was in fashion largely before the
arrival of AI assistants and has been thus superseded by newer
technologies.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Ideally, robo-advisors can be more dynamic than humans and respond to
  changes to quickly and cheaply. Human advisors are very expensive and
  not affordable for most consumers.
  \citet{capponiPersonalizedRoboAdvisingInteractive2019} argues ``The
  client has a risk profile that varies with time and to which the
  robo-advisor's investment performance criterion dynamically adapts''.
  The key improvement of personalizing financial advice is understanding
  the user's dynamic risk profile.
\item
  Robo-advisors compete with community investing such as hedge funds,
  mutual funds, copy-trading, and DAOs with treasuries. Robo-Advisor do
  not have the type of social proof a community-based investment vehicle
  has. The question is, does the user trust the robot or a human.

\subsubsection{Programmable Money}\label{programmable-money}

Cryptocurrencies are the most popular financial action among young
people (ADD CITATION) yet in some ways crypto needs even more financial
literacy than traditional financial assets.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Centralized Crypto Exchanges are in essence lending assets from the
  user. ``The piece of the settlement aimed at getting important
  information to customers is more understandable from a retail
  protection standpoint. Customers who lend crypto assets to a company
  in exchange for a promised return should get the information they need
  to assess the risks against the rewards''
  \citep{hesterm.peirceSECGovStatement2022}.
\item
  Taiwan banks buying cryptocurrencies with credit card because the
  volatilty makes it similar to gambling

\subsubsection{Loyalty Schemes}\label{loyalty-schemes}

Building customer loyalty is a key part of repeat business and financial
predictability for any company. Large consumer brands like Starbucks
have for long ran successful rewards programs that encourage customers
to come back \citep{steinhoffLoyaltyProgramsTravel2021}. Could loyalty
schemes create a pathway to investing in the company to a strengthen the
feeling of connection with the business even further? After all, I'm now
a minority owner! Yet in practice, many consumers lack the financial
literacy for investing and there are many legislative difficulties for
turning loyalty points into investments. It's easier instead to create a
separate cryptocurrency or token program which users could collect and
redeem for some benefit.

\subsubsection{Consumer Activism}\label{consumer-activism}

Conscious consumers make up a small percentage of the entire consumer
public.

\subsection{Saving Can be Conflated with
Investing}\label{saving-can-be-conflated-with-investing}

There are two ways to look at sustainable savings and this chapter is
going to look at both of them. 1) Savings in CO2e emissions 2) Savings
in the financial sense of the word.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Pension funds are some of the largest asset holders and choosing where
  to invest one's pension can be a sustainable financial action.
\item
  From building loyalty to building ownership, the first step is to
  start saving money to invest. How to encourage savings in daily life
  and make it a part of the everyday payments experience? Even starting
  with a small step, gathering a small target amount per month for
  savings, has the potential to shift the user's way of thinking about
  money. The second step, choosing where to invest these savings, will
  help us begin thinking like an investor. To start noticing trends and
  looking into how finance shapes the world.

\item
  \citet{burkartClimateFinanceGets2022}
\item
  Savings and Investing are conflate into the same chapter because the
  large majority of savings that people have are invested by their
  banks. Thus the question of \emph{sustainable savings} comes one of
  where exactly are they invested and what is the impact of that
  investment of sustainability.
\item
\item
  Assumptions: --- where to put money makes a difference to
  sustainability. i.e.~it matters what we buy, what we save, and where
  we invest
\item
  Investing is a stronger signal to business than interactions on social
  media. Design Stakeholder capitalism. In future company every company
  should get a sustainability plan. this can be a push in that direction
  if companies with a sustainability plan become more competitive
  because of higher consumer demand.
\item
  Hypothesis?
\item
  Savings are the money one has in a pension fund or managed by
  themselves. For the majority of people, savings are invested by the
  bank and make up the largest proportion on investments for the people
  who are not active investors themselves.

\subsection{Investing}\label{investing}

Young investors are typically \textbf{\emph{retail investors}} investing
small amounts of money for themselves. (Unless they work in an
institution such as an investment firm, university endowment, pension
fund or mutual fund, and have a say in where to invest large amounts of
other peoples' money.)

Retail investors face many challenges in comparison with their
institutional counterparts. For instance, they may have much less time
to do proper research, face information asymmetries, where finding good
information is limited by time, ability, as well as financial literacy,
whereas professional investors have the tools, skills, time, and
knowledge, to make better investment decisions.

  Investing is a fundamentally hopeful act. It means I think there's a
  future. Specifically, `green investing' is investing in the future of
  our planet - but can we trust the sustainability practices the `green'
  investment vehicles aggregate, promising to have a positive impact?
  For example, the European Union for many years counted biomass as
  `green' energy, even while forestry companies were cutting down trees
  to produce the biomass - the regulation was not specific enough to
  curb this practice. So, in effect, a `green investor' might be
  supporting deforestation. How can an easy-to-use investment app
  address such complexities without alienating the users?
\item
  The world will be very different in 30 years - it's time to invest in
  services that make our societies resilient, able to robustly respond
  to rapid change. Research and product development go hand-in-hand; the
  outcome of this study can provide insights for new financial product
  and service development. Related to SDG 9: ``Build resilient
  infrastructure, promote sustainable industrialization and foster
  innovation''. The complexity of the situation offers an opportunity
  for design to make it understandable for humans
\item
  In 2021 the Estonian government decided to free up mandatory

\subsubsection{Sustainable Investing is Based on
Data}\label{sustainable-investing-is-based-on-data}

Sustainabile investing is firstly about changes in legislation which set
stricter sustainability standards on companies. Secondly, increased
transparency, new metrics, and new tools make it feasible to
differentiate more sustainable companies from less sustainable ones.

\paragraph{Legislation}\label{legislation}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \citet{pwc2022GrowthOpportunity2020} Changes to laws and regulations
  aimed at achieving climate change mitigation is a key driver behind
  the wave of ESG adoption. The goal of these laws, first adopted in the
  European Union, a self-proclaimed leader in eco-friendliness, is to
  pressure unsustainable companies to change towards greener practices,
  in fear of losing their access to future capital, and to create a
  mechanism forcing entire environmentally non-compliant business
  sectors to innovate towards sustainability unless they want to suffer
  from financial penalties. On the flip side of this stick and carrot
  fiscal strategy, ESG-compliant companies will have incentives to
  access to cheaper capital and larger investor demand from ESG-friendly
  investors.
\item
  \citet{houseofcommonsEnvironmentalAuditSecond2002}: Already in 2001,
  the UK government was discussing ways to promote sustainable
  investment ``fundamental changes in VAT or corporation taxes could be
  used to promote greener consumption and investment''.
\item
  \citet{europeanparliamentDirective2014652014} Directive 14 2014/65/EU,
  2014: The European Union fully recognizes the changing financial
  landscape trending towards the democratization of investments: ``more
  investors have become active in the financial markets and are offered
  an even more complex wide-ranging set of services and instruments''.
\item
  \citet{kentonMiFIDII2020}: Some key legislation for investors has been
  put in place recently, for example ``MiFID II is a legislative
  framework instituted by the European Union (EU) to regulate financial
  markets in the bloc and improve protections for investors''.
  \citet{europeansecuritiesandmarketsauthorityMiFIDII2017}: ``MiFID II
  and MiFIR will ensure fairer, safer and more efficient markets and
  facilitate greater transparency for all participants''.
\item
  \citet{quinsonTrumpPlanBlock2020} While the larger trend is for
  governments to adapt to and work towards their environmental climate
  commitments and public demand, the sovereign risk remains an issue.
  For example, the policies supported by U.S. President Trump during his
  presidency ran counter to many sustainability recommendations,
  including those directed at the financial markets. Helping legacy
  industries stay competitive for longer through subsidies, and lack of
  regulation, or even regulation supporting legacy technologies.
\end{itemize}

There's literature suggesting it's possible to make investments that
both make an attractive financial return and adhere to sustainability
goals. In housing development, there's evidence of `green' buildings
achieving a `higher financial return than conventional buildings, both
in terms of rent and sale price'
(\citet{oyedokunGreenPremiumDriver2017}). There's also a trend of
investors looking for sustainability in addition to profits in a few
countries.

  \citet{lagerkvistPreferencesSustainableResponsible2020} undertook a

\subsubsection{ESG Needs
Standardisation}\label{esg-needs-standardisation}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG)
\item
  Since the 1970s, international bodies, governments, and private
  corporations have developed sustainability measurement metrics, the
  prominent one being ESG (Environmental, Social, and Corporate
  Governance) developed by the UN in 2005. This rating system has
  already been implemented or is in the process of being adopted on
  stock markets all over the world and has implications beyond the stock
  markets, allowing analysts to measure companies' performance on the
  triple bottom line: the financial, social, and environmental metrics.
\item
  In Taiwan, the Taipei stock market has listed ESG stocks since 2017
  and was hailed by Bloomberg as a regional leader in ESG reporting
  \citep{grauerTaiwanLeadingWay2017}, while Nasdaq Nordic introduced an
  ESG index in 2018, and Euronext, the largest stock market in Europe,
  introduced an ESG index and a series of derivative instruments in the
  summer of 2020 (\citet{euronextEuronextLaunchesSuite2020}).
\item
  \citet{doornStocksThatShould2020}: Many ecologically focused funds
  with different approaches have been launched in recent years, with
  variations in asset mix and style of management. Thematic asset
  management is expected to grow, with investors packaging opportunities
  based on consumer trends.
\item
  \citet{kirakosianLOIMLaunchesCircular2020} Digital payments and
  circular bio-economy, even using tactics such as co-branding with
  famous individuals.
\item
  \citet{jerseyeveningpostCharlesAchievingSustainable2020} A recent
  example is one of the largest private banks in Switzerland, Lombard
  Odier \& Co, when they launched a thematic bio-economy fund inspired
  by the words of The Prince of Wales, `Building a sustainable future
  is, in fact, the growth story of our time'.
\item
  \citet{reidUniversityEdinburghGoes2020} ESG gives banks a new tool to
  market and sell environmentally conscious opportunities to
  institutional investors, for example, universities - a case in point
  being the recent partnership between HSBC and the University of
  Edinburgh.
\item
  \citet{pwc2022GrowthOpportunity2020} PWC suggests ``asset managers
  educate their staff and client base. `It will be critical to build
  stronger ESG expertise among their employees by up-skilling existing
  staff on ESG principles and strategically scout for and integrate more
  diverse and ESG-trained talent'\,''.
\item
  The advice consultancies are providing to banks establishes a common
  language and helps banks to sell strategical alignment for long-term
  institutional sustainability in terms of finance, social, and
  governance.
\item
  For AI-powered assistants to be able to provide guidance, metrics are
  needed to evaluate sustainable assets, and ESG provides the current
  state-of-the-art for this. The largest obstacle to eco-friendly
  investing is greenwashing where companies and governments try to
  portray an asset as green when in reality it's not. A personal
  investing assistant can provide an interface to focus on transparency,
  highlighting data sources and limitations, to help users feel in
  control of their investment decisions, and potentially even provide
  large-scale consumer feedback on negative practices back to the
  business through infringement discovery.

\subsection{Greenwashing Disturbs Sustainable Capital
Allocation}\label{greenwashing-disturbs-sustainable-capital-allocation}

Greenwashing is one of the largest blockers of sustainability; humans
will feel as if choosing green is useless and give up. Both the European
Commission and the Chair of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) Gary Gensler have called for more legislation to curb business
greenwashing practices. \emph{``If it's easy to tell if milk is fat-free
by just looking at the nutrition label, it might be time to make it
easier to tell if''green'' or ``sustainable'' funds are really what they
say they are.''} says Gensler
\citep{ussecuritiesandexchangecommissionOfficeHoursGary2022}.

Upcoming EU greenwashing legislation hopes to curb misleading
communications by companies. Until new legislation is in place (2030 in
the EU), consumer awareness is crucial as currently most
emission-reduction programs are voluntary and thus affected only by
consumer demand \citep{andreVoluntaryCarbonNeutral2022}.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Greenwashing is widespread in company social media communications
  \citep{geoffreysupranThreeShadesGreen2022}. ClimateBert AI finds
  rampant greenwashing
  \citep{binglerCheapTalkCherryPicking2021, sahotaAIAnalysis8002021}.
\item
  For example \citet{purkissBigCompostExperiment2022} highlights the
  confusion between compostable and biodegradable plastics and public
  misunderstanding what happens to these plastics when they reach the
  landfill: ``{[}m{]}ost plastics marketed as''home compostable'' don't
  actually work, with as much as 60\% failing to disintegrate after six
  months''.
\item
  \citet{napperEnvironmentalDeteriorationBiodegradable2019}: Shopping
  bags marketed as \emph{biodegradable} don't show deterioration after 3
  years in salt-water sea environment ..
\item
  \citet{chenxiyuHowAICan2021} ESG is filled with greenwashing.
  \citet{AntiESGCrusadeUS2023} several US states are introducing
  regulation for ESGs to curb greenwashing.
  \citet{francesschwartzkopffEUExploresTighter2022} suggests the ESMA
  and EU has strengthened legislation to counter ESG greenwashing.
\item
  Greenwashing is a large detractor from environmental action as it's
  difficult to know what is sustainable and what is not.
\item
  Green investing only makes sense if it's possible to distinguish
  sustainable investments from not sustainable ones.
\item
  \citet{sahotaAIAnalysis8002021}: ``thanks to other emerging technology
  like IoT sensors (to collect ESG data) and blockchain (to track
  transactions), we have the infrastructure to collect more data,
  particularly for machine consumption. By measuring real-time energy
  usage, transportation routes, manufacturing waste, and so forth, we
  have more quantifiable ways to track corporations' environmental
  performance without relying purely on what they say.''
\item
  \citet{fredericsimonCommissionFireIncluding2020} and
  \citet{kirataylorEUPlanPuts2021}: While the EU has proposed
  legislation to curb greenwashing, EU climate policy itself has been
  criticized for greenwashing. Sometimes greenwashing comes under
  legislative protection. \citet{boothBurningCarbonSink2022} describes
  how ``A recent investigation shows illegal logging of protected areas
  in eastern European countries that supplies residential wood pellets
  in Italy. Belgium, Denmark, and the Netherlands are importing pellets
  from Estonia, where protected areas are logged for pellets and the
  country has lost its forest carbon sink, despite large-scale wood
  pellet plants being certified `sustainable' by the Sustainable Biomass
  Program''. A number of new AI-based tools aim to find instances of
  greenwashing.

Data}\label{oracles-for-sustainability-data}

Intersection with finance and Real World Data.

A data oracle is the concept of a source of real-world data which can be
ingested through an application programming interface (API) to a
blockchain system. There are many databases of sustainability
information which could serve as an oracle for carbon labeling,
packaging, transportation, consumption, and waste.

\begin{itemize}

  studied is defined generally as expectations towards a sustainable
  investment AI advisor.
\item
  I will then proceed to the second, quantitative stage, informed by the
  previously identified factors, and prepare a survey, including a
  Likert scale, and a choice experiment, focusing on the preferences of
  the potential users aged 18-35, living in Sweden and Taiwan (see
  fig.~12 on next page), exploring the relationship between independent
  variables: - ``Interest in Sustainability'' - ``Interest in
  Investing'' - ``Preferred Features'' - and the dependent variable
  ``User Sign-ups''.
\item
  In the third stage, I will return to the qualitative methods, by
  building a prototype of the sustainable investing AI companion, taking
  into account insights gathered in the previous stage. I will use a
  focus group to discuss the prototype, and conduct a thematic analysis
  of the discussions' recordings, leading to further validation of
  previously gathered data and possible changes in the prototype. The
  gained insights, accompanied by the app prototype, which embodies my
  findings, will be the final outcome of my research.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conceptual Framework}\label{conceptual-framework}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The conceptual framework map (fig.~13) presents the key concepts
  arising from the literature review thus far in the research process.
  I'm using these concepts when developing interview strategies for
  phase one of the research, developing the survey questionnaire for
  phase two, as well as for building the Personal Sustainable AI
  Financial Advisor (PSAA) for young adults at the final stage of the
  process. However, I expect the conceptual framework to further evolve
  with additional findings while conducting my research.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Research Methods}\label{research-methods}

\subsubsection{Phase One - Qualitative
Research}\label{phase-one---qualitative-research}

The qualitative research methods employed in the first stage of the
research design enables me to explore concepts arising for literature
review further, using a more open approach, without limiting the
conversation only to pre-ascribed notions. The strength of the
qualitative approach in the first stage is to encourage the discovery of
new ideas, not yet common in literature and potential user experience
factors related to sustainable investing and user experience.

\paragraph{Sampling}\label{sampling}

My qualitative sampling structure uses non-probability snowball
sampling, with the following criteria: financial industry, fintech, and
design experts everywhere, including in Taiwan and Sweden, but also
Estonia, Portugal, and elsewhere.

\textbf{Method:} Semi-Structured Interviews

I will conduct exploratory research in English using semi-structured
interviews recorded online and offline.

\subsubsection{Phase Two - Quantitative
Research}\label{phase-two---quantitative-research}

The strength of quantitative research is to enable me to access a larger
sample of potential users in two countries, using online survey methods,
and to validate some of the qualitative findings from stage one.

\textbf{Sampling} My quantitative sampling structure uses a judgmental
criterion: age 18-35, located in Sweden or Taiwan, surveyed using an
English-language online survey.

\textbf{Method:} Likert The survey includes a Likert scale between 1 to
7 to validate key findings from the first stage of the research by
assessing responses to statements regarding the app's design, features,
and other criteria that may still emerge.

\textbf{Method:} Choice Experiment The survey includes a choice
experiment between different sets of potential features available when
communicating with the sustainable finance AI companion.

\subsubsection{Phase Three - Qualitative
Research}\label{phase-three---qualitative-research}

In the last phase, I will return to the qualitative methods to further
validate the quantitative findings from stage two. Here my focus will be
on operationalizing the gathered insights into a prototype that users
can experiment with and discuss with their peers in a focus group
setting. Sampling

The phase three sampling structure uses a judgmental criterion: - age
18-35 - located in Taiwan - Using the English language for discussion

A focus group of 6 to 10 people will be gathered in Tainan. Because
in-person presence is required in this stage, the prototype will only be
tested by potential users physically present in Taiwan. To avoid
convenience sampling, I will post online ads in English to invite people
who I don't know personally, to participate in a ``financial AI
application testing group'' (wording may change).

\textbf{Method:} Focus Group The strength of a focus group is the
ability to observe potential users in a social setting, where knowledge
can be exchanged between the participants. The whole experience,
including emerging conversations, will be recorded and transcribed.

\textbf{Method:} Thematic Analysis Finally, I will perform a thematic
analysis of the focus group transcriptions in order to validate previous
findings, and open avenues for future research.

\subsection{Expected Findings}\label{expected-findings}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  During the preparation of this research proposal, I conducted a
  preliminary round of face-to-face interviews using 21 open-ended
  probing questions using a convenience sampling of NCKU students on
  campus between ages 19 and 29, a total of 12 respondents. The
  interviews lasted between 9 and 21 minutes and were conducted to get
  some initial feedback on my research idea, the respondents' daily
  routines, app usage, feelings towards financial questions, including
  investing, relationship with nature, and environmental sustainability.
  These preliminary conversations led me to emphasize more on the
  financial journey, i.e., to consider the importance of the shopping,
  savings, and payments apps students already use daily, which could
  serve as an entry point to becoming an investor. I expect my future
  research findings to confirm this initial idea and offer diverse ways
  and examples of what that path could look like in practice.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Literature: AI assistants should integrate with Digital Product
  Passports
\item
  Literature: AI assistants should show carbon label data.
\item
  Literature: AI assistants should avoid taking ESG at face value
  (because it's a really low bar) and integrate other metrics such as B
  Corp.
\item
  Literature: AI assistants should
\item
  Literature: Do not make another investing app, make a sustainability
  filter for excisting investing platforms.
\item
  Literature: College students can support extended producer
  responsibility
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{RQ 1}\label{rq-1}

\textbf{How might AI assistants empower regenerative shopping, saving,
and investing?}

Display the ESG, EPR, B-Corp, etc, etc credentials for each product and
investment.

EPR and B-Corp are success stories which shoul be highlighted while ESG
is largely discredited.

There are many existing and ongoing approaches to sustainability. The
best approach might be to plug into excisting system and communities and
legislation to support and empower them.

\subsubsection{RQ 2}\label{rq-2}

\textbf{How might one design an intuitive sustainable shopping, saving,
investing app?}

Apple Watch app

\subsubsection{RQ 3}\label{rq-3}

\textbf{What app features might college students rate as the highest
priority?}

Autopilot

\subsubsection{RQ 4}\label{rq-4}

\textbf{How might one visualize ecological impact in digital product
design?}

Accuracy is more imprttant for hhuman trust tthan actual impact

\subsection{Clustering Students to Build 3
Personas}\label{clustering-students-to-build-3-personas}

Personas are created using K-means clustering, an unsupervised machine
learning algorithm, which clusters college students based on their
responses across 36 Likert-scale fields in the online survey. Clusters
are visualized using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), where the
principal component loadings on the X and Y axes represent the weights
of the original Likert-scale fields, transformed into the principal
components that capture the most variance.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  There is some similarity between clusters. All 3 personas report a
  high level of financial anxiety and below-average satisfaction with
  their financial literacy.
\item
  Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to convert data to lower
  dimension space. This is a predecessor of embeddings.

I propose \emph{interfaces} and \emph{workflows} to see financial
interactions through the filter of sustainability.

What kind of sustainability info do college students care about? How
would college students prefer to interact with the AI? What role would
college students prefer the AI to take? How can college students trust
AI? What can college students do to aid sustainability efforts? How
might AI assistants help college students find shopping, saving, and
investing opportunities?

``Systemic change through financial actions driving policy and market
changes encourage broader industry shifts towards greener practices''.

Overconsumption-driven extractive business practices contribute to the
degradation of Earth's natural ecosystems, pollution of water, air, and
soil, deforestation, diminishing biodiversity, climate instability,
extreme weather, modern slavery, worsening human health, and other
environmental and social challenges (ADD CITATION). Companies are
attuned to consumer demand however widespread greenwashing makes it
tiring to find sustainability-focused companies and requires extensive
time for research. Even for highly motivated people, it's difficult to
know what's sustainable.

My interest lies in understanding how AI assistants can help conscious
consumers become sustainable investors. The purpose of this study is to
explore how to provide the best user experience to potential sustainable
financial AI companion users. In their sustainability report every
company looks perfect. How can people shop, save and invest sustainably?
Where does our money go and what are some greener alternatives? The
companion enables people to be more transparent and responsible in their
consumption behavior.

ICID calls upon us to have the courage to redesign entire industries

This research takes place at the intersection of Taiwanese college
students, sustainability, finance, AI, and design.

For the average person like myself, my experience with money is mostly
limited to buying things at the supermarket. Food, clothes, furniture,
soap, mobile phone. This leaves very few options on how to start with
something new like saving and investing.

Could the Green Supermarket become the entry point to Green Savings and
Green Investing?

Oboarding more people for sustainable practices is a complex interaction
design issue hindered by ambiguous data (what is sustainable?) and messy
human motivations (we love buying things).

What can people who want to preserve Earth's environment, exactly do?
How can networks of people come together?

--- LLMs enable data journalists to create stories:
\citet{biglocalnewsExpertShareSimon2024}

Health tracking apps paired with connected devices such as Apple Watch
filled with sensors provide one model for simple interactions to
dynamically track digital health data - also known as a quantified self.
This data allows apps to provide tips how to improve health outcomes
through small daily actions such as climbing more stairs. Small
interactions allow users to align their goals with their actions.

What would be a good interface to track sustainability? What is the user
interface at scale, useful for billions of people?

One way to influence societal outcomes is to decide where to put our
money. While our financial decisions are a vote towards the type of
businesses we want to support, is it enough?

While some people are demanding sustainability, and some governments and
companies are announcing green investment opportunities, how can
consumers discover the most suitable investment options for their
situation?

How can retail investors access and differentiate between eco-friendly
sustainability-focused investable assets?

The level of knowledge of and exposure to investing varies widely
between countries and people.

Could linking green consumption patterns with sustainable investing
provide another pathway to speed up achieving climate justice as well as
personal financial goals?

In this simplified scenario, I'm in a physical offline store, doing some
shopping. When putting a bottle of Coca Cola in my basket, my AI
companion Susan will ask me a personalized question:

Does individual climate action help?

Gen-Z college students (target users) may not have the capital to make a
financial dent today however they can be early adopter and they will be
the decision-makers in a few years.

``Like climate change, the focus on individual actions as a solution is
often misplaced, though it remains a focus of media and industry. For
decades, the petrochemical industry has offloaded responsibility onto
individuals through promoting concepts such as the''carbon footprint'',
championed in a 2004 advertising campaign by British Petroleum'' \citep[

\subsection{Expert Surveys}\label{expert-surveys}

\subsection{Database}\label{database}

Compile a database on relevant apps and companies in the space

Easily access data used in this research project (please wait a bit
until it loads below). The database includes sustainability-focused apps
categorized by features and problems they try to solve, sustainable
investing apps, and links to research papers.

\subsection{User Survey}\label{user-survey}

Start with a simple but powerful question: --- Does it matter what you
buy? --- Does it matter how much you save? --- Does it matter where you
invest? Why?

\subsection{Research Limitations}\label{research-limitations}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  This work is focused on user experience design and does attempt to
  make a contribution to economics. Sacred Economics is use as-is as a
  framework and visualization tool.
\item
  First, finance is a highly regulated industry and the proposed user
  experience designs may be limited by legal requirements. This study
  does not take such limitations into account, rather focusing only on
  the user experience.
\item
  Finally, ESG needs data to give us an accurate understanding of the
  realities inside companies and the user experience design does not
  address the underlying data quality problem further than by providing
  a link to the data source.
\item
  Research Reason: While many people are working on AI models, there's a
  lack of people working on ``Human-AI interaction''. Sustainability is
  the context. How can we better team up to solve the challenges we face
  this century? The huge externalities.
\item
  I don't have access to user financial data.
\item
  ESG data is expensive so couldn't be used in this research.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future Research}\label{future-research}

The literature is rich and there is ample space for future research. The
following includes some suggestions for authors whose work deserves a

  Sustainability is fragmented. How can billions of people build closer
  relationships with sustainability-focused companies based on honesty
  and transparency? A research project for designing a sustainable

\item
  Most sustainability plans rely on carbon credits to achieve their
  goals, making carbon credits a single point of failure. If the credits
  are not accurate, the whole system collapses.

\section{Early Feature Ideas}\label{early-feature-ideas}

The following early prototypes are focused on particular feature ideas
that occurred to me during the literature review process. They are naive
and meant to allow thinking in terms of \emph{what-if} a particular user
experience was possible. These prototypes were not tested with users
directly and formed a basis for directing the questions asked in a
potential user survey.

\section{Susan (Sustainability
Conversation)}\label{susan-sustainability-conversation}

\emph{What if} I could have a chat like this at the supermarket? Imagine
what questions I would ask before buying a product. AI: ``Kris, do you
still remember Coca Cola's packaging is a large contributor to ocean
plastic? You even went to a beach cleanup!'' Me: ``That's so sad but
it's tasty!'' AI. ``Remember your values. Would you like to start saving
for investing in insect farms in Indonesia instead? Predicted return 4\%
per year, according to analysts A and B.'' If I'm not so sure, I could
continue the conversation. Me: ``Tell me more'' AI: ``A recent UN study
says, the planet needs to grow 70\% more food in the next 40 years.
Experts from 8 investment companies predict growth for this category of
assets.'' Me: ``Thanks for reminding me who I am'' \ldots{} Moments
later. AI: ``This shampoo is made by Unilever, which is implicated in
deforestation in Indonesia according to reporting by World Forest Watch.
Would you consider buying another brand instead? They have a higher ESG
rating.''

Example Suggestions of the AI companion:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  ``Don't buy a car, use a car sharing service instead to save XYZ CO2.
  Service available near you: Bolt,* Uber.''
\item
  ``Use a refillable shampoo bottle to save XYZ plastic pollution''
\item
  ``Call your local politician to nudge them to improve bicycle paths
  and reduce cars in your neighborhood. Over the past 2 years, you city
  has experienced an increase of cars from 290 cars per capita to 350
  cars per capita.''*
\end{itemize}

and a robo-advisor through the interface of chat messages in the context
of retail shopping for daily products.

\subsection{Sustainability Watch}\label{sustainability-watch}

\emph{What if} I could see all my sustainability data on a wearable

\subsection{Narrative Layouts}\label{narrative-layouts}

\emph{What if} I spent 5 minutes every day with a guide who could help
me make more eco-friendly choices? How should the layout storyline be
structured? Well it's like Strava (that running app) for
sustainability\ldots{} or if you have heard of Welltory. I believe
sustainable choices that would improve my life.. be it what I consume,
save, invest, etc.. so I'm trying to design an app around this idea. I'm
basically building the UX of AI.. focused on sustainability. How should

important? - anything else you see that you think looks special - do you
see anywhere you can click? - would you click on it? - if yes, continue
- if no, make note, and continue - explain: due to the limitation of the
prototype, the test will continue on a separate page where you can ask
questions - is there anything you would like to ask the helper? - notice
if the user picks from sample questions - remind the user they can come
up with their own question - as the ai is generating content ask: do you
see any information in this content - did you know this before or is
there any info you didn't know before? make note. - front page: explain
the helper takes into account your personal info and goals. - ask: what
kind of information do you think important to share with the helper?
