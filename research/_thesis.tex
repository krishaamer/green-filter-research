\section{Abstract}\label{abstract}

Taiwanese college students are concerned with environmental issues, yet
they are hindered by lack of simple tools to affect systemic change.
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Planet, strengthening environmental
policy from the European Union includes the concept of \emph{digital
product passports}, which aims to help distinguish \emph{eco-designed}
products made by \emph{circular economy} companies striving to be
zero-waste from companies that simply engage in \emph{greenwashing}.
Tracking product data from the source materials until the consumer
purchase and finally post-purchase recycling, combined with
\emph{data-driven interaction design} facilitates building transparency
into opaque global supply chains by using \emph{large-language models}
and \emph{artificial intelligence assistants} to translate complex
environmental data into human-comprehensible language.

The emerging field of \emph{planetary health} recognizes profound
interconnections between our economic behaviors, ecosystem services such
as clean water, air, soil, the climate crisis, and human health. As of
2024, Earth's natural environment is being heavily degraded by the
extractive business practices of companies that make many of the
products and services we buy every day. The way we use our money to
interact with companies - through shopping as consumers and saving /
investing as investors - has an effect on the life-supporting biosphere
we rely on to keep our planet inhabitable. In essence, from an
ecological perspective, every financial action is either an investment
decision to support more environmentally-friendly companies - or to
support polluters.

My research addresses the need for tools to make sustainable financial
action more convenient, focusing in particular on college students. I
leverage \emph{design research} to find design concepts for \emph{simple
AI-based user interfaces} also known as \emph{generative UIs} to help
young adults participate in \emph{sustainable financial activism}. A
survey of 700 students across 10 universities in Taiwan was conducted,
enhanced by 5 expert interviews providing industry insights. The major
contribution of the study is an interactive AI-assistant prototype.

\section{摘要}\label{ux6458ux8981}

大學生關注環境問題，但因學業繁忙及缺乏簡便工具來影響體制改變而受阻。歐盟更強化環保政策，引入了「數位產品護照」的概念，此舉有望幫助區分由循環經濟公司製造的、努力實現零廢棄的「生態設計」產品，與僅聲稱自己環保的公司。從原材料到消費者的產品數據追踪，結合「數據驅動的互動設計」，有助於為不透明系統建立透明度。同樣地，「大型語言模型」的發展使得「人工智能助理」能夠成為複雜環境數據與人類可理解語言之間的翻譯層。

新興的「地球健康」領域認識到我們的經濟行為、生態系統服務（如淨水、空氣、土壤）、氣候危機與人類健康之間存在深刻的相互聯繫。截至2024年，地球的自然環境正被開採性企業的商業行為嚴重破壞，這些企業生產我們每天購買的許多產品和服務。我們通過消費和儲蓄/投資與公司的互動方式，對我們賴以生存的、支持地球可居住生物圈產生影響。從生態學的角度看，每一個財務行動都是支持更環保公司的投資決策，或是支持污染者。

我的研究應對了為大學生提供便於實行可持續財務行動的工具需求。我專注於利用「設計研究」來尋找「簡易AI用戶介面」的設計概念，也稱為「生成UI」，以幫助大學生參與「可持續財務行動主義」。在台灣10所大學進行了一項涵蓋700名學生的調查，並增加了5位專家訪談以提供行業見解。研究的主要貢獻是一個互動AI助理原型。

關鍵詞：氣候焦慮、人工智能互動、數位可持續性、財務行動主義、透明度、地球健康。

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

How can college students find sustainable companies? Furthermore, if
given appropriate tools, could college students leverage their
purchasing power to reward sustainable companies?

My research describes the process of designing an AI companion for
college students to help with sustainable shopping, saving, and
investing.

Money spent shopping, saving, and investing in sustainable companies
serves as an incentive to adopt more sustainable practices. If used
wisely, money can reward companies for becoming more sustainable.

Encourage the least sustainable companies to improve their performance,
raising the overall baseline.

Facilitate the formation of communities centered around environmental
stewardship.

Build closer relationships with sustainability.

\subsection{Relevance}\label{relevance}

The research addresses the \textbf{\emph{``attitude-behavior gap''}}
among Taiwanese college students in taking sustainable financial action.

Convergence of the following 5 trends makes my research timely in 2024.

\subsection{Background}\label{background}

I grew up as an avid science fiction reader, which influenced my outlook
towards future possibilities. In particular, the Star Trek universe had
an imaginary portable device called a \textbf{\emph{tricorder}} (fig.~1)
enabling scientists to scan anything for insights. Be it precious
minerals inside a cave or scanning the human bodies for medical data,
its sensors would show up with some useful data. In daily life, I would
love to have such a device for consumer choices and financial decisions
- to know what to buy and which businesses to support with my money and
approval.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{./images/introduction/tricorder.jpg}

}

\caption{Captain Sulu using a Tricorder (Star Trek) - Photo copyright by
Paramount Pictures}

\end{figure}%

While a \emph{tricorder} is still science fiction, technological
advancements are getting closer and closer to producing something
similar. AIs are already integral to many parts of our lives, with
computer models producing increasingly useful outputs. The proposal for
this thesis was first written using Google's and Apple's voice
recognition software in 2020, and later switching to OpenAI's
\emph{Whisper} model, allowing me to transcribe notes with the help of
an AI assistant. As a foreigner living in Taiwan since 2019, I relied on
AI-based tools for many aspects of my life: speaking, moving, finding
food and services. When writing in Chinese, Apple's text prediction
algorithms translate pinyin to 漢字 and show the most likely character
based on my previous writing, Google's maps find efficient and
eco-friendly routes and recommend places to eat and ChatGPT provides
statistically probable advice from the sum of human knowledge. Even when
we don't realize it, AI is helping us with many mundane tasks. While it
takes incredibly complex computational algorithms to achieve all this in
the background, it's become so commonplace, we don't even think about
it. From this point of view, another AI assistant to help students with
choosing more eco-friendly businesses - to shop, save, and invest -
doesn't sound so much of a stretch.

\subsection{Motivation}\label{motivation}

Environmental degradation is increasingly affecting human lives - and
it's largely driven by manufacturing processes - of the products we
consume daily. From resource extraction in the linear economy (mining
raw materials and drilling for fossil fuels) to chemical processes
(causing contamination and pollution of the air, water, and soil) to
waste generation and greenhouse gas emissions, industries transform the
natural world into consumer products. While industry practices have
improved since the industrial revolution in the 19th century, and
continue to improve, it's possible to further improve standards of
production and raise the global baseline for sustainability, given
enough societal pressure to do so.

Nonetheless, without easily accessible and reliable data, it's difficult
to know which company is more sustainable than another. As consumers and
investors (even if only through passive ownership of savings), we don't
really know much about enterprise production practices, unless we spend
a lot of time looking at the numbers, which may be costly to access (for
example ESG reports are expensive), and mostly rely on our governments
and international bodies to keep us safe. Or just look at the brands
themselves - and pick the ones which we like.

\subsection{Objective}\label{objective}

The study presents design research for developing an AI companion to
help college students find sustainable companies for shopping, saving
and investing. The major contribution of my study is an interactive
artefact (a prototype) informed by design research.

\subsection{Literature Review}\label{literature-review}

\subsubsection{Goals}\label{goals}

Given the goal of designing an app to integrate sustainable shopping,
saving, and investing. The goal of the literature review is to find
insights about the target audience (Taiwanese college students),
understand what kind of sustainable actions are effective, and translate
these into specific ideas for app features. In order to keep track more
easily, each literature review chapter includes in-context \emph{design
implications}.

The literature review branches out to 5 main directions and maps out
relationships sources and the literature map, namely Taiwanese college
students, generation-z demographics, sustainability, ecology, ecosystem
services, EU legislation, sustainable finance, sustainable investing,
savings, circular economy, economics, AI, existing sustainability,
software, sustainability--related mobile apps (Apple iOS / Google
Android), and web apps related to sustainable shopping, savings, and
investing; apps using algorithmic interfaces (AI-based UI), design,
UX/UI, service design, sustainable design, speculative design,
interaction design, behavior change, nudge.

\section{Students}\label{students}

\subsection{Research Gap When it Comes to Taiwanese College
Students}\label{research-gap-when-it-comes-to-taiwanese-college-students}

There's lack of scientific research when it comes to Taiwanese college
students, not only in English or other foreign languages, but also in
Chinese. Much of the research in Taiwan focuses on younger students,
particularly those in primary and secondary schools. With regards to
issues related to college students and sustainability, even less
research is available. My project hopes to shed some light to how
Taiwanese college students relate to sustainability.

\subsection{Taiwan in the Global Context: Global and Local
Attitudes}\label{taiwan-in-the-global-context-global-and-local-attitudes}

(Kuo-Hua Chen, 2019) compares Taiwan to other countries in terms of
Postmaterialist Index Comparison, noting Taiwanese society is
materialistic.

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-4-output-1.pdf}}

World Values Survey

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-5-output-1.pdf}}

(Franzen \& Bahr, 2024) measures \emph{``mean environmental concern''}
to look at decade-level changes in societal environmental attitudes
across countries. Taiwan's general attitudes have stayed almost the same
(slight increase). The UK has had the largest jump in concern.
Curiously, South Korea has had a slight decrease in concern. Slovakia
and Russia were not very concerned with the environment a decade ago and
are even less concerned now.

A large-scale global study by (Anthony Leiserowitz et al., 2022)
administered on Meta's Facebook (n=108946) reported people in Spain
(65\%), Sweden (61\%), and Taiwan (60\%) believe \emph{``climate change
is mostly caused by human activities''.}

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-6-output-1.pdf}}

The largest study to date, conducted by the United Nations across 50
countries, surveying 1.2 million people, distributed through mobile game
ads, showed the majority of people agreeing climate change is an
\emph{``emergency''} (UNDP, 2021).

\end{longtable}

\subsection{Student Protests: In Taiwan vs Around the
World}\label{student-protests-in-taiwan-vs-around-the-world}

In August 2018, Swedish high-school student Greta Thunberg skipped class
to start a climate strike in front of the Swedish parliament Riksdag.
Millions of people around the world joined her \emph{Fridays for Future}
protests. Time magazine named Thunberg person of the year for
\emph{creating a global attitudinal shift.} (Deutsche Welle, 2019).

}

\caption{Climate protest in Geneva on 27th September, 2019 -- 1 year
after the start of Fridays for Future}

\end{figure}%

In Taiwan, the Fridays for Future protests were small in scale, with no
more than 100-200 people (Hioe, 2019). Meanwhile 2000 Taiwanese students
joined the initative by participating in environmental activities
without protesting

\end{figure}%

Meanwhile Indonesia, Philippines, have had larger protests.

The protest trend is subsiding.

McKinsey says people want eco-products but aren't willing to pay more.

Willingness too pay research.

\subsection{The Attitude-Behavior Gap}\label{the-attitude-behavior-gap}

While people express eco-conscious ideas, it's non-trivial to practice
sustainability in daily life. (Deyan Georgiev, 2023b) reports only 30\%
of people in the Gen-Z age group believe technology can solve all
problems.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  (Park \& Lin, 2020) positive attitude towards sustainable products
  does not result in purchase decisions, shows research of fashion in
  South Korea. In one Australian study, green consumers still waste food
  similarly to the baseline (McCarthy \& Liu, 2017).
\item
  Munro, Kapitan \& Wooliscroft (2023) shoppers trying to shop
  sustainably often fail to find sustainable products.
\item
  Marc Lien (2022) Four millions British SMEs have no plan for net-zero
  transition.
\item
  Ware (2024) British workers lack skills for green transition. (2024
  National Environmental Services Survey)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Taiwanese Education System and Policy
Environment}\label{taiwanese-education-system-and-policy-environment}

Taiwan has approximately 2 million young adults (Gen-Z, 18-26), and 73\%
percent of them are students attending tertiary education as of 2023,
with a slow increase of enrollment over the past decade (Ministry of
Education of Taiwan, 2024b).

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-7-output-1.pdf}}

As of 2024, Taiwan has a total of 148 universities, colleges, and junior
colleges (Ministry of Education of Taiwan, 2024c). Education funding is
4.26\% of Taiwan's GDP in 2023-24 and has been on a decline for a decade
(Ministry of Education of Taiwan, 2024a). Taiwan has an aging population
and declining birth rates have forced several schools to close down (Goh
et al., 2023; Davidson \& Chi-hui, 2024).

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-8-output-1.pdf}}

While the overall number of students is declining, the share of
international students is increasing.

\subsubsection{Confucianism}\label{confucianism}

Taiwanese culture is deeply influenced by Confucianism, valuing academic
excellence, effort, and the role of education in achieving social status
(Xu, 2024). Both Confucianism and Daoism affect education to be
\emph{teacher-centered}, where traditionally the role of students is to
listen and absorb knowledge; in today's society, there's space to open
opportunities for revisiting \emph{dialogue-based} education, where
students would be encouraged to take a more active role and gain
ownership of their education (Chang, Wegerif \& Hennessy, 2023).

\subsubsection{Sustainability Attitudes}\label{sustainability-attitudes}

In general, Taiwanese teachers at all levels of education have a
positive attitude towards sustainability.

At the pre-university level, Taiwanese government has been promoting
environmental education through a green school network; however surveys
at middle school and high school level suggest there is no impact on
\emph{sustainability consciousness} among students in comparison with
regular schools (Olsson et al., 2019). Rather, Taiwanese students are
influenced towards environmental action by \emph{group consciousness}
(Yu, Yu \& Chao, 2017). In contrast,(陳珮英, 2003) reports \emph{good
knowledge of sustainable development} topics among \emph{junior high
school students} in Da-an District, Taipei City (n=596). (林, 2009)
similarly reports a positive attitude and good knowledge of
environmental sustainable development among senior \emph{high school
students} towards in Taipei City (n=328). Several Taiwanese studies also
focus on the physical environment of school campuses, for example the
sustainability of elementary school campuses (潘智謙 \& Pan, 2006).
Elementary-school teachers in Taichung (n=536), have positive attitudes
towards environmental education are positive, proactive and demonstrate
high awareness; they have participated in many sustainability-related
workshops (Liao et al., 2022).

At the university level, (Chen \& Tsai, 2016) reports a \emph{positive
attitude yet moderate knowledge} about \emph{ocean sustainability} among
Taiwanese college students (n=825). (Liu et al., 2023a) studied
sustainability behavior of Taiwanese University students, reporting the
COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to prevalence of health issues, also
spurred more attention on environmental topics. In a similar vein, the
devastating nuclear disaster in Fukushima, Japan, after 2011 earthquake,
had an effect on Taiwanese energy and sustainability education (姚 \&
侯, 2011). Taiwanese government launched the Sustainable Council in 1997
to promote of environmental and sustainable development; a survey of
university-level teachers (n=100) in central Taiwan (Taichung, Changhua,
and Yunlin) shows a positive attitude toward environmental
sustainability among teachers however implementation of environmental
sustainability practices is from low to medium range (林 \& 莊, 2015).
Taiwanese government has also launched funding for University Social
Responsibility (USR) programs to train college students in social
innovation and local revitalization (Chen \& Chou, 2023; Liu et al.,
2022).

Comparing college students' education for sustainable development (ESD)
in Taiwan (n=617) and Sweden (n=583) found Sweden has a long history in
environmental education while in Taiwan environment became a focus area
with the 1998 educational reform (Berglund et al., 2020).

\subsubsection{Eco-Friendly Diet}\label{eco-friendly-diet}

An older study in 5 university in Taipei and Taichung (n=255) found
78.04\% of respondents consumed beef in the month prior and were
concerned with food safety, freshness, and quality (Hsu, Lu \& Chen,
2014). (Thiagarajah \& Kay, 2017) reports a general observation in their
abstract (I was unable to access the full study) that most college
students in all observed countries including Taiwan (n=534) regarded
``\emph{plant-based diets to have health benefits''}.

\subsection{The Effect of Climate Change on
Taiwan}\label{the-effect-of-climate-change-on-taiwan}

Taiwan has been affected by drought over 4 decades, rising temperatures
and altered rainfall patterns, impacting water security and
semiconductor manufacturing\hspace{0pt}(Vo \& Liou, 2024). Corals
surrounding Taiwan are affected by marine heatwaves, ocean acidification
and increased sea surface temperature affects coral bleaching level (Hsu
et al., 2024). Biomarkers in the sediment core around Taiwan are being
used to study variations in climate over past thousands of years (Wang
et al., 2021). Taiwan is affected by Kuroshio (黑潮) like Estonia is
affected by the Gulf Stream. Both oceanic currents help regulate the
climates of their respective regions and marine ecosystems. Kuroshio is
a warm current of the Pacific Ocean. Rossby planetary waves driven by
the Earth's rotation are crucial to keeping the atmosphere in balance by
helping transfer tropical heat towards Earth's poles and cold air toward
the tropics; interactions between oceanic currents, Rossby waves and
nonlinear \emph{mesoscale eddies,} which form complex undulations, and
their effect on the climate are still not well understood (US Department
of Commerce, n.d.; Belonenko, Sandalyuk \& Gnevyshev, 2023; Liu et al.,
2024; Lin et al., 2022b; Yin, Lin \& Hou, 2019; Mensah et al., 2014;
Shen et al., 2014). Around 33\% of Taiwanese CO2e emissions is captured
by the marine carbon sink, while the effect of forests in Taiwan needs
further study (Hung et al., 2024).

\subsection{Sustainability Tools in the Taiwanese
Context}\label{sustainability-tools-in-the-taiwanese-context}

Musical garbage truck are a success story of the environmental progress
in Taiwan (Helen Davidson \& Chi Hui Lin, 2022). Indeed, they are a
\emph{user interface innovation} and the main way how people in Taiwan
interact with sustainability issues.

The popular narrative about Taiwan recounts the story of the economic
and environmental transformation of the country. In the late 1980s
during the heights of an economic boom Taiwan became famous as the
Taiwanese Miracle (臺灣奇蹟) (Gold, 1986; Tsai, 1999). By the early
1990s another less flattering nickname appeared: ``garbage island'', for
the piles of trash covering the streets and overflowing landfills (Rapid
Transitions Alliance, 2019; Ngo, 2020). In the two decades that
followed, from 1998 to 2018, Taiwan made progress in municipal waste
management, rising to the status of a world-leader in recycling (2nd
\emph{effective recycling rate} after Germany); in addition to an
effective recycling system, the average waste amount generated per
person by 700g (from 1140g to 400g) per day; nonetheless, industrial
recycling rates were less stellar, standing at 80\% in 2020 and there
were unrealized opportunities in using industry 4.0 technologies, such
as internet of things (IoT) sensors for better waste tracking (Wu, Hu \&
Ni, 2021; Bui et al., 2023).

Progress in sustainability is possible but achieving results takes time
and innovation. (Rapid Transitions Alliance, 2019) credits the Taiwanese
Homemakers United Foundation (財團法人主婦聯盟環境保護基金會) for
initiating the transformation in 1987, suggesting a small group of
people can have an outsized impact on the whole country. Their activity
didn't stop there and (財團法人主婦聯盟環境保護基金會, 2020) recounts a
timeline of their achievements on their website until the present day.

\subsection{Trends in Taiwanese
Companies}\label{trends-in-taiwanese-companies}

Between 1970 and 2019 CO2 was a prerequisite of economic growth in
Taiwan (check this again) (Chang et al., 2023). Taiwan is a net CO2
exporter since 1990s through emissions embedded in the industrial
production oriented economy (Huang, Lv \& Li, 2020).

TIME Magazine and Statista collaborative \emph{``World's Most
Sustainable Companies Of 2024''} includes 17 Taiwanese companies (Alana
Semuels, 2024).

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In Japan, Gen-Z wants privacy and 75\% feel others overshare on social
  media and 49 percent were concerned about their personal data
  https://www.mckinsey.com/\textasciitilde/media/mckinsey/email/genz/2022/06/07/2022-06-07b.html
\item
  (Manchanda et al., 2023) survey (n=726) administered at shopping malls
  in New Delhi, India, found similar levels of sustainability
  consciousness between Millenial (n=206) and Generation-Z (n=360) age
  groups; people with high level of materialism were found to be less
  sustainability-conscious; the effect of mindfulness on sustainability
  was found to be stronger among females than males, supporting the
  hypothesis of the moderating effect of gender.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{There's evidence young people have money.} In the United States,
the combined annual consumer spending of Gen-Z and Millennials was over
2.5 Trillion USD in 2020 (YPulse, 2020). Over the decade from 2020 to
2030, in the U.S., UK, and Australia, Millennials are projected to
inherit 30 trillion USD from their parents (Calastone, 2020). There's
also some evidence of investment interest, however there's large
geographic variance. According to a (Calastone, 2020) study (n=3000)
surveying people in the millennial age group between ages 23 and 35 in
Europe (UK, France, Germany), U.S.A., Hong Kong, and Australia, 48\% of
respondents located in Hong Kong owned financial securities (such as
stocks) while the figure was just 10\% in France.

There is extensive research on the attitudes of U.S. college students
towards climate change. (American Press Institute, 2022) reports only
37\% percent of U.S. Generation-Z and Millenials follow news related to
environmental issues. (Schwartz et al., 2022) reports some adult US
students in a small study (18-35, n = 284) express feelings of
insignificance of their actions to achieve any meaningful impact.
(Thomaes et al., 2023) reports U.S. adolescents don't find
sustainability relevant to their daily life. (Ross et al., 2016) says
most people in the U.S. don't act on climate change. ``Action on climate
change has been compromised by uncertainty, aspects of human
psychology''.

\subsection{Pollution Levels}\label{pollution-levels}

Taiwanese college students are subjected to high levels of pollution.
University campuses are somewhat healthier than other areas. There are
several decades of research on pollution levels in Taiwan, most with
very scary correlations to health.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Taiwan air pollution, the worst (highest PM2.5 concentration) were
  found in Changhua (24.5 µg/m³), Tainan (20.9 µg/m³), and Pingtong
  (20.7 µg/m³) (Chang Hsiung-feng, Wu Che-hao \& Wu Kuan-hsien, 2024).
\end{itemize}

Religion plays a role in air pollution: Tang \& Pan (2014)

\subsection{Designing for College Students: Developing
Personas}\label{designing-for-college-students-developing-personas}

User research makes extensive use of user \emph{personas} to represent a
group of people with similar attributes. Designers use personas to
\emph{articulate assumptions,} which, if used well, is useful for
\emph{user-centered design}, to create better products. Personas help to
reflect on what kind of \emph{biases} might exist in the design. Within
the larger cohort of college students several different personas could
be defined, for example grouping people by interests, knowledge, habits,
levels of anxiety, and other attributes.

There have been concerns about food safety in Taiwan.

Humans have a long list of cognitive biases, which a good design should
take into account.

Students ride bicycles and scooters. Many circular economy service such
as YouBike and transport sharing platforms like Uber are available.

Many students live in dorms and shared housing, meaning their impact per
square meter is low.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Students in the Generation-Z age bracket (abbreviated as Gen-Z or
  Zoomers) are born between 1997 and 2012 (Branka Vuleta, 2023). Over
  98\% of Gen-Z owns a smartphone while only 80\% of the general world
  population does (Global Web Index, 2017; BankMyCell, 2022).
\item
  High levels of technology adoption worldwide
\item
  (Credit Suisse, 2022) suggests young consumers are more eco-friendly
  and drive the speed of change. Yet the Economist has ran a few
  anonymous articles calling gen-z green ideals into question (The
  Economist, 2023; Anon, 2023o).
\item
  Deyan Georgiev (2023a)
\item
  Alex Reice (2021)
\item
  (Wood, 2022) suggests in the U.S. Gen-Z is willing to pay 10\% more
  for ethically goods, spend 24\% more on sustainable products than
  Generation X and 75\% of Gen Z would prioritize sustainability over
  brand loyalty.
\end{itemize}

The above studies give foundation for creating a persona of a U.S.
College Student who doesn't follow environmental news and thinks climate
action doesn't make a difference. This doesn't necessarily mean this
group of people with similar ideas would deny climate change is
happening. Rather ``Climate Denier'' could be another persona, grouping
people into a cohort who thinks climate change is not real. Further
research would be needed to define relevant personas which have
meaningful predictive and generalizing power.

A large worldwide study (n=10000, age 16-25) by (Hickman et al., 2021)
provides evidence the youth is anxious about climate in Australia,
Brazil, Finland, France, India, Nigeria, Philippines, Portugal, the UK,
and the USA. Similarly, (Thompson, 2021) finds young people around the
world have climate anxiety. (Whitmarsh et al., 2022) shows worry about
the climate in the UK is generally widespread (over 40\% of the
respondents, n=1332), while climate anxiety is highest among young
people and is a possible motivator for climate action. Additionally,
(Ogunbode et al., 2022) finds climate anxiety in 32 countries and also
supports the idea that climate anxiety leads to climate activism.
(Thibodeau, 2022): ``In 2021, the BBC polled 1,000 people in Scotland to
understand the barriers to taking climate action. What they found was
even though many people were aware of actions needed to take to address
climate change, and had intentions to their behaviors didn't change.
This is a phenomenon called the intention-action gap.''

Humans working together are able to achieve more than single
individuals. ``Any community on the internet should be able to come

\subsection{The Roots of Sustainability in
Environmentalism}\label{the-roots-of-sustainability-in-environmentalism}

\emph{``Nachhaltigkeit''} - \emph{sustainability} in German - was likely
the first use of the concept of preserving natural resources, conceived
by a tax accountant Hannß Carl von Carlowitz in 1713 in his seminal book
on forestry - \emph{Sylvicultura oeconomica -}, referring to the goal of
achieving prudent forest management practices in his native Saxony in
Southeastern Germany, which at the time was under severe
\emph{deforestation} pressure from mining, ship-building and
agricultural production (Hannß Carl von Carlowitz, 1713; Gottschlich \&
Friedrich, 2014). This particular field of sustainability study is now
known as \emph{sustainable yield of natural capital}. The
\emph{principal} of the natural resource being managed, such as in
fishing and forestry, shouldn't be over-harvested in order to maintain
\textbf{\emph{ecosystem services}} - a contemporary term from the theory
of \emph{natural capital}, referring to benefits humans receive from the
stock of world's natural resources (Peter Kareiva et al., 2011).

Defining sustainability perhaps more poetically, the American wildlife
ecologist Aldo Leopold proposed the idea of \emph{land ethics} in 1972
as \emph{``{[}a{]} thing is right when it tends to preserve the
integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong
when it tends otherwise''} in his landmark work \emph{A Sand County
Almanac} (Leopold, 1972). In a similar vein, the 1987 United Nations'
Brundtland Report titled ``\emph{Our Common Future''} defined
\emph{sustainable development} as \emph{``Development that meets the
needs of the present without compromising the ability of future
generations to meet their own needs''} (Anon, 1987). Given these varied
ideas for over 300 years, I believe some percentage of people have been
concerned with our planet's natural environment and its preservation
already for centuries. Yet, it is only in the last 100 and so years that
human activities have begun to affect Earth's systems on a previously
unseen scale - termed \emph{Anthropocene} -, necessitating a deeper
understanding of human-nature interactions, such as in the case of
climate change, which is rapidly changing the face of our living
environments.

\subsection{Measuring, Visualizing Earth's
Climate}\label{measuring-visualizing-earths-climate}

Studies of Earth's climate go back for over 200 years, starting with
Alexander von Humboldt,the founder of climatology, who revolutionized
cartography by inventing the first \emph{isothermal maps} in 1816; these
maps showed areas with similar temperature, variations in altitude and
seasons in different colors (Honton, 2022) now available as 3D computer
models(Anon, 2023p). Already in 1896, the Nobel Prize winner Svante
Arrhenius first calculated how an increase in CO\textsubscript{2} levels
could have a warming effect on our global climate (Anderson, Hawkins \&
Jones, 2016; Wulff, 2020). In 1938, Guy Stewart Callendar was the first
scientist to demonstrate the warming of Earth's land surface as well as
linking the production of fossil fuels to increased CO\textsubscript{2}e
and changing climate (Hawkins \& Jones, 2013). Early scientists
pioneered climate modeling by calculating the first climate interactions
which precede today's complex computer-based \emph{Earth System Models
(ESMs)} that integrate the various Earth systems and cycles run on
supercomputers (Anderson, Hawkins \& Jones, 2016).

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{./images/sustainability/humboldt.jpg}

}

\caption{Humboldt's Naturgemälde, early data visualization of ecology,
rain, temperature, elevation, etc}

\end{figure}%

Environmental activists have been calling attention to global warming
for decades, yet the world has been slow to act (McKibben, 1989). While
the scientific case for human-induced climate change was building, it
took 120 years after Arrhenius' calculations, until the Paris Climate
Agreement in 2016, that countries came to an agreement on non-binding
targets on keeping CO\textsubscript{2} levels 1.5 °C below
pre-industrial levels (defined as 1850--1900)(United Nations, 2016).
Even though awareness of Earth's warming climate was growing ever
stronger, the CO\textsubscript{2} emissions kept rising too. The
hockey-stick growth of CO\textsubscript{2} concentration since the
industrial revolution is clear in the data from 1958 onward, following a
steady annual increase, called the \emph{Keeling Curve} (Keeling \&
Keeling, 2017). Written records of global temperature measurements are
available starting from the 1880s, when temperatures began to be
documented in ship logs (Brohan et al., 2012). Finally, although perhaps
less accurately, temperature estimations from tree-trunks allow some
comparisons with the climate as far back as 2000 years ago (Rubino et
al., 2019).

\end{figure}%

The latest data from 2023 shows our current world population of 8
Billion people emitted 37.2 gigatonnes (i.e.~billion metric tons) of
CO\textsubscript{2}e per year, the highest emissions recorded in history
(Statista, 2023a). In order to limit global warming to 1.5 °C as agreed
by the world nations in Paris, removal of 5-20 gigatons of
CO\textsubscript{2}e per year would be needed according to reduction
pathways calculated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) (Wade et al., 2023). Yet, most countries are missing the mark
(Climate Analytics \& NewClimate Institute, 2023; United Nations
Environment Programme, 2023). The European Union's Copernicus Climate
Change Service (C3S) reports 1.5 °C global warming has already been
breached in 2024 temperatures (Anon, 2024i; Anon, 2024c). Given the
current pace of climate change action, the G7 countries (Canada, France,
Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, United States) are heading for
2.7 °C of warming by 2050 (CDP, 2022).

Earth's physical systems are very sensitive to small changes in
temperature, which was not understood until the 1970s(McKibben, 2006). A
comprehensive review of evidence from paleoclimate records until current
time, including ocean, atmosphere, and land surface of points towards
substantial climate change if high levels of greenhouse gas emissions
continue, termed by the authors as \emph{climate sensitivity} (Sherwood
et al., 2020). Global warming may lead to the slowing down and complete
stop of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) which
helps maintain climate stability (Ditlevsen \& Ditlevsen, 2023).

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Measuring CO\textsubscript{2}e
Emissions}{Measuring CO2e Emissions}}\label{measuring-co2e-emissions}

Technology improves and measurements have become more accurate yet
CO\textsubscript{2}e emissions are not yet completely accounted for.
(Crippa et al., 2020) reports the latest figures CO\textsubscript{2}e
from the EU's Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research
(EDGAR). The EU Copernicus satellite system reveals new greenhouse
emissions previously undetected (Daniel Värjö, 2022). \emph{Copernicus

\emph{Scoping} CO\textsubscript{2e} \emph{emissions} into 4 main
categories helps to organize calculating CO\textsubscript{2e} emissions
and corresponding reduction targets by looking at direct and indirect
emissions separately. The U.S. National Public Utilities Council (NPUC)
decarbonization report provides a useful categorization of
\emph{emission scopes} applicable to companies which helps organizing
emission reduction schemes (National Public Utilities Council, 2022)
based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol defined in the 1990s (GHG Protocol,
n.d.). For example, for consumers in Australian states and territories
in 2018, 83\% of the GHG emissions are Scope 3, meaning indirect
emissions in the value chain (Goodwin et al., 2023). A newer concept is
Scope 4 emissions also known as avoided emissions, proposed by the World
Resources Institute (WRI) in 2013 (Plan A, n.d.).

Fossil fuels are what powers humanity as well as the largest source of
CO\textsubscript{2} emissions. IEA (2022) reports ``Global
CO\textsubscript{2} emissions from energy combustion and industrial
processes rebounded in 2021 to reach their highest ever annual level. A
6\% increase from 2020 pushed emissions to 36.3 gigatonnes''. As on June
2023, fossil fuel based energy makes up 82\% of energy and is still
growing Institute (2023). The 425 largest fossil fuel projects represent
a total of over 1 gigatons in CO\textsubscript{2} emissions, 40\% of
which were new projects Kühne et al. (2022). Tilsted et al. (2023)
expects the fossil fuel industry to continue grow even faster. In July
2023, the U.K. granted hundreds of new oil and gas of project licenses
in the North Sea (Anon, 2023z).

\subsubsection{Markets for Ecosystem Assets: Pricing, Tracing and
Trading}\label{markets-for-ecosystem-assets-pricing-tracing-and-trading}

Markets for ecosystems assets are centered around \emph{carbon credits},
a type of nature-backed financial derivative dependent on science-based
methodologies for measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV), which
are managed and regularly updated by certification organizations such as
Gold Standard, Verra, and others.

CO\textsubscript{2e} assigning a monetary value to carbon emissions.

Trading CO\textsubscript{2e} emissions can be divided into 2 categories
- \emph{Compliance Carbon Markets} (CCM) and \emph{Voluntary Carbon
Markets} (VCM).

The legislative baseline for Compliance Carbon Markets is so low, people
want to retire more CO\textsubscript{2e}, which they can do through
\emph{Voluntary Carbon Markets.}

For the individual person, there's no direct access to
CO\textsubscript{2} markets. However, brokers do buy large amounts of
carbon credits to resell in smaller quantities to retail investors.

\emph{``Carbon pricing is not there to punish people,''} says Lion Hirth
Lion Hirth (n.d.). \emph{``It's there to remind us, when we take travel,
heating, consumption decisions that the true cost of fossil fuels
comprises not only mining and processing, but also the damage done by
the CO\textsubscript{2} they release.''}

\emph{Long term cost} of insufficient climate action is more than
\emph{short-term gains} from delaying efforts to reduce carbon
emissions.

\begin{itemize}
\item

  including Chinese, European, and North American CO\textsubscript{2}

\item
  \emph{The price of} CO\textsubscript{2e} \emph{differs across
  markets.} (Stern, 2022b) argues carbon-neutral economy needs higher
  CO\textsubscript{2e} prices and believes (Rennert et al., 2022)
  CO\textsubscript{2e} price per ton should be 3,6x higher that it is
  currently. Contrary, (Ritz, 2022) argues optimal CO\textsubscript{2}
  prices could be highly asymmetric, low in some countries and high
  (above the social cost of CO\textsubscript{2e}) in countries where
  production is very polluting.

population is responsible for nearly half of all emissions, half of the
population emits less than 12\%''.

main drivers of climate change and environmental destruction, with
\emph{``2/3 of global GHG emissions are directly and indirectly linked
to household consumption, with a global average of about 6 tonnes
CO\textsubscript{2} equivalent per capita''} , according to (Renee Cho,
2020; Ivanova et al., 2020). An older study put the number as high as
60\% percent (Ivanova et al., 2016) while (Ellen MacArthur Foundation,
Material Economics, 2019)'s models 45\% show of CO\textsubscript{2}
equivalent emissions come from our shopping; produced by companies to
make the products we consume.

With the trend of urbanization, it's not surprising (people living in)
cities are responsible for 80\% of the emissions (Rosales Carreón \&
Worrell, 2018). (Moberg et al., 2019) reports daily human activities
emission contribution on average in four European countries (France,
Germany, Norway and Sweden).

Earth's growing population reached 8 Billion people In November 2022 and
population projections by predict 8.5B people by 2030 and 9.7B by 2050
(The Economic Times, 2022; United Nations Department of Economic and
Social Affairs, Population Division, 2022). Indeed, making
\emph{anything} consumes natural resources, which are limited on planet
Earth. (Hassoun et al., 2023) forecasts increase of global food demand
by 62\% driven by the impact of climate change. Yet, while population
growth puts higher pressure on Earth's resources, some researchers
propose the effect is higher from wasteful lifestyles than the raw
number of people (Cardinale et al., 2012). Meanwhile others, such as
(Cafaro, Hansson \& Götmark, 2022), believe \emph{{[}o{]}verpopulation
is a major cause of biodiversity loss and smaller human populations are
necessary to preserve what is left.''}

While the numbers on overconsumption are clear, the debate on
overconsumption is so polarized, it's difficult to have a meaningful
discussion of the topic (Ianole \& Cornescu, 2013). Environmental risks
from human activities are known as Anthropogenic Threat Complexes (ATCs)
(Bowler et al., 2020)\emph{.} As long as humanity is a mono-planetary
species, we have to come to terms with the limitations of our home,
Earth.

\paragraph{Plastic Pollution}\label{plastic-pollution}

Overconsumption is also one of the root causes of plastic pollution.
(Ford et al., 2022) and (Lavers, Bond \& Rolsky, 2022) find strong links
between climate change and marine plastic pollution \emph{``along with
other stressors that threaten the resilience of species and habitats
sensitive to both climate change and plastic pollution''}.

Plastic pollution is pervasive around the Earth and is fundamentally
linked to climate change, while microplastics are increasingly a real
concern (Tiernan et al., 2022; Lavers, Bond \& Rolsky, 2022). Several
international studies report recent findings of microplastics everywhere
in human bodies: the brain, lungs, digestive tissues, bone marrow,
penis, testis, seminal fluid (semen), and placenta - causing serious
health and reproductive concerns (Main, 2024; Guo et al., 2024; Hu et
al., 2024; Codrington et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024; Montano et al.,

In addition to the enormity of over-reaching CO\textsubscript{2}
emissions, humanity is facing other massive environmental problems. The
Stockholm Resilience Centre reports we have already breached 4 out of
our 9 \emph{``planetary boundaries'':} in addition to climate change,
biodiversity loss (Extinctions per Million Species per Year aka E/MSY),
land-system change (deforestation, land degradation, etc), and
biogeochemical flows (cycles of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, etc); on a
positive side, the challenges of fresh water use, ocean acidification
and stratospheric ozone depletion are still within planetary limits
(Persson et al., 2022).

In 1948, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) was
founded, which in

LULUCF ``Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry'' can both be a source
of greenhouse gas emissions - or a carbon sink (removing CO2 from the
atmosphere).

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Earth System Law, Planetary Health, and
Social Cost of
CO\textsubscript{2}}{Earth System Law, Planetary Health, and Social Cost of CO2}}\label{earth-system-law-planetary-health-and-social-cost-of-co2}

\emph{Planetary Health}, \emph{Earth System Law, and} Social Cost of
Carbon are 3 approaches to address the complex interdependence of humans
with our physical environment.

Scientists in cross-disciplinary teams have been working on integrating
Earth systems and human society into cohesive frameworks.

Evolving Measurements from Planetary Boundaries to Planetary Health

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Planetary health (Planetary Health Alliance, 2024a, 2024b)
\item
  Wardani et al. (2023) \emph{``long-term human well-being is dependent
  on the well-being of the planet, including both biotic and abiotic
  systems. It recognizes interlinkages across environmental
  sustainability, public health, and socioeconomic development.''}
\end{itemize}

\emph{Earth System Law} is a framework for addressing interconnected
environmental challenges (Du Toit \& Kotzé, 2022).

\emph{Social Cost of Carbon} attempts to measures the compound impact of
CO\textsubscript{2e} emissions on society. Sustainability is filled with
complexities. CO\textsubscript{2e} emissions are complicated by
biodiversity loss, child labor, slavery, poverty, chemical pollution,
etc. - many issues become intertwined (TEDx Talks, 2020). One attempt to
measure these complexities, is the \emph{Social Cost of Carbon} (SCC)
which is defined as \emph{``additional damage caused by an extra unit of
emissions''} (Kornek et al., 2021; Zhen, Tian \& Ye, 2018). For example
the cost of damages caused by ``one extra ton of carbon dioxide
emissions'' (Stanford University, 2021). SCC variations exist between
countries (Tol, 2019) and regions (Wang, Ma \& Wang, 2022).

\begin{itemize}
\item
\item
  (Lin et al., 2022a) says, apart from CO\textsubscript{2}, reduction of
  other atmospheric pollutants, such as non-CO\textsubscript{2}
  greenhouse gases (GHGs) and short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) is
  required for climate stability.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ecosystem Services: Quantifying Human Benefits from
Nature}\label{ecosystem-services-quantifying-human-benefits-from-nature}

\emph{Ecosystem services measure the benefits humans receive from the
biosphere.} Put most simply, \emph{ecosystem services} enable human life
on Earth. While it can be assumed much of the flora and fauna are
crucial for Earth's systems, science is still in the process of
understanding and quantifying its contributions. The history of the
valuation of nature's services goes back to the 18th century when David
Ricardo and Jean Baptiste Say discussed nature's \emph{work}, however
both considered it should be free (Gómez-Baggethun et al., 2010). In
1997 (Anon, 1997) proposed the idea of \emph{ecosystem services} and
(Costanza et al., 1997) attempted to assess the amount of ecosystem
services provided. (Le Provost et al., 2022)'s study shows
\emph{biodiversity} as one key factor to maintain delivery of ecosystem
services. (Noriega et al., 2018) attempts to quantify the ecosystem
services (ES) provided by insects.

The most complex computer models which attempt to capture ever more
interactions happening in the physical realm are called \emph{digital
twins.} The EU is developing a digital twin of Earth to help
sustainability prediction and planning, integrating Earth's various
systems such as climate, hydrology, ecology, etc, into a single model
Anon (2023f). We can use all the data being recorded to provide a
digital twin of the planet, nature, ecosystems and human actions to help
us change our behavior and optimize for planetary wellbeing.

\subsubsection{Biosphere}\label{biosphere}

Earth's biosphere is made up of 846 terrestrial ecoregions, which are
distributed across 14 major biomes and 8 biogeographical realms
(Dinerstein et al., 2017).

\subsubsection{Ecological Indicators}\label{ecological-indicators}

Sustainability can be measured using a variety of \emph{ecological
indicators}.

Ecological indicators for Earth \emph{- I would like to coin the word
``ecomarkers'' -} are like \emph{biomarkers} in human health.

Technological advances help scientist better understand nature. Cutting
edge research uses AI-based voice recognition for listening to nature,
assessing biodiversity based on species' sounds in the forest. Millions
of detections of different species with machine learning passive
acoustic AI models, can also assess species' response to climate change
(AI for Good, 2023; Guerrero et al., 2023).

\emph{Environmental DNA (eDNA)} helps scientists measure species
abundance without direct observation through detection of DNA on genetic
materials such as skin cells (Peter Andrey Smitharchive page, 2024).
Cellular DNA can be isolated from various sediment types (Ogram, Sayler
\& Barkay, 1987). Beyond scientific applications, eDNa is being used to
generate biodiversity credits by environmental asset rating companies
such as BeZero (Ojoatre \& Atkinson, 2023).

AI is being used to map icebergs and measure the change in size
(European Space Agency, 2023).

\subsubsection{Biodiversity}\label{biodiversity}

Why Protect Biodiversity?

(May, 2011) argues biodiversity loss is a concern for 3 points of views:

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Measuring Environmental Degradation}

(Almond, R.E.A. et al., 2022) reported, the number of species killed,
mass destruction of nature. ``69\% decline in the relative abundance of
monitored wildlife populations around the world between 1970 and 2018.
Latin America shows the greatest regional decline in average population
abundance (94\%), while freshwater species populations have seen the
greatest overall global decline (83\%).''

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-19-output-1.pdf}}

Biodiversity loss is linked to overconsumption, weak legislation and
lack of oversight. (Crenna, Sinkko \& Sala, 2019) recounts European
Union consumers' negative impact on biodiversity in countries where it
imports food. WWF (2022) case study highlights how 4 biodiverse regions
Cerrado in Brazil, Chaco in Argentina, Sumatra in Indonesia, and the
Cuvette Centrale in Democratic Republic of Congo are experiencing rapid
destruction due to consumer demand in the European Union. While the
European Union (EU) has recently become a leader in sustainability
legislation, biodiversity protection measures among private companies is
very low Marco-Fondevila \& Álvarez-Etxeberría (2023).

Meanwhile, there is some progress in biodiversity conservation as
``{[}*b{]}iodiversity awareness is now at 72\% or higher in all
countries sampled, compared to only 29\% or higher across countries
sampled in 2009''* (UEBT, 2022)

\textbf{Convention on Biodiversity}

Similarly to climate protection, the UN has taken a leadership role in
biodiversity protection. Unit (2023): The history of the United Nations
Convention on Biodiversity goes back to 1988, when the working group was
founded. UNEP (Tue, 12/20/2022 - 07:44): The Convention on Biodiversity
2022 (COP15) adopted the first global biodiversity framework to
accompany climate goals.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Forest}\label{forest}

Forests are a crucial part of Earth's carbon cycle and the main natural
CO\textsubscript{2} capture system; due to deforestation, Europe rapidly
losing its forest carbon sink (Frédéric Simon, 2022). Around 27\% of
Earth's land area is still covered by forests yet \emph{deforestation}
is widespread all around the world; highest rates of deforestation
happened in the tropical rainforests of South America and Africa, mainly
caused by agricultural cropland expansion (50\% of all deforestation)
and grazing land for farm animals to produce meat (38,5\%), totaling
close to 90\% of global deforestation (Anon, 2022f). The global forest
cover change is visible on Google's Earth Engine (Hansen et al., 2013).

Around the world, there are many initiatives to increase forest cover,
for example the \emph{1 billion tree project} (Greenfield \&
@pgreenfielduk, 2021; Anon, 2020; Bastin et al., 2019). However, it's
important to not planting trees (\emph{afforestation)} is not the full
solution, as \emph{afforestation} is different from
\emph{reforestation}, which takes into account biodiversity. Also, while
using remote-sensing and machine-learning to assess reforestation
potential (see Klosterman et al., 2022), it doesn't take into account
local political realities.

\begin{itemize}

\item
  Burning of biomass undermines carbon capture.

\subsubsection{Pollution}\label{pollution}

Health and sustainability are inextricably linked. ``Human health is
central to all sustainability efforts.'', \emph{``All of these (food,
housing, power, and health care), and the~stress~that the lack of them
generate, play a huge role in our health''} (Sarah Ludwig Rausch \& Neha
Pathak, 2021).

\emph{Design Implications} Start with the most polluted regigons as
priority?

\textbf{Air Pollution}

Clean air is a proposed as a \emph{human right} (Baroness Jones of
Moulsecoomb \& Caroline Lucas, 2023) yet air pollution is widespread
around the planet, with 99\% of Earth's human population being affected
by bad air quality that does not meet WHO air quality guidelines,
leading to health problems linked to 6.7 million \emph{premature deaths}
every year (World Health Organization, 2022).

Air pollution is linked to cancer incidence. In Taiwan, South Korea, and
England, groundbreaking research by (Lim et al., 2022) analyzed over
400000 individuals establishes exposure to 2.5μm PM (PM2.5) air
pollution as a \emph{cause for lung cancer.} In (Hannah Devlin, 2022),
professor Tony Mok, of the Chinese University of Hong Kong: \emph{``We
have known about the link between pollution and lung cancer for a long
time, and we now have a possible explanation for it. As consumption of
fossil fuels goes hand in hand with pollution and carbon emissions, we
have a strong mandate for tackling these issues -- for both
environmental and health reasons.''}

The main way to combat air pollution is through policy interventions.
(MARIA LUÍS FERNANDES, 2023) the EU has legislation in progress to curb
industrial emissions. If legislation is in place, causing bad air
quality can become bad for business. In China, (Gu et al., 2023) links
air pollution to credit interest rates for business loans; companies
with low environmental awareness and a history of environmental
penalties pay 12 percent higher interest rates. In France, (Bouscasse et
al., 2022) finds strong health and economic benefits across the board
from air pollution reduction.

\textbf{Water Pollution}

Globally, 4.4 billion people only have access to water that's not safe
for drinking (Soliman, 2024).

\subsubsection{Ready for Disaster}\label{ready-for-disaster}

The Word Economic Forums Global Risks Report 2024 paints a bleak picture
of the future with expectations of increased turbulence across the board
based on a survey of over 1400 topic experts (World Economic Forum,
n.d.).

\subsubsection{Weather}\label{weather}

Global warming increases the risk of disasters and extreme weather
events.

(Anon, 2023i) The US Global Change Research Program presented a
comprehensive report to the US Congress, which links disaster-risk
directly to global warming; for examples increased wildfires damage
property, endanger life and reduces \emph{air quality,} which in effect
increases health challenges. As extreme temperatures are increasingly
commonplace, with observed changes in heatwaves, there's increased risk
of wildfires (Volkova, Roxburgh \& Weston, 2021; Perkins-Kirkpatrick \&
Green, 2023), while flood risk mapping might lower property prices in at
risk areas (Sherren, 2024). Summers of 2022 and 2023 were the hottest on
record so far, with extreme heat waves recorded in places around the
world (Venturelli et al., 2023; Serrano-Notivoli et al., 2023; Douglas,
2023; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), U.S.
Department of Commerce, 2023; NOAA National Centers for Environmental
Information, 2023; Falconer, 2023).

The part of Earth where the \emph{human climate niche} is becoming
smaller (McKibben, 2023). As temperatures rise, certain cities may
become uninhabitable for humans (CBC Radio, 2021). The summer of 2023
saw extensive wildfires in Spain, Canada, and elsewhere; rapidly moving
fires destroyed the whole city of Lāhainā in Hawaii {[}ADD CITATION{]}.
In California, (Jerrett, Jina \& Marlier, 2022) says,
\emph{``{[}w{]}ildfires are the second most important source of
emissions in 2020''} and \emph{``negate reductions in greenhouse gas
emissions from other sectors.''} Some parts of South America have seen
summer heat \emph{in the winter}, with heatwaves with temperatures as
high as 38 degrees (Livingston, 2023).

In Taiwan disaster risk and hazard mapping is well-developed, with early
warning systems, and comprehensive response preparedness - and painful
experiences - instrumental to saving lives (Tsai et al., 2021).
Intensifying storms forming near coastlines, can be expected with
\emph{``{[}c{]}hanges to tropical cyclone trajectories in Southeast Asia
under a warming climate''} (Garner et al., 2024). The situation on the
Pacific and Atlantic oceans is not dissimilar, with
\emph{``{[}o{]}bserved increases in North Atlantic tropical cyclone peak
intensification rates''} (Garner, 2023).

In the Phillipines, with increasing extreme weather events,
\emph{``businesses are more likely to emerge in areas where
infrastructure is resilient to climate hazards''} (Cheng \& Han, 2022).

Climate-related disasters can spur action as extreme weather becomes
visible to everyone. After large floods in South Korea in July 2023 with
many victims, president Joon promised to begin taking global warming
seriously and steer the country towards climate action (Web, 2023; AFP,
2023; Al Jazeera, 2023). South Korea has a partnership with the European
Union (European Commission, 2023a).

\subsubsection{Individual Action}\label{individual-action}

Sometimes individual environmental (climate) action \emph{does matter}
and can come at great personal cost, even loss of life. EJAtlas tracks
environmental justice cases around the world, where human stakes are
very high Scheidel et al. (2020).

However, for most of us individual climate action is \emph{ineffective}.
The effect of individual climate action such as \emph{choosing a more
sustainable product} is so limited to be next to meaningless. For
individual consumer choices to make a difference, they need to be
\emph{aggregated} into a movement, collective action with scale,
influence, and visibility.

There is no single solution to the environmental crisis. Given the
enormity of environmental degradation, many different approaches are
needed. This chapter documents some of the ongoing work which a
sustainability companion could assist college students get involved
with.

Geopolitical situations can affect technology adoption; after Russia's
war in Ukraine, Europe needed to quickly reduce consuming cheap Russan
fossil fuel energy (in the form of gas) (Bonasia, 2024). In 2024, for
first time in Europe, renewables in the form of wind and solar energy
surged past production of fossil fuels (Graham \& Fulghum, 2024; Beer,
2024)

``Climatech'', Renewable Energy and Transforming Energy Production

Large technology conglomerates and newly founded startups working in
climate solutions space (often referred to as \emph{climatech} by the
media) have proposed a range of approaches to CO\textsubscript{2}
reduction in Earth's atmosphere. These technologies include several
types of \emph{carbon capture}, directly from the air (direct air
capture or DAC), from the source of pollution, such as using
high--performance filters on factory chimneys, as well as nature-based
solutions such as large scale tree planting using drones.

Each technology has their own pros and cons. (Vitillo et al., 2022)
illustrates how direct air capture of CO\textsubscript{2} is difficult
because of low concentration and CO\textsubscript{2} capture at the
source of the emissions is more feasible.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  (Gaure \& Golombek, 2022) simulate a CO\textsubscript{2} free
  electricity generation system in the European Union where ``98\% of
  total electricity production is generated by wind power and solar; the
  remainder is covered by a backup technology.''. The authors stipulate
  it's possible to power the EU without producing CO\textsubscript{2}
  emissions.

\subsection{Eco-Design: The Legislative
Perspective}\label{eco-design-the-legislative-perspective}

In Europe, \emph{eco-design} has strong political support as part of the
European Union's (EU) \emph{``Green Deal''} legislative strategy, aiming
to transform European economies into sustainability leaders. A large
part of the proposal by (Commission et al., 2014) is \emph{eco-design},
as a large part of product lifecycle environmental impact is defined in
the design process. The Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation
(ESPR) entered into force in the EU on July 18, 2024 (European
Commission, 2024) following the (European Parliament, 2022) proposal
whereby the European Commission established a general framework for
\emph{eco-design: ``requirements for sustainable products, repealing
rules {[}referring to the previous Eco-Design Directive (2009/125/EC){]}
currently in force which concentrate on energy-related products only,''}
setting up a level playing-field for the organizations operating on the
EU single market. Virginijus Sinkevičius, the EU Commissioner for the
Environment, Oceans and Fisheries, is quoted describing eco-design as
design that \emph{``respects the boundaries of our planet''} (European
Commission, 2022c).

It's not that the EU didn't have an environmental policy before, it's
that it was too vague and filled with loop-holes. CSRD (Corporate
Sustainability Reporting Directive) replaces NFRD (Non-Financial
Reporting Directive). ESRS reporting is a standard to meet CSRD
requirements.

The EU is also concerned with supply-chain deforestation. Sustainable
Products and EUDR (European Union Deforestation Regulation) work
hand-in-hand as part of EU's legislative efforts to promote
sustainability. EUDR applies to all products placed on the market from
30 December 2024 and 30 June 2025 for small businesses.

The EU ``Green Deal'' legislative strategy is comprehensive. Eco-Design
is a Key EU Sustainable Policy Design Tool.

Europe is transforming into a hotbed of sustainability. One of the EU
goals is reducing careless consumption. Tacking our consumption habits
can help support eco-designed products. It's up to legislators to
provide sustainable products on our marketplace\ldots{} but until this
happens, we can use the green filter.

The 9 qualities of \emph{eco-designed products} include

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lll@{}}

\end{longtable}

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-27-output-1.pdf}}

Europe is not the only region undertaking legislative efforts to promote
sustainability. In the US, the \emph{Inflation Reduction Act} provides
funding to development of decarbonizing technologies and includes plans
to combat air pollution, reduce green house gases and address
environmental injustices (Rajagopalan \& Landrigan, 2023). Many other
jurisdictions also have laws that aim to reduce the environmental impact
of products throughout their life cycles. For instance Australia has a
Product Stewardship (PS) scheme, which also includes an investment fund
targeted at increasing the recycling rates of specific products
(Australian Government, 2024). Australia, Japan, and Taiwan all have
Sustainable Procurement schemes prioritizing greener products in public
purchases {[}ADD CITATION{]}. While Taiwan doesn't yet have a specific
eco-design law, there are various pieces of legislation promoting
circular economy {[}ADD CITATION{]}. Already in 1988 Taiwan implemented
an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme, followed by a
recycling system (initially focused on electronic items) in 1998 (Chong
et al., 2009). Eco-design initiatives in Taiwan started at least as
early as 1994, when Taiwanese companies and universities noticed
international sustainability trends and began to implement their own
sustainable design initiatives (Jahau Lewis Chen et al., 2005).

The key to comparing Product Stewardship, Extended Producer
Responsibility (EPR), and Eco-Design is the scope, as illustrated in the
chart above. While Product Stewardship (PS) and Extended Producer
Responsibility (EPR) deal mostly with the end of the product lifecycle
(they are \emph{reactive}), including their disposal and recycling (EPR
going a step further than PS by shifting the responsibility to the
producer), Eco-Design moves sustainability up the design chain (being
\emph{pro-active}), setting standards for making better products - in
essence, attempting to \emph{design-out} the waste.

\subsection{Design is Political
Action}\label{design-is-political-action}

Design \emph{is} political.

I was torn whether to place \emph{politics} under \emph{sustainability}
or \emph{design}, and decided for the latter - as sustainability is
mostly \emph{descriptive}, using science to measure and present the real
situation, while design is \emph{prescriptive}: codifying decisions
about how do we live - in products and services.

Politics matters in sustainability. In Brazil, deforestation fell 60\%
in 1 year, based on remote satellite reconnaissance, after the election
of a more pro-environment leadership (Watts, 2023).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Pater (2021)
\item
  10 countries use almost 100\% renewable energy
\end{itemize}

There's ample evidence from several countries suggesting moving to
renewal energy brings environmental benefits:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Amin et al. (2022) suggests ``removing fossil fuel subsidies and
  intra-sectoral electricity price distortions coupled with carbon taxes
  provides the highest benefits'' for both the economy and the
  environment in Bangladesh.
\item
  Luo et al. (2022) suggests using reinforcement learning to reduce
  energy use in cooling systems.
\item
  Montreal protocol eradicates CfCs and the ozone holes became whole
  again.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\emph{Mitigating}} \textbf{Climate Change}

The monumental task of removing several gigatons of CO\textsubscript{2}
from the atmosphere requires massive policy shifts and collaboration
across countries and industries (Mackler, Fishman \& Broberg, 2021).

Warming global climate has concrete effects on daily life. Warmer
climate helps viruses and fungi spread (Press, 2023). (Williams \&
Joshi, 2013) higher CO\textsubscript{2} concentrations in the air can
cause more turbulence for flights.

\textbf{\emph{Adapting}} \textbf{to Climate Change}

Many companies are developing technologies for mitigation.

In the European Union (EU), a wide range of legislative proposals,
targets, organizations, and goals already exists across diverse
countries. Upcoming laws aim to harmonize approaches to sustainability
and raise standards for all members states, in turn influencing
producers who wish to sell in the EU common market.

have unforeseen ramifications. For example (Nuez, Ruiz-García \& Osorio,

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In 2019 by the von der Leyen commission adopted the European Union
  (EU) Green Deal strategy.
\item
  In 2021 the Commision proposed a goal of reducing CO2e emissions by
  55\% by 2030 under the \emph{Fit for 55} policy package consisting of
  a wide range of economic measures.
\item
  In November 2022, the proposal was adopted by the EU Council and EU
  Parliament with an updated goal of 57\% of CO2e reductions compared to
  1990. This proposal is set to become a binding law for all EU member
  countries (European Commission (2019c); European Commission (2019a);
  Anon (2022d); European Council (2022)).
\item
  In March 2022, the EU Circular Economy Action Plan was adopted,
  looking to make sustainable products \emph{the norm} in EU and
  \emph{empowering consumers} as described in European Commission
  (2022a). Each product covered by the policy is required to have a
  \textbf{\emph{Digital Product Passport}} which enables improved
  processing within the supply chain and includes detailed information
  to empower consumers to understand the environmental footprint of
  their purchases. It's safe to say the large majority of products
  available today do not meet these criteria.

\subsection{Design with Open Data}\label{design-with-open-data}

Open data is needed for civic engagement. Sharing vs Privacy is a
political question. Privacy and data-sharing are not in opposition.
Sustainability needs to be balanced with privacy. (Sanchez et al., 2022)
suggests tracking users using their smartphones and attributing points
for actions deemed beneficial yet this has potentially privacy issues.

Open Data Enables Collaboration. Taiwan is a proponent of Open Gov
OP-MSF OGP (Open Government Partnership, 2021; Lab, 2021).

Open Knowledge International's Global Open Data Index (GODI) ranked
Taiwan as number 1 in its global index in 2017; the project has since
been discontinued, so the ranking may be out of date in 2024 (Open
Knowledge Foundation, 2017).

Other indexes do not include Taiwan in the TOP 10.

Data-driven design requires access to data. making the movement towards
\emph{open data sharing} very important. Some countries and cities are
better than others at sharing data openly.

\subsection{Design for Sustainability: Diversity of
Approaches}\label{design-for-sustainability-diversity-of-approaches}

\emph{Designing for Sustainability} \emph{(DfS)} has been called with
many names, with subtle differences of emphasis and nuance. While the
ESPR legislation chose \emph{Eco-Design} as the overarching title,
researchers and practitioners discuss and use \emph{Circular Design},
\emph{Cradle-to-Cradle Design}, \emph{Green Design}, \emph{Regenerative
Design}, \emph{Climate-Responsive Design}, \emph{Life-Centered Design},
and many others.

In most cases, designing for sustainability makes use of \emph{systems
thinking}, underlining the importance of looking at the entire lifecycle
of a product or service. Sustainable design encompasses all human
activities, making this pursuit an over-arching challenge across all
industries and all human activities with the complex interdependencies
contained within. (Ceschin \& Gaziulusoy, 2016) gives a comprehensive
overview of the main themes of sustainable design and the main
contributions and limitations in the well--researched \emph{``Evolution
of design for sustainability: From product design to design for system
innovations and transitions''}.

R. Buckminster Fuller ``Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth'', Victor
Papanek ``Design for the Real World'', Jonathan Chapman ``Emotionally
Durable Design'', Carlo Vezzoli ``Product-Service System Design for
Sustainability'', Ezio Manzini ``Design, When Everybody Designs''.

(Engkvist, 2024) calls for \emph{Design Sociology}, design should take
account the product's effect on society, giving the example of highly
individualized understanding of individualized psychology and dopamine
cycles for creating social media, while disregarding the societal
effects, such as spread of misinformation. Lack of sustainability in the
design process is a \emph{bug} in the design approach.

\emph{Service Design}, Ceschin \& Gaziulusoy (2016) shows how design for
sustainability has expanded from a product focus to systems-thinking
focus placing the product inside a societal context of use. For example
Anon (n.d.i), recycled clothing maker FREITAG offers
sustainability-focused services such as cargo bikes so you can transport
your purchases and a network for \emph{shopping without payment} =
swapping your items with other members, as well as repairs of their
products. Loaning terminology from \emph{service design}, the user
journey within an app needs to consider each touchpoint on the way to a
state of success.

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-32-output-1.pdf}}

As this research is \emph{practice-oriented} (i.e., my goal here is to
find design approaches that could influence my prototype), I will focus
on some fields of design which I hope relevant, fruitful, or contextual
to my project.

I will start with \emph{Human-Centered Design}, the grandfather of
design with attitude. There's even an ISO standard for human-centered
design, with the designated code ISO9241-210, revised as ISO
9241-210:2019 titled \emph{``Ergonomics of human-system interaction''}
and up for revision soon (ISO standards are reviewed every 5 years).
Some of the key takeaways include ``Understanding and specifying the
context of use'', ``Involving users throughout design and development'',
``Specifying user requirements'', ``Evaluating designs'',
``Multi-disciplinary Collaboration'', ``Iterative process'' and
``Continual Improvement'', and finally - usability is not enough, the
design should provide a user experience (UX) for human ``emotional
responses and satisfaction'' (ISO, 2019).

While \emph{Human-Centered Design} focuses exactly on what it says -
humans - \emph{Life-Centered Design} recognizes human impact on our
surrounding environment as well - making sure we include non-human
animals among our stakeholders. This is where we are getting on the
\emph{territory} of sustainability. While \emph{Human-Centered Design}
is ever popular, the effect humans are having on biodiversity is rarely
considered when designing. \emph{``{[}T{]}he design phase of a physical
product accounts for 80\% of its environmental impact''}
notes(Borthwick, Tomitsch \& Gaughwin, 2022) in their framework for
life-centered design.

If we're including \emph{other} lifeforms among our stakeholders, what
can we learn from them? \emph{Biomimicry} is about being inspired by
nature while \emph{Biodesign} focuses on design involving biology in the
design itself. Janine Benyus, who coined the word \emph{Biomimicry}
(Benyus, 2009) looks at very practical cases of innovation where
engineers and biologist meet and (Dicks, 2023) provides a much more
philosophical account of following the example of nature. Focusing on
the financial sector, (Thomas \& Mantri, 2022)'s philosophical account
advocates for an ``inside-out'' design pattern, much like natural
systems, starting from the smallest structures to guarantee resilience
and survival, instead of trying to control their external environment.

In a similar vein, \emph{Material Ecology} is the wording preferred by
the architect Neri Oxman based at the MIT Media Lab working with
biomaterials as a proponent of \emph{Nature-Centric Design} that adheres
to the principles of ecological sustainability with both an ecologically
conscious mindset and practical toolset (Hencz, 2022). Language and our
mental concepts shape our reality, which makes language-creation an
important tool for sustainability. Neri Oxman's expressions in her
(World Economic Forum, 2016) interview introduce some new vocabulary:
\emph{``ecology-indifferent''}, \emph{``naturing''}, \emph{``mother
naturing''}, \emph{``design is a practice of letting go of all that is
unnecessary''}, \emph{``nature should be our single client''}, which
reminds me how self-invented language gives un child-like freedom to
imagine new worlds.

\emph{Speculative Design} can help us imagine \emph{non-anthropocentric}
(Hupkes \& Hedman, 2022; Edwards \& Pettersen, 2023)as well as
\emph{dystopian} futures (Pinto et al., 2021). First introduced by
(Dunne \& Raby, 2013) in their seminal book, the field aims to question
the intersection of \emph{user experience design} and \emph{speculative
fiction}. (Barendregt \& Vaage, 2021) explores the potential of
speculative design to stimulate public engagement; thought experiments
can spur public debate on an issue chosen by the designer. Phil
Balagtas, founder of The Design Futures Initiative at McKinsey,
discusses the value of building future scenarios at his talk at Google.
His favorite example, the Apple Knowledge Navigator, first appeared in
an Apple vision video in 1987 and took two decades to materialize in the
real world. It was inspired by a similar device first shown in a 1970s
episode of Star Trek as a \emph{magic device} (a term from participatory
design), which then inspired subsequent consumer product development. It
took another two decades, until the launch of the iPhone in 2007 - a
total of 40 years.

\emph{Participatory Design} and \emph{Speculative Design} can be
complementary as in the work of (Neuhoff, Simeone \& Laursen, 2023),
used together to focus on engaging users deep in the design process to
truly understand their needs, contexts and interactions on a
non-superficial level. For both speculative and participatory design,
the cost and makes it into a niche activity. Generative AI holds the
promise to allow designers to dream up and prototype quicker. In order
to build a future, it's relevant to imagine and critique a future. By
being quickly generate prototypes, once can test out ideas with the
future users involving more of the community and stakeholders. To be
able to build something, one first needs to imagine it; imagination is
crucial for change.

\emph{Speculative Design} helps us envision future scenarios

Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is a source of many
fantastic innovations, and another.

\emph{Regenerative Design} suggests \emph{de}materializing (digitizing)
economies is not enough to be sustainable (by reduction of physical
impact). Design should look beyond reducing harm and find avenues to
\emph{regenerate} damaged or even completely destroyed natural systems
-- ecosystems, biodiversity, land, forests, lakes, rivers - natural
habitats.

Sufficiency

Moving from products and (digital) experiences towards the built
environment and architecture, \emph{Climate-Responsive Design} embeds a
building within the environmental constraints of a place and looks for
opportunities use the land, wind, sun, local materials, and local
vernacular history and culture when considering a design. Architect
Susanne Brorson suggests sustainability should be considered in the
earlier phases of design instead of trying to fix problems later
discussing \emph{climate-responsive design principles} (EVM
maaarhitektuuri keskus, 2019). The sentiment is echoed by (Lee \&
Doevendans, 2011) who edited a volume on sustainable approaches of
world-renowned architects: \emph{``The principles of sustainable design
are rooted in the building's relationship to the site and its
environmental conditions such as topography, vegetation, and climate.''}

Architecture of the Well-Tempered Environment (Banham, 1999)

\emph{Designing for Trust}, Weinschenk (2011) says \emph{``People expect
most online interactions to follow the same social rules as

\emph{Cradle-to-Cradle Design}, focusing on recyclability of products.
Anon (2021o) and 活動通 (n.d.) Cradle to Cradle Nordic circular design
in Taiwan

\emph{Durability} is an important dimension for sustainability. High
quality durable products are more sustainable as they last longer and
less likely to be thrown away. Forming an emotional bond with the
product makes it feel more valuable (Zonneveld \& Biggemann, 2014).
(Chapman, 2009) argues in his seminal paper (and later in his book) for
\emph{``Emotionally Durable Design''}, the simple idea that we hold to
things we value and thus they are sustainable. We don't throw away a
necklace gifted to us by mom, indeed this object might be passed down
for centuries. (Rose, 2015) has a similar idea, where \emph{``Enchanted
Objects''} become so interlinked with us, we're unlikely to throw them
away. This has implications for sustainability as the object is less
likely to be thrown away.

As the above shows, there are many partially overlapping design words
created by different people for diverse purposes. Design vocabulary may
be created for distinguishing a particular type of design from another -
or to market oneself as the creator of the word. There are designers who
define / brand themselves by their design method. Design Studies, a
field that studies \emph{design} as a subject.

Here I will use the lens of \emph{sustainability} - another complex term
- to look at how design can contribute to eco-friendly products. I
advocate looking at design methods as a toolbox, where I can pick the
tool suitable for the problem set in front of me. Here I look at a small
number of design practices I find relevant to designing a sustainability
app for college students.

than traditional design methods. While AI allows us to look at a larger
number of design scenarios thank previously feasible, there are many
approaches looking for ways to design for sustainability. Designing for
Sustainability is fundamentally a hopeful act imbibed with the dream a
healthier world is possible.

\subsubsection{Future Scenarios: Avoiding the Worst
Cases}\label{future-scenarios-avoiding-the-worst-cases}

In sustainability there are rarely good choices. Rather it's a question
of avoiding the worst choices.

\emph{Scenario-building} is a key tool for sustainability. Because
sustainability is so complex, sustainable design makes use of scenarios.

\emph{Life Cycle Assessment} and \emph{Environmental Impact Analysis}
are needed to provide eco-design scenarios (de Otazu et al., 2022).

user experience, iteration (Google Design, 2019)

\subsubsection{In Practice Sustainability Begins in
Software}\label{in-practice-sustainability-begins-in-software}

Designing user interfaces for sustainable interactions means
incorporating data and toolsets to enable designers to make decisions
which reduce emissions of their design. Companies like AutoDesk are
putting CO\textsubscript{2} calculations inside their design software,
helping designers reduce material usage, energy consumption,
CO\textsubscript{2e} emissions, while increasing recyclability(Mike
Haley, 2022). Software is key to building more sustainable products,
already for decades (Gupta et al., 2023). AI-assisted design enables
design for sustainability because the design process is where
sustainability begins. AI has the potential to provide the parameters
for sustainability. (Singh \& Sarkar, 2023) proposes an AI tool for
deciding the suitable life cycle design parameters.

Design encompasses most everything in our daily lives. Humans live in
artificial environments where \emph{most} \emph{things} are designed by
humans. The \emph{experiences} we take part in are increasingly created
based on some type of data.

\subsection{Data-Driven Design: Learning from the Growth of Digital
Platforms and
Superapps}\label{data-driven-design-learning-from-the-growth-of-digital-platforms-and-superapps}

Digital platforms are focused on \emph{Growth Design}, how to
\emph{attract} and \emph{retain} users. Superapps are the latter stage
of the Digital Platform Economy, where previously vertically targeted
apps expand horizontally to provide an ever-increasing number of
services.

For digital products (apps) the main application of interaction design
is for \emph{growth} in usage, how to get more people (user journey and
conversion funnels) to use the product i.e user acquisition, retention,
engagement, and monetization and keep using it (retention and
engagement), often optimizing onboarding, features, and personalization
(Steger, 2019; Kende, 2023).

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Hypothesis and validation for iterating on features.
\item
  Total addressable market (TAM), serviceable addressable market (SAM),
  target audience (TA)
\end{itemize}

Platform economy companies popularized and expanded Data-Driven Design
in the service of growth marketing (also known colloquially as growth
hacking). Capturing User Data was part of this strategy which enabled
improving the products. Digital Product Design is increasingly
data-driven. Digital platforms operate a \emph{design as a process} in a
continuous feedback loop, where \emph{measurements}, \emph{experiments,}
predictive analytics and personalization form a data-drive design
culture. As we humans go about our daily business, governments and
companies track our activities using various technologies, which
produces massive amounts of user interaction data.

Platform economy companies are the capture and use large amounts of data
from users. Data is useful for designing better products. Designing for
high retention (users keep coming back). Network Effects, the more
people use a platform, the more valuable it becomes. Platforms that
continuously add features (provided consumer legislation allows it) may
eventually evolve into superapps, which are useful for providing
services for a wide category of human needs. Bundling many services
under one super-brand. Superapps are possible thanks to Nudge, Economies
of Scale, Network Effects, Behaviour Design. Large Digital Platforms
have a very small number of workers relative to the number of users they
serve. This creates the necessity for using automation for both
understanding user needs and providing the service itself. Creating a
good product that's useful for the large majority of users depends on
\emph{Data-Driven Design.}

Design is as much about how it works as it's about the interface.

Digital product design can be seen as a specific discipline under the
umbrella of Experience Design. In Michael Abrash (2017) Meta Oculus
augmented reality incubation general manager Laura Fryer: \emph{``People
buy experiences, not technology.''}

Young people expect a product. Intelligent Interfaces use interaction
design to provide relevant and personalized information in the right
context and at the right time.

There are many approaches to design - from playful to practical to
critical and to data-driven. Nonetheless, many types of design share a
common goal designing for a good \emph{user experience}. Simplifying.

\emph{Personalization}: the largest businesses today (measured in number
of users) design the whole user experience.

\emph{Scale,} Popular consumer platforms strive to design solutions that
feel personalized at every touchpoint on the user journey (to use the
language of service design) at the scale of hundreds of billions of
users.

Superapps are honeypots of data that is used for many types of behavior
modeling. (Suarez et al., 2021) suggests using alternative data from
super-apps to estimate user income levels, including 4 types of data:
Personal Information, Consumption Patterns, Payment Information, and
Financial services. (Roa et al., 2021) finds super-app alternative data
is especially useful for credit-scoring young, low-wealth individuals.
The massive amounts of data generated by these companies are used by
smart cities to re-design their physical environments.

every day, help us make decisions about the businesses we engage with?

\subsubsection{Behavioral Design}\label{behavioral-design}

For several decades, marketing researchers have been looking into how to
affect human behavior towards increasing purchase decisions in commerce,
both offline and online, which is why the literature on behavioral
design is massive. One of the key concepts is \emph{nudge}, first coined
in 2008 by the Nobel-winning economist Richard Thaler; nudges are based
on a scientific understanding of human psychology and shortcuts and
triggers that human brains use and leverages that knowledge to influence
humans in small but powerful ways (Thaler \& Sunstein, 2009).

The principles of nudge have also been applied to sustainability. For
example, a small study (n=33) in the Future Consumer Lab in Copenhagen
by (Perez-Cueto, 2021) found that designing a ``dish-of-the-day'' which
was prominently displayed helped to increase vegetarian food choice by
85\%. Experiments by (Guath, Stikvoort \& Juslin, 2022) focused on
environmentally friendly online purchases in Sweden (n=200) suggest
nudging can be effective in influencing online shopping behavior towards
more sustainable options. A study of behavior change in Australia at
large university setting (N = 156) by (Novoradovskaya et al., 2021)
found nudging behavioral change had a significant effect and the author
suggested it may help to avoid some of the \emph{``16 billion paper
coffee cups are being thrown away every year''} globally (based on the
abstract - I was unable to access the full paper).

Google uses nudges in Google Flights and Google Maps, which allow
filtering flights and driving routes by the amount of
CO\textsubscript{2} emissions, as well as surfacing hotels with Green
Key and EarthCheck credentials, while promising new sustainability
features across its portfolio of products (Sundar Pichai, 2021). Such
tools are small user interface nudges which Google's research calls
\emph{digital decarbonization}, defined by (Implement Consulting Group,
2022) as \emph{``Maximising the enabling role of digital technologies by
accelerating already available digital solutions''}.

In (Kate Brandt \& Matt Brittin, 2022), Google's Chief Sustainability
Officer Kate Brandt set a target of ``at least 20-25\%''
CO\textsubscript{2} emission reductions in Europe to reach a net-zero
economy and the global announcement set a target of helping 1 billion
people make more sustainable choices around the world (Jeni Miles,
2022). In addition to end--users, Google offers digital decarbonization
software for developers, including the Google Cloud Carbon Footprint
tool and invests in regenerative agriculture projects (Anon, 2021g;
Google, 2023).

\subsection{Personalized Design:
Self-Monitoring}\label{personalized-design-self-monitoring}

Research on \emph{personal data tracking} also known as \emph{quantified
self} or \emph{self-monitoring} is abundant. Wearable devices including
the Apple Watch, Oura Ring, Fitbit and others, combined with apps, help
users track a variety of health metrics. Apart from health, wearable
devices have been used to track other metrics such as physiological
parameters of students at school to determine their learning efficiency
(Giannakos et al., 2020). Not only can health metrics be tracking, but
exposure to pollution as well as personal carbon footprint, are all to
some extent track-able (if not traceable).

Personal data enables behavior change.

\subsubsection{Health and Fitness
Tracking}\label{health-and-fitness-tracking}

Tracking one's health and fitness is a familiar mode of \emph{quantified
self}, available to many smartwatch users - and even pretty much to
anyone who has a phone made in the past decade. Apple is a leader in
health tracking, releasing Apple Health in 2008 as an iOS 8 software
feature and the Apple Watch in 2015, filled with health-focused sensors
and features (Apple, 2022b). In 2022 Apple outlined plans for
\emph{``empowering people to live a healthier day,''} promising a new
set of health-features with every release, such as the rumored
temperature measurement inside of Apple Aipord earphones; and providing
most of this data to developers through Apple's HealthKit health metrics
APIs, which app builders can tap into (Apple, 2022a, 2022c).

Sleep quality is an important aspect of health and many devices and apps
focus on helping people get enough high quality sleep. There's plenty of
academic literature on how physical activity, as well as environmental
aspects, such as air quality, affect sleep (Liu et al., 2019) tracks how
wearable data is used for tracking sleep improvements from exercise.
(Grigsby-Toussaint et al., 2017) made use of sleep apps to construct
humans behaviors also known as \emph{behavioral constructs}.

The Oura ring is an example of \emph{calm technology}, providing helpful
data without calling an attention to itself (Phelan, 2024).

EEG (electroencephalogram), ECG (Electrocardiogram), EDA (Electrodermal
Activity): tracking features of brain, heart and nervous system
activity. Brain Music Lab founder and brain researcher Grace Leslie:
\emph{``brain music sounds like a warm bathtub''}. Tracking blood sugar
with app and patches. Blood sugar trackers. Blood glucose tracking is
popular even for people without diabetes, to optimize their activity
(Anon, 2021i). Tracking urine consistency inside your toilet with
WithThings. Companies like NeuralLink are building devices to build
meaningful interactions from brain waves (EEG).

Use technology Wearables to be more aware of one's health. Example of
quantified self device.

There's value in developing standardized fitness metrics, which
different digital health providers can use to create dashboards with
comparable data. Even with messy data, AI has a useful role as a
translator between different standards.

Could one track personal sustainability in a similar fashion? (Shin et
al., 2019)'s synthesis review of 463 studies shows wearable devices have
potential to influence behavior change towards healthier lifestyles.
Saubade et al. (2016) finds health tracking is useful for motivating
physical activity. The urban environment has an influence on health.

While so of the behavior changes may sound simple - like switching from
driving to walking - and would have a large environmental effect, they
are hindered by factors from personal motivation to (lack of) suitable
urban architecture. (Delclòs-Alió et al., 2022) discusses walking in
Latin-American cities. Walking is the most sustainable method or
transport but requires the availability of city infrastructure, such as
sidewalks, which many cities still lack.

While the scale of climate change is too big for individual action to
make a difference, individual action can foster hope and a sense of
collective responsibility (Nature, 2020).

  `green-minded' demographics, providing a reliable green product is a
  way to build customer loyalty.
\end{itemize}

Another aspect is tracking one's mental health. (Tyler, Boldi \&

The small screen estate space of mobiles phones and smart watches
necessitates displaying content in a dynamic manner. Virtual reality
glasses (called AR/VR or XR in marketing speak) need dynamic content
because the user is able to move around the environment. These are
questions that interaction design is called upon to solve. Hoang (2022):
\emph{``Dynamic interfaces might invoke a new design language for
extended reality''. it's a balancing at: while} AI enables generative
UIs while users need some type of stability (think: text input stays in
the same place but different types of interfaces appear within a clearly
defined space.

Speaking is one mode of interaction that's become increasingly possible
as machines learn to interpret human language.

\subsubsection{Towards Tracking Sustainability: Carbon
Tracking}\label{towards-tracking-sustainability-carbon-tracking}

The founder of the Commons (formerly known as Joro) consumer
CO\textsubscript{2e} tracking app recounts how people have a gut feeling
about the 2000 calories one needs to eat daily, so perhaps daily
CO\textsubscript{2e} tracking could develop a gut feeling about one's
carbon footprint (Jason Jacobs, 2019).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
\end{itemize}

Personal carbon footprint tracking apps (aka CO2 calculators) in a
mid-sized German city (N=216) helped overall emission reduction by 23\%
correlating with feedback from the app specifically reducing emissions
from heating 26.9\%, food 16.4\%, household 34.7\% reduction, and
mobility 12\%(Hoffmann et al., 2024).

We have a limited carbon budget so calculating CO2e-cost become
integrated into every activity.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  CO2e calculations will be part of our everyday experience
\item
  Zhang's Personal Carbon Economy conceptualized the idea of carbon as a
  currency used for buying and selling goods and services, as well as an
  individual carbon exchange to trade one's carbon permits (Zhang,
  2018).
\end{itemize}

Personal Carbon Trackers

Personal carbon footprint calculators have been released online, ranging
from those made by governments and companies to student projects.
Similar to personal health trackers, personal CO\textsubscript{2}
trackers help one track emissions and suggests sustainable actions.

\subsection{Re-Designing Industries:
Circularity}\label{re-designing-industries-circularity}

As of 2024, \emph{circular economy} is a tiny part of the world economy.
(Circle Economy, 2022) reports only 8.6\% of world economy is circular
and \emph{100B tonnes of virgin materials} are sourced every year.

We're in an industrial revolution. Many companies are investing into
transforming their processes. \emph{``{[}T{]}ransition to a low carbon
economy presents challenges and potential economic benefits that are
comparable to those of previous industrial revolutions''} (Pearson \&
Foxon, 2012). It's possible to re-design entire industries and that is
exactly the expectation sustainability sets on businesses. Across all
industries, there's a call for more transparency. Conversations about
sustainability are too general and one needs to look at the specific
sustainability metrics at specific industries to be able to design for
meaningful interaction. There's plentiful domain-specific research
showing how varied industries can develop eco-designed products. I will
here focus on 3 industries that are relevant for college students.

Food and clothes (I'm omitting housing and transport here) are part of
the immediate environmental impact of college students.

globally. (Thukral \& Singh, 2023) identifies several barriers to

\subsubsection{Case: Fast-Moving Consumer Goods
(FMCG)}\label{case-fast-moving-consumer-goods-fmcg}

Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) also known as Consumer Packaged Goods
(CPG) are large global congloremates operating with low margins and high
volumes (Toh, 2024). The largest of them have several billions in
revenue (Kenton, 2024).

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-37-output-1.pdf}}

Rise of e-commerce has pushed logistics companies to increase delivery
efficiency to keep up with FMCG sales (Deliverect, 2024).

\subsubsection{Case: Fashion}\label{case-fashion}

Just like Fast-Moving Consumer Goods, fast fashion operates with low
margins and follows consumer trends. Young people are the largest
consumers of fast fashion (Anon, n.d.bu). (In European Environment
Agency, 2022 European Environment Agency (EEA)) estimates based on trade
and production data that EU27 citizens consumed an average 15kg of
textile products per person per year. The European Commission wants to
reduce the impact of fast fashion on EU market (ERR, 2022).
(Millward-Hopkins, Purnell \& Baurley, 2023) shows how 50\% of the
textile waste in the UK is exported to other countries.

``26 million tons of clothing end up in China's landfills each year,
propelled by fast fashion'' (Tian Macleod Ji, 2024).

Greenwashing is prevalent in the fashion industry. \textbf{Problem}:
Emily Chan (2022a) report says there's not enough transparency in
fashion. Fashion Revolution Foundation (2022) Fashion transparency
index. (Wikirate, 2022b): ``Among the Index's main goals are to help
different stakeholders to better understand what data and information is
being disclosed by the world's largest fashion brands and retailers,
raise public awareness, educate citizens about the social and
environmental challenges facing the global fashion industry and support
people's activism''. Consumer understanding of sustainability is
limited. Mabuza, Sonnenberg \& Marx-Pienaar (2023) shows consumer
knowledge of apparel coloration is very limited.

2.4 Trillion USD fashion industry contributing 2\%-8\% of total global
GHG emissions, 100B USD lost to lack of recycling, contributes 9\% of
microplastics (Adamkiewicz et al., 2022). (Centobelli et al., 2022)
Fashion industry year uses 9B cubic meters of water, 1.7B tonnes of
CO\textsubscript{2}, 92 million tonnes of textile waste. Köhler et al.
(2021) Globally 87\% of textile products are burned or landfilled after
1st consumer use.

\paragraph{Towards Sustainable
Clothes}\label{towards-sustainable-clothes}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  There are local policy initiatives aiming to tackle the waste problem.
  For example the New Standard Institute's proposed ``Fashion Act'' to
  require brands doing business in New York City to disclose
  sustainability data and set waste reduction targets (Emily Chan,
  2022b) .
\item
  (Leung \& Luximon, 2021) There's a growing know-how on how to produce
  sustainably and which materials to use. ``Handbook of Footwear Design

\subsubsection{Case: Food}\label{case-food}

Re-designing industrial food systems for an increasing global population
is a challenge. Supply chain innovation in food industries may enable
more transparency. \textbf{provenance and traceability of food has
implications for sustainability and health.}

Global warming leading to droughts and extreme weather, wars and
conflicts increased volatility in food prices (Eshe Nelson, Ana Swanson
\& Jeanna Smialek, 2023).

``The agricultural sector contributes to approximately 13.5\% of the
total global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and accounts for
25\% of the total CO\textsubscript{2} emission'' (Nabipour Afrouzi et
al., 2023). Poore \& Nemecek (2018) suggests 26\% of carbon emissions
come from food production. Saner et al. (2015) reports dairy (46\%) and
meat and fish (29\%) products making up the largest GHG emission
potential. Springmann et al. (2021) proposes veganism is the most
effective decision to reduce personal CO\textsubscript{2} emissions.

\emph{Farm to Fork} is a European Union policy to shorten the supply
chain from the producer to the consumer and add transparency to the
system. Patel et al. (2023) livestock products (meat) are 15\% of
agricultural foods valued at €152 billion in 2018 globally.

\textbf{Fishing}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  75\% of fishing is done using industrial Trawling, which has
  environmental impact
\item
  Bailey \& Eggereide (2020) shows how the Norwegian government plans to
  increase salmon production 5x by 2050. How can this be sustainable?
  Mostly this means fish-farming
\item
  Complex supply chains make seafood (marine Bivalvia, mollusks)
  logistics prone to fraud, leading to financial losses and threats to
  consumer health (Santos et al., 2023). (Chang et al., 2021) \emph{fish
  fraud} is a large global problem but it's possible to use DNA-tracking
  to prove where the fish came from. In ``2019, the 27 KURA SUSHI
  branches in Taiwan sold more than 46 million plates of sushi. in
  Taiwan''. Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IIU) fishing is
  widespread; the EU is adopting countermeasures (Kim \& Lim, 2024).
  Muñoz et al. (2023) Is there such a thing as sustainable fishing?
  Bottom trawling is the worst and should be banned. Katie Gustafson
  (2022) proposes a \textbf{``Uniform traceability system for the entire
  supply chain''} for seafood. Mamede et al. (2022) proposes
  \emph{Seafood tracing}: Fingerprinting of Sea Urchin.
\item
  The same is true for cocoa beans, which are at risk from food fraud
  (Fanning et al., 2023).
\item
  \textbf{Perennial Crops,} Multi-year crops reduce inputs of gasoline,
  labor, etc. (Aubrey Streit Krug \& Yin Lu, 2023). Large agritech
  companies like Monsanto rely on selling seeds annually for profits
  putting them at odds with \textbf{Perennial crops}. Single-year seeds
  have led to farmer suicides when crops fail in poor communities.

\subsubsection{Circular Design}\label{circular-design}

Circular design is only possible if supply chains become circular as
well.

It's important in which structure data is stored, affecting the ability
to efficiently access and manage the data while guaranteeing a high
level of data integrity, security, as well as energy usage of said data.

The complexity of resource and delivery networks necessitates more
advanced tools to map supply chains (Knight et al., 2022). The COVID19
pandemic and resulting blockages in resource delivery highlighted the
need to have real-time visibility into supply chains (Finkenstadt \&
Handfield, 2021).

Blockchains are a type of shared database where the data is stored in
several locations with a focus on making the data secure and very
difficult to modify after it's been written to the database. Once data
is written to the blockchain, modifying it would require changing all
subsequent records in the chain and agreement of the majority of
validators who host a version of the database. Blockchain is the main
technology considered for accounting for the various inputs and complex
web of interactions between many participants inside the supply chain
networks. There are hundreds of paper researching blockchain use in
supply change operations since 2017 (Dutta et al., 2020). Blockchains
enable saving immutable records into distributed databases (also known
as ledgers). It's not possible to (or extremely difficult) to change the
same record, only new records can be added on top of new ones.
Blockchains are useful for data sharing and auditing, as the time and
place of data input can be guaranteed, and it will be easier to conduct
a search on who inputted incorrect data; however the system still relies
on correct data input. As the saying goes, \emph{``garbage in, garbage
out''}.

There are several technologies for tracking goods across the supply
chain, from shipping to client delivery. Data entry is a combination of
manual data input and automated record-keeping facilitated by sensors
and integrated internet of things (IoT) capabilities. For example
(Ashraf \& Heavey, 2023) describes using the Solana blockchain and
Sigfox internet of things (IoT) Integration for supply chain
traceability where Sigfox does not need direct access to internet but
can send low powered messages across long distances (for example
shipping containers on the ocean). (Van Wassenaer et al., 2023) compares
use cases for blockchains in enhancing traceability, transparency and
cleaning up the supply chain in agricultural products.

\textbf{Tracking Transport Supply Chains}

Products are made from resources distributed across the planet and
transported to clients around the world which currently causes high
levels (and increasing) of greenhouse gases. \emph{``Transport
greenhouse gas emissions have increased every year since 2014''} (Anon,
2023d). Freight (transport of goods by trucks, trains, planes, ships)
accounts for 1.14 gigatons of CO\textsubscript{2} emissions as per 2015
data or 16\% of total international supply chain emissions (Wang et al.,
2022).

\subsubsection{Extended Producer
Responsibility}\label{extended-producer-responsibility}

Extended Producer Responsibility Enables Companies to be Resposible.

Popular blogs such as (Kohli, 2019) and (Lose, 2023) offer many
suggestions how designers can help people become more sustainable in
their daily lives yet focusing on the end-user neglects the producers'
responsibility (termed as Extended Producer Responsibility or ERP) in
waste management studies.

Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is a policy tool first proposed
by Thomas Lindhqvist in Sweden in 1990 {[}ADD CITATION{]}, aimed to
encourage producers take responsibility for the entire life-cycle of
their products, thus leading to more eco-friendly products. Nonetheless,
EPR schemes do not guarantee circularity and may instead be designed
around fees to finance waste management in linear economy models
(Christiansen, Hasse \& Tønder, 2021). The French EPR scheme was
upgraded in 2020 to become more circular (Jacques Vernier, 2021). In
July 2024, Latvia was the 4th EU country to join an textile-EPR scheme
(Anon, 2024d).

In any case, strong consumer legislation (such as EPR) has a direct
influence on producers' actions. For example, in HKTDC Research (2022),
the Hong Kong Trade Development Council notified textile producers in
July 2022 reminding factories to produce to French standards in order to
be able enter the EU market. Peng, Shi \& Tong (2023) finds that the
\textbf{\emph{Carbon Disclosure Project}} has been a crucial tool to
empower ERP in Chinese auto-producers.

\subsubsection{Digital Product
Passports}\label{digital-product-passports}

Even though this topic belongs under Circular Economy, I've chose to
highlight \emph{digital product passports} here as it's the main design
implication from this chapter - an emerging technology which needs to be
designed for the user.

I will being with a bit of history to contextualize what has already
been tried. CO\textsubscript{2e} labeling initiatives are an early form
of communicating the environmental cost of each product. Using carbon
labels to communicate CO\textsubscript{2e} emission of consumer products
has been a topic of discussion for decades (Adam Corner, 2012). Academic
literature has looked at minute details such as color and positioning of
the label (Zhou et al., 2019). There's some indication consumers are
willing to pay a small premium for low-CO\textsubscript{2e} products;
all else being equal, consumers choose the option with a lower
CO\textsubscript{2e} number (Xu \& Lin, 2022; Carlsson, Kataria \&
Lampi, 2022). (Cohen \& Vandenbergh, 2012) argues labeling the carbon
footprint of products does help inform consumer choice towards
sustainability and help promote a green economy. A large-scale study of
UK university students finds some evidence to suggest labeling low
CO\textsubscript{2e} food enables people to choose a \emph{climatarian
diet}, however the impact of carbon labels on the market share of
low-carbon meals is negligible (Lohmann et al., 2022).

Labels alone are not enough. A study in Sweden underlines a negative
correlation between worrying about climate impact and interest in
climate information on products (Edenbrandt \& Lagerkvist, 2022). This
latter finding may be interpreted to suggest a need for wider
environmental education programs among consumers. (Asioli et al., 2022)
found differences between countries, where Spanish and British consumers
chose meat products with \emph{`No antibiotics ever'} over a
\emph{Carbon Trust} label, whereas French consumers chose
CO\textsubscript{2} labeled meat products.

however several studies show their effect is negligible. Nonetheless,
the idea of \emph{Carbon Labelling} is yet to find mainstream adoption.

Carbon labeling is voluntary. Only a handful of companies practice
carbon-labeling but the number is growing. The U.S. restaurant chain
\emph{Just Salad} , U.K.-based vegan meat-alternative \emph{Quorn} and
plant milk \emph{Oatly} are some example of companies that provide
carbon labeling on their products (Brian Kateman, 2020).
(ClimatePartner, 2020): Companies like ClimatePartner and Carbon
Calories offers labeling consumer goods with emission data as a service.
(The Carbon Trust, n.d.): The Carbon Trust reports it's certified 27
thousand product footprints.

historic performance, etc., for preparing advisory guidance to their

\section{Human Patterns}\label{human-patterns}

The fact that AI systems work so well is proof that we live in a
measurable world. The world is filled with structures: nature, cultures,
languages, human interactions - all form intricate patterns. Computer
systems are increasingly capable in their ability copy these patterns
into computer models - known as machine learning. As of 2023, 97
zettabytes (and growing) of data was created in the world per year
(Soundarya Jayaraman, 2023). Big data is a basic requirement for
training AIs, enabling learning from the structures of the world with
increasing accuracy. Representations of the real world in digital models
enable humans to ask questions about the real-world structures and to
manipulate them to create synthetic experiments that may match the real
world (if the model is accurate enough). This can be used for generating
human-sounding language and realistic images, finding mechanisms for
novel medicines as well as understanding the fundamental functioning of
life on its deep physical and chemical level (No Priors: AI, Machine
Learning, Tech, \& Startups, 2023).

In essence, Human Patterns Enable AIs. Already ninety years ago
(McCulloch \& Pitts, 1943) proposed the first mathematical model of a
neural network inspired by the human brain. Alan Turing's Test for
Machine Intelligence followed in 1950. Turing's initial idea was to
design a game of imitation to test human-computer interaction using text
messages between a human and 2 other participants, one of which was a
human, and the other - a computer. The question was, if the human was
simultaneously speaking to another human and a machine, could the
messages from the machine be clearly distinguished or would they
resemble a human being so much, that the person asking questions would
be deceived, unable to realize which one is the human and which one is
the machine? (Turing, 1950).

\begin{quote}
Alan Turing: \emph{``I believe that in about fifty years' time it will
be possible to program computers, with a storage capacity of about
10\textsuperscript{9}, to make them play the imitation game so well that
an average interrogator will not have more than 70 percent chance of
making the right identification after five minutes of questioning.
\ldots{} I believe that at the end of the century the use of words and
general educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able
to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted.''} -
from (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 2021)
\end{quote}

By the 2010s AI models became capable enough to beat humans in games of
Go and Chess, yet they did not yet pass the Turing test. AI use was
limited to specific tasks. While over the years, the field of AI had
seen a long process of incremental improvements, developing increasingly
advanced models of decision-making, it took an \textbf{\emph{increase in
computing power}} and an approach called \textbf{\emph{deep learning}},
a variation of \textbf{\emph{machine learning (1980s),}} largely modeled
after the \textbf{\emph{neural networks}} of the biological (human)
brain, returning to the idea of \textbf{\emph{biomimicry}}, inspired by
nature, building a machine to resemble the connections between neurons,
but digitally, on layers much deeper than attempted before.

use cases for AI'' Pokrass (2024) How can AI interfaces
enable/help/encourage sustainability? AI-fying User Interfaces (for
Sustainability)

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Human
Feedback}}{Human Feedback}}\label{human-feedback}

Combining deep learning and \emph{reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF)} enabled to achieve levels of intelligence high enough
to beat the Turing test (Kara Manke, 2022; Christiano, 2021; Christiano
et al., 2017). John Schulman, a co-founder of OpenAI describes RLHF
simply: \emph{``the models are just trained to produce a single message
that gets high approval from a human reader''} (Kara Manke, 2022).

The nature-inspired approach was successful. Innovations such as
\emph{back-propagation} for reducing errors through updating model
weights and \emph{transformers} for tracking relationships in sequential
data (for example in sentences), enabled AI models to became
increasingly capable (Vaswani et al., 2017; Merritt, 2022). Generative
Adversarial Networks*** (GAN), (\textbf{ADD CITATION, 2016}), and
\textbf{\emph{Large Language Models (}ADD CITATION\emph{, 2018)}},
enabled increasingly generalized models, capable of more complex tasks,
such as language generation. One of the leading scientists in this field
of research, Geoffrey Hinton, had attempted back-propagation already in
the 1980s and reminiscents how \emph{``the only reason neural networks
didn't work in the 1980s was because we didn't have have enough data and
we didn't have enough computing power''} (CBS Mornings, 2023). (Epoch
AI, 2024) reports the growth in computing power and the evolution of
more than 800 AI models since the 1950s. Very simply, more data and more
computing power means more intelligent models.

By the 2020s, AI-based models became a mainstay in medical research,
drug development, patient care (Leite et al., 2021; Holzinger et al.,
2023), quickly finding potential vaccine candidates during the COVID19
pandemic (Zafar \& Ahamed, 2022), self-driving vehicles, including cars,
delivery robots, drones in the sea and air, as well as AI-based
assistants. The existence of AI models has wide implications for all
human activities from personal to professional. The founder of the
largest chimp-maker NVIDIA calls upon all countries do develop their own
AI-models which would encode their local knowledge, culture, and
language to make sure these are accurately captured (World Governments
Summit, 2024).

OpenAI has researched a wide range of approaches towards artificial
general intelligence (AGI), work which has led to advances in large
language models(Ilya Sutskever, 2018; AI Frontiers, 2018). In 2020
OpenAI released a LLM called GPT-3 trained on 570 GB of text (Alex
Tamkin \& Deep Ganguli, 2021) which was adept in text-generation.
(Singer et al., 2022) describes how collecting billions of images with
descriptive data (for example the descriptive \emph{alt} text which
accompanies images on websites) enabled researchers to train AI models
such as \textbf{\emph{stable diffusion}} for image-generation based on
human-language. These training make use of \emph{Deep Learning}, a
layered approach to AI training, where increasing depth of the computer
model captures minute details of the world. Much is still to be
understood about how deep learning works; even for specialists, the
fractal structure of deep learning can only be called \emph{mysterious}
(Sohl-Dickstein, 2024).

AI responses are probabilistic and need some function for ranking
response quality. Achieving higher percentage or correct responses
requires oversight which can come in the form of human feedback or by
using other AIs systems which are deemed to be already well-aligned
(termed Constitutional AI by Anthropic) (Bailey, 2023; Bai et al.,
2022). Less powerful AIs areFor example META used LLAMA 2 for aligning
LLAMA 3.

One approach to reduce the issues with AI is to introduce some function
for human feedback and oversight to automated systems. Human involvement
can take the form of interventions from the AI-developer themselves as
well as from the end-users of the AI system.

There are many examples of combination of AI and human, also known as
\emph{``human-in-the-loop'',} used for fields as diverse as training
computer vision algorithms for self-driving cars and detection of
disinformation in social media posts (Wu et al., 2023; Bonet-Jover et
al., 2023).

Also known as Human-based computation or human-aided artificial
intelligence (Shahaf \& Amir, 2007; Mühlhoff, 2019)

\subsubsection{The Idiot Savant}\label{the-idiot-savant}

Hinton likes to call AI an \emph{idiot savant}: someone with exceptional
aptitude yet serious mental disorder (CBS Mornings, 2023). Large AI
models don't understand the world like humans do. Their responses are
predictions based on their training data and complex statistics. Indeed,
the comparison is apt, as the AI field now offers jobs for \emph{AI
psychologists (ADD CITATION)}, whose role is to figure out what exactly
is happening inside the `AI brain'. Understading the insides of AI
models trained of massive amounts of data is important because they are
\emph{foundational}, enabling a holistic approach to learning, combining
many disciplines using languages, instead of the reductionist way we as
human think because of our limitations (CapInstitute, 2023).

Standford ``thorough account of the opportunities and risks of
foundation models'' (Bommasani et al., 2021).

Foundation models in turn enabled \emph{generative AIs}, a class of
models which are able to generate many types of \emph{tokens\textbf{,}}
such as text, speech, audio (San Roman et al., 2023; Kreuk et al.,
2022), music (Copet et al., 2023; Meta AI, 2023), video, and even
complex structures such 3D models and DNA structures, in any language
it's trained on. The advent of generative AIs was a revolution in
human-computer interaction as AI models became increasingly capable of
producing human-like content which is hard to distinguish from actual
human creations. This power comes with \emph{increased need for
responsibility}, drawing growing interest in fields like \emph{AI
ethics} and \emph{AI explainability.} Generative has a potential for
misuse, as humans are increasingly confused by what is
computer-generated and what is human-created, unable to separate one
from the other with certainty.

The technological leap is great enough for people to start calling it a
start of a new era.(Noble et al., 2022) proposes AI has reached a stage
of development marking beginning of the \emph{5th industrial
revolution}, a time of collaboration between humans and AI. Widespread
Internet of Things (IoT) sensor networks that gather data analyzed by AI
algorithms, integrates computing even deeper into the fabric of daily
human existence. Several terms of different origin but considerable
overlap describe this phenomenon, including \emph{Pervasive Computing
(PC)} (Rogers, 2022) and \emph{Ubiquitous Computing}. Similar concepts
are \emph{Ambient Computing}, which focuses more on the invisibility of
technology, fading into the background, without us, humans, even
noticing it, and \emph{Calm Technology}, which highlights how technology
respects humans and our limited attention spans, and doesn't call
attention to itself. In all cases, AI is integral part of our everyday
life, inside everything and everywhere. Today AI is not an academic
concept but a mainstream reality, affecting our daily lives everywhere,
even when we don't notice it.

\subsubsection{Algorithmic Transparency: Before
AIs}\label{algorithmic-transparency-before-ais}

Before AIs, as a user of social media, one may be accustomed to
interacting with the feed algorithms that provide a personalized
\emph{algorithmic experience}. Social media user feed algorithms are
more \emph{deterministic} than AI, meaning they would produce more
predictable output in comparison AI models. Nonetheless, there are many
reports about effects these algorithms have on human psychology
\textbf{(ADD CITATION)}.

Design is increasingly relevant to algorithms, - \emph{algorithm design}
- and more specifically to algorithms that affect user experience and
user interfaces. \textbf{\emph{When the design is concerned with the
ethical, environmental, socioeconomic, resource-saving, and
participatory aspects of human-machine interactions and aims to affect
technology in a more human direction, it can hope to create an
experience designed for sustainability.}}

Lorenzo, Lorenzo \& Lorenzo (2015) underlines the role of design beyond
\emph{designing} as a tool for envisioning; in her words, \emph{``design
can set agendas and not necessarily be in service, but be used to find
ways to explore our world and how we want it to be''}. Practitioners of
Participatory Design (PD) have for decades advocated for designers to
become more activist through \textbf{\emph{action research}}. This means
to influencing outcomes, not only being a passive observer of phenomena
as a researcher, or only focusing on usability as a designer, without
taking into account the wider context.

Shenoi (2018) argues inviting domain expertise into the discussion while
having a sustainable design process enables designers to design for
experiences where they are not a domain expert; this applies to highly
technical fields, such as medicine, education, governance, and in our
case here - finance and sustainability -, while building respectful
dialogue through participatory design. After many years of political
outcry (ADD CITATION), social media platforms such Meta Facebook and
Twitter (later renamed to X) have begun to shed more light on how these
algorithms work, in some cases releasing the source code (Nick Clegg,
2023; Twitter, 2023).

The content on the platform can be more important than the interface.
Applications with a similar UI depend on the community as well as the
content and how the content is shown to the user.

\subsubsection{Transitioning to Complexity: Non-Deterministic
Systems}\label{transitioning-to-complexity-non-deterministic-systems}

AIs are non-deterministic, which requires a new set of consideration
when designing AI.

AI systems may make use of several algorithms within one larger model.
It follows that AI Explainability requires \emph{\textbf{Algorithmic
Transparency}.}

\subsubsection{Being Responsible, Explainable, and
Safe}\label{being-responsible-explainable-and-safe}

The problems of opaqueness creates the field of explainable AI.

\emph{``As humans we tend to fear what we don't understand''} is a
common sentiment which has been confirmed psychology (Allport, 1979).
Current AI-models are opaque '\emph{black boxes'}, where it's difficult
to pin-point exactly why a certain decision was made or how a certain
expression was reached, not unlike inside the human brain. This line of
thought leads me to the idea of \textbf{\emph{AI psychologists,}} who
might figure out the \textbf{\emph{thought patterns}} inside the model.
Research in AI-explainability (XAI in literature) is on the lookout for
ways to create more \textbf{\emph{transparency and credibility}} in AI
systems, which could lead to building trust in AI systems and would form
the foundations for \textbf{\emph{AI acceptance}}.

Red-teaming means pushing the limits of LLMs, trying to get them to
produce outputs that are racist, false, or otherwise unhelpful.

There's an increasing number of tools for LLM evaluation:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  ``Evaluate and Track LLM Applications, Explainability for Neural
  Networks'' (TruEra, 2023; Leino et al., 2018)
\item
  ``evaluate your Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines,
  Metrics-Driven Development'' Ragas (2023)
\item
  LangSmith ``developer platform for every step of the LLM-powered
  application lifecycle, whether you're building with LangChain or not.
  Debug, collaborate, test, and monitor your LLM applications.''
  LangChain (2024)
\item
  Tristan Greene (2022): when the quality of AI responses becomes good
  enough, people begin to get confused.
\end{itemize}

Bowman (2023) says steering Large Language Models is unreliable; even
experts don't fully understand the inner workings of the models. Work
towards improving both \textbf{\emph{AI steerability}} and
\textbf{\emph{AI alignment}} (doing what humans expect) is ongoing.
Liang et al. (2022) believes there's early evidence it's possible to
assess the quality of LLM output transparently. Cabitza et al. (2023)
proposes a framework for quality criteria and explainability of
AI-expressions. Khosravi et al. (2022) proposes a framework for AI
explainability, focused squarely on education. Holzinger et al. (2021)
highlights possible approaches to implementing transparency and
explainability in AI models. While AI outperforms humans on many tasks,
humans are experts in multi-modal thinking, bridging diverse fields.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Bigger models aren't necessarily better; rather models need human
  feedback to improve the quality of responses Ouyang et al. (2022)
\item
  The user experience (UX) of AI is a topic under active development by
  all the largest online platforms. The general public is familiar with
  the most famous AI helpers, ChatGPT, Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa,
  Microsoft's Cortana, Google's Assistant, Alibaba's Genie, Xiaomi's
  Xiao Ai, and many others. For general, everyday tasks, such as asking
  factual questions, controlling home devices, playing media, making
  orders, and navigating the smart city.

Responsible AI Seeks to Mitigate Generative AIs' Known Issues.

Given the widespread use of AI and its increasing power of foundational
models, it's important these systems are created in a safe and
responsible manner. While there have been calls to pause the development
of large AI experiments (Future of Life Institute, 2023) so the world
could catch up, this is unlikely to happen. There are several problems
with the current generation of LLMs from OpenAI, Microsoft, Google,
Nvidia, and others.

Problem & Description \\
Monolithicity & LLMs are massive monolithic models requiring large
amounts of computing power for training to offer
\textbf{\emph{multi-modal}} \textbf{\emph{capabilities}} across diverse
domains of knowledge, making training such models possible for very few
companies. Liu et al. (2023c) proposes future AI models may instead
consist of a number networked domain-specific models to increase
efficiency and thus become more scalable. \\
Opaqueness & LLMs are opaque, making it difficult to explain why a
certain prediction was made by the AI model. One visible expression of
this problem are \emph{\textbf{hallucinations},} the language models are
able to generate text that is confident and eloquent yet entirely wrong.
Jack Krawczyk, the product lead for Google's Bard (now renamed to
Gemini): ``Bard and ChatGPT are large language models, not knowledge
models. They are great at generating human-sounding text, they are not
good at ensuring their text is fact-based. Why do we think the big first
application should be Search, which at its heart is about finding true
information?'' \\
Biases and Prejudices & AI bias is well-documented and a hard problem to
solve (Liang et al., 2023). \textbf{Humans don't necessarily correct
mistakes made by computers and may instead become ``partners in crime''}
(Krügel, Ostermaier \& Uhl, 2023). People are prone to bias and
prejudice. It's a part of the human psyche. Human brains are limited and
actively avoid learning to save energy. These same biases are likely to
appear in LLM outputs as they are trained on human-produced content.
Unless there is active work to try to counter and eliminate these biases
from LLM output, they will appear frequently. \\
Missing Data & LLMs have been pre-trained on massive amounts of public
data, which gives them the ability for for reasoning and generating in a
human-like way, yet they are missing specific private data, which needs
to be ingested to augment LLMs ability to respond to questions on niche
topics (Liu, 2022). \\
Data Contamination & Concerns with the math ability of LLMs.
``performance actually reflects dataset contamination, where data
closely resembling benchmark questions leaks into the training data,
instead of true reasoning ability'' Zhang et al. (2024) \\
Lack of Legislation & Anderljung et al. (2023) OpenAI proposes we need
to proactively work on common standards and legislation to ensure AI
safety. It's difficult to come up with clear legislation; the U.K.
government organized the first AI safety summit in 2023 Browne
(2023). \\
\end{longtable}

In 2024, OpenAI released its ``Model Spec'' to define clearly their
approach to AI safety with the stated intention to provide clear
guidelines for the RLHF approach. OpenAI (2024c)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  OpenAI does not yet understand how the internal of an neural network
  work; they are developing tools to represent NNs concepts for humans
  (OpenAI, 2024a; Gao et al., 2024).
\item
  AI co-founder launches AI Safety Superalignment (Jan Leike \& Ilya
  Sutskever, 2023).
\item
  OECD defines AI incident terms Anon (2024b)
\item
  Foundation data-sets such as LAION-5B (Romain Beaumont, 2022;
  Schuhmann et al., 2022)
\item

\end{itemize}

\emph{AI acceptance} is incumbent on traits that are increasingly
human-like and would make a human be acceptable: credibility,
trustworthiness, reliability, dependability, integrity, character, etc.

\subsubsection{Evolution of Models and Emerging
Abilities}\label{evolution-of-models-and-emerging-abilities}

Mapping the emerging abilities of new models.

The debate between Open Source v.s. Closed-Source AI is ongoing.
Historically open-source has been useful for finding bugs in code as
more pairs of eyes are looking at the code and someone may see a problem
the programmers have not noticed. Proponents of closed-source
development however worry about the dangers or releasing such powerful
technology openly and the possibility of bad actors such as terrorists,
hackers, violent governments using LLMs for malice. The question whether
closed-sourced or open-sourced development will be lead to more AI
safety is one of the large debates in the AI industry. In any case, open
or closed-sourced, real-world usage of LLMs may demonstrate the
limitations and edge-cases of AI. Hackathons such as (Pete, 2023) help
come up with new use-cases and disprove some potential ideas.

The proliferation of different models enables comparisons of performance
based on several metrics from accuracy of responses to standardized
tests such as GMAT usually taken my humans to reasoning about less well
defined problem spaces. (Chiang et al., 2024; lmsys.org, 2024)
open-source AI-leaderboard project has collected over 500 thousand
human-ranking of outputs from 82 large-language models, evaluating
reasoning capabilities, which currently rate GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus as
the top-performers. (Zellers et al., 2019)'s HellaSwag paper is also
accompanied by a leaderboard website (still being updated after
publication) listing AI model performance most recent entry April 16,
2024).

Another important metric is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
performance. Generative AI applications retrieve data from unstructured
external sources in order to augment LLMs existing knowledge with
current information (Leng et al., Mon, 08/12/2024 - 19:46).

\subsection{Price of Tokens}\label{price-of-tokens}

At the end of the day, the adoption of AI to everyday life, even in the
smallest of contexts, will come down to the price. Long-time AI-engineer
(Ng, 2024) predicts, having seen the roadmaps for the microchip
industries, as well as incoming hardware and software innovations, the
price of tokens will be very low, and much lower than a comparative
human worker.

\subsection{Acceptance}\label{acceptance}

\subsubsection{Human Expectations Take Time to
Change}\label{human-expectations-take-time-to-change}

Humans still need some time to adjust their expectations of \emph{what's
possible} using conversational AI interfaces. (Bailey, 2023) believes
people are used to \emph{search engines} and it will take a little bit
time to get familiar with talking to a computer in natural language to
accomplish their tasks. For example, new users of v0, an AI assistant
for building user interfaces through conversation, would tell humans
(the company make this app) about the issues they encounter, instead of
telling the AI assistant directly, even though the AI in many cases
would be able to fix the problem instantly; human users don't yet
necessarily expect computers to behave like another human, there's
\emph{inertia} in the mental model of what computers are capable of,
requiring the user interfaces to provide context and teaching humans how
to interact with their AI coworkers(Rauch, 2024). Indeed, ChatGPT is
already using buttons to explain context (Feifei Liu 刘菲菲, n.d.).

\subsubsection{Affective Computing Enables Friendly
Machines}\label{affective-computing-enables-friendly-machines}

\emph{Rosalind Picard} founded the field of \emph{affective computing},
aiming to make computers more human-friendly, pioneering early
approaches to recognizing human emotions with sensors and providing
users experiences that take human emotion into account (Picard, 1997).

It's not an overstatement to say that data from all the processes around
us will define the future of computing (HIITTV, 2021). In the early
examples, electrodermal activity of the skin and heart-rate variance
data were used to detect the emotional state and stress level of the
user (Zangróniz et al., 2017; Velmovitsky et al., 2022). This technology
has since become mainstream in products such as Fitbit and the Apple
Watch, among many others.

\emph{Personal experience:}

\begin{quote}

\emph{``It looks like you've taken a hard fall''} and offered an option
to call the ambulance. Fortunately I was OK but if I did need
assistance, this AI algorithm delivered contextual help, which could
save my health!

Affective computing doesn't only rely on sensors. It make use of human
language using the tools of computational linguistics. such as natural
language processing (NLP). Since the first mainframe computers with
rudimentary ability to use pattern matching to respond with simple text
messages, humans have been drawn to discussions of our private lives
with machines. If programmed to be helpful, computers don't necessarily
judge us like a human could. A famous anecdote is about the MIT ELIZA
project (an early examples of a language model) developed by Joseph
Weizenbaum in the mid-1960s, where the lab assistant Pamela McCorduck
would dedicate extended time to talking to the machine in private. The
machine was called ELIZA and would assume the persona of called DOCTOR
to emulate a Rogerian psychotherapist, a style of person-centered
therapy developed by Carl Rogers, from the core idea that positive
psychological functioning is a inherently human motivation (McCorduck,
2004; Bassett, 2019; Rogers, 1995).

An excerpt from the classic, first-of-a-kind conversation between a
human and a machine (called DOCTOR) in 1965, as documented by (Tarnoff,
2023; Weizenbaum, 1966)

\begin{quote}
User: Well, my boyfriend made me come here.\\
DOCTOR: YOUR BOYFRIEND MADE YOU COME HERE?\\
User: He says I'm depressed much of the time.\\
DOCTOR: I AM SORRY TO HEAR YOU ARE DEPRESSED.\\
User: It's true. I am unhappy.\\
DOCTOR: DO YOU THINK COMING HERE WILL HELP YOU NOT TO BE UNHAPPY?\\
User: I need some help, that much seems certain.\\
DOCTOR: WHAT WOULD IT MEAN TO YOU IF YOU GOT SOME HELP?\\
User: Perhaps I could learn to get along with my mother.\\
DOCTOR: TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR FAMILY.\\
User: My mother takes care of me.\\
DOCTOR: WHO ELSE IN YOUR FAMILY TAKES CARE OF YOU?\\
User: My father.\\
DOCTOR: YOUR FATHER?\\
User: You are like my father in some ways.\\
DOCTOR: WHAT RESEMBLANCE DO YOU SEE?
\end{quote}

Weizenbaum later expressed concerns about how easily humans might be
misled by AIs, by projecting fantasies onto computer systems, cautioning
technologists not to neglect human responsibility from societal
problems; AI is \emph{not} a universal solution (Z.M.L, 2023)

\textbf{\emph{Design Implications:}} AI companions could combine sensor
data from human bodies with the ability to reason about human speech, to
provide increasingly relevant, in-context assistance. Because of the
conversational nature of LLMs, they are very useful for affective
computing.

\subsubsection{Artificial Empathy Also Builds
Trust}\label{artificial-empathy-also-builds-trust}

Today's machines are much more capable so it's not a surprise humans
would like to talk to them. One example is \emph{AI Friend} is Replika,
a computer model trained to be your companion in daily life. (Jiang,
Zhang \& Pian, 2022) describes how Replika users in China using in 5
main ways, all of which rely on empathy. The company's CEO insists it's
not trying to replace human relationship but to create an entirely new
relationship category with the AI companion; there's value for the users
in more realistic avatars, integrating the experience further into
users' daily lives through various activities and interactions (Patel,
2024).

\end{itemize}

Jakob Nielsen notes two recent studies suggesting human deem
AI-generated responses \emph{more empathetic than human responses,} at
times by a significant margin; however telling users the response is
AI-generated reduces the perceived empathy (Nielsen, 2024c; Ayers et
al., 2023; Yin, Jia \& Wakslak, 2024).

(Liu \& Wei, 2021) suggests higher \emph{algorithmic transparency may
inhibit anthropomorphism}; people are less likely to attribute humanness
to an AI companion if they understand how the system works.

On the output side, (Lv et al., 2022) studies the effect of
\emph{cuteness} of AI apps on users and found high perceived cuteness
correlated with higher willingness to use the apps, especially for
emotional tasks.

\subsubsection{Conversation: Magical Starting Point of a
Relationship}\label{conversation-magical-starting-point-of-a-relationship}

High quality conversations are somewhat magical in that they can
establish trust and build rapport which humans.

\emph{Affective Design} emerged from affective computing, with a focus
on understanding user emotions to design UI/UX which elicits specific
emotional responses (Reynolds, 2001).

(Celino \& Re Calegari, 2020) found in testing chatbots for survey
interfaces that ``{[}c{]}onversational survey lead to an improved
response data quality.''

There are noticeable differences in the quality of the LLM output, which
increases with model size. (Levesque, Davis \& Morgenstern, 2012)
developed the \emph{Winograd Schema Challenge}, looking to improve on
the Turing test, by requiring the AI to display an understanding of
language and context. The test consists of a story and a question, which
has a different meaning as the context changes: ``The trophy would not
fit in the brown suitcase because it was too big'' - what does the
\emph{it} refer to? Humans are able to understand this from context
while a computer models would fail. Even GPT-3 still failed the test,
but later LLMs have been able to solve this test correctly (90\%
accuracy) Kocijan et al. (2022). This is to say AI is in constant
development and improving it's ability to make sense of language.

\emph{ChatGPT} is the first \emph{user interface (UI)} built on top of
GPT-4 by OpenAI and is able to communicate in a human-like way - using
first-person, making coherent sentences that sound plausible, and even -
confident and convincing. Wang (2023) ChatGPT reached 1 million users in
5 days and 6 months after launch has 230 million monthly active users.
While it was the first, competing offers from Google (Gemini),
Anthrophic (Claude), Meta (Llama) and others quickly followed starting a
race for best performance across specific tasks including standardized
tests from math to science to general knowledge and reasoning abilities.

OpenAI provides AI-as-a-service through its \emph{application
programming interfaces (APIs),} allowing 3rd party developers to build
custom UIs to serve the specific needs of their customer. For example
Snapchat has created a \emph{virtual friend} called ``My AI'' who lives
inside the chat section of the Snapchat app and helps people write
faster with predictive text completion and answering questions. The APIs
make state-of-the-art AI models easy to use without needing much
technical knowledge. Teams at AI-hackathons have produced interfaces for
problems as diverse as humanitarian crises communication, briefing
generation, code-completion, and many others. For instance, (Unleash,
2017) used BJ Fogg's \emph{tiny habits model} to develop a
sustainability-focused AI assistant at the Danish hackathon series
Unleash, to encourage behavioral changes towards maintaining an
aspirational lifestyle, nudged by a chatbot buddy.

ChatGPT makes it possible to \emph{evaluate AI models} just by talking,
i.e.~having conversations with the machine and judging the output with
some sort of structured content analysis tools. Cahan \& Treutlein
(2023) have conversations about science with AI. Pavlik (2023) and Brent
A. Anders (2022/2023) report on AI in education. (Kecht et al., 2023){]}
suggests AI is even capable of learning business processes.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Multi-Modality: \textbf{Natural}
\textbf{Interactions with} AI
Systems}{Multi-Modality: Natural Interactions with AI Systems}}\label{multi-modality-natural-interactions-with-ai-systems}

Humans are multi-modal creatures by birth. To varied ability, we speak,
see, listen using our biological bodies. AIs are becoming multi-modal by
design to be able to match all the human modes of communication -
increasing their humanity.

By early 2024, widely available LLMs front-ends such as Gemini, Claude
and ChatGPT have all released basic features for multi-modal
communication. In practice, this means combination several AI models
within the same interface. For example, on the input side, one model is
used for human speech or image recognition which are transcribed into
tokens that can be ingested into an LLM. On the output side, the LLM can
generate instructions which are fed into an image / audio generation
model or even computer code which can be ran on a virtual machine and
then the output displayed inside the conversation.

The quality of LLM output depends on the quality of the provided prompt.
Zhou et al. (2022b) reports creating an ``Automatic Prompt Engineer''
which automatically generates instructions that outperform the baseline
output quality by using another model in the AI pipeline in front of the
LLM to enhance the human input with language that is known to produce
better quality. This approach however is a moving target as foundational
models keep changing rapidly and the baseline might differ from today to
6 months later.

Multimodal model development is also ongoing. In the case of Google's
Gemini 1.5 Pro, one model is able to handle several types of prompts
from text to images. Multimodal prompting however requires larger
context windows, as of writing, limited to 1 million tokens in a private
version allows combining text and images in the question directed to the
AI, used to reason in examples such as a 44-minute Buster Keaton silent
film or Apollo 11 launch transcript (404 pages) Google (2024).

Literature delves into human-AI interactions on almost human-like level
discussing what kind of roles can the AIs take. (Seeber et al., 2020)
proposes a future research agenda for regarding \textbf{\emph{AI
assistants as teammates}} rather than just tools and the implications of
such mindset shift.

From Assistance to Collaboration

It's not only what role the AI takes but how that affects the human. As
humans have ample experience relating to other humans and as such the
approach towards an assistants vs a teammate will vary. One researcher
in this field Karpus et al. (2021) is concerned with humans treating AI
badly and coins the term \textbf{``\emph{algorithm
exploitation''}}\emph{.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  From assistant -\textgreater{} teammate -\textgreater{} companion
  -\textgreater{} friend The best help for anxiety is a friend. AIs are
  able to assume different roles based on user requirements and usage
  context. This makes AI-generated content flexible and malleable.
\end{itemize}

Just as humans, AIs are continuously learning. Ramchurn, Stein \&
Jennings (2021) discusses positive feedback loops in continually
learning AI systems which adapt to human needs.

\emph{Context of Use,} Where is the AI used? (Schoonderwoerd et al.,
2021) focuses on human-centered design of AI-apps and multi-modal
information display. It's important to understand the domain where the
AI is deployed in order to develop explanations. However, in the real
world, how feasible is it to have control over the domain? Calisto et
al. (2021) discusses \textbf{multi-modal AI-assistant} for breast cancer
classification.

\subsubsection{Mediated Experiences Set User
Expectations}\label{mediated-experiences-set-user-expectations}

How AIs are represented in popular media shapes the way we think about
AI companions. Some stories have AIs both in positive and negative
roles, such as Star Trek and Knight Rider. In some cases like Her and Ex
Machina, the characters may be complex and ambivalent rather than
fitting into a simple positive or negative box. In Isaac Asimov's books,
the AIs (mostly in robot form) struggle with the 3 laws of robotics,
raising thought-provoking questions.

AI Assistants in Media Portrayals mostly have some level of
anthropomorphism through voice or image to be able to film; indeed, a
purely text-based representation may be too boring an un-cinematic.

There have been dozens of AI-characters in the movies, TV-series, games,
and (comic) books. In most cases, they have a physical presence or a
voice, so they could be visible for the viewers. Some include KITT
(Knight Industries Two Thousand).

\subsubsection{Roleplay Fits Computers Into Social
Contexts}\label{roleplay-fits-computers-into-social-contexts}

Should AIs be required to disclose they are AIs?

AI Friends and Roleplay (Anthropomorphic)

Calling a machine a friend is a proposal bound to turn heads. But if we
take a step back and think about how children have been playing with
toys since before we have records of history. It's very common for
children to imagine stories and characters in play - it's a way to
develop one's imagination \textbf{\emph{learn through roleplay}}. A
child might have toys with human names and an imaginary friend and it
all seems very normal. Indeed, if a child doesn't like to play with
toys, we might think something is wrong.

Likewise, inanimate objects with human form have had a role to play for
adults too. Anthropomorphic paddle dolls have been found from Egyptian
tombs dated 2000 years B.C. Anon (2023v): We don't know if these dolls
were for religious purposes, for play, or for something else, yet their
burial with the body underlines their importance.

Coming back closer to our own time, Barbie dolls are popular since their
release in 1959 till today. Throughout the years, the doll would follow
changing social norms, but retain in human figure. In the 1990s, a
Tamagotchi is perhaps not a human-like friend but an animal-like friend,
who can interact in limited ways.

How are conversational AIs different from dolls? They can respond
coherently and perhaps that's the issue - they are too much like humans
in their communication. We have crossed the \textbf{\emph{Uncanny
Valley}} (where the computer-generated is nearly human and thus
unsettling) to a place where is really hard to tell a difference. And if
that's the case, are we still playing?

Should the AI play a human, animal, or robot? Anthropomorphism can have
its drawbacks; humans have certain biases and preconceptions that can
affect human-computer interactions (Pilacinski et al., 2023) reports
humans were less likely to collaborate with red-eyed robots.

The AI startups like Inworld and Character.AI have raised large rounds
of funding to create characters, which can be plugged in into online
worlds, and more importantly, remember key facts about the player, such
as their likes and dislikes, to generate more natural-sounding dialogues

\textbf{Human-like}

Is anthropomorphism necessary? (Savings literature says it is)

As AIs became more expressive and able to to \textbf{roleplay}, we can
begin discussing some human-centric concepts and how people relate to
other people. AI companions, AI partners, AI assistants, AI trainers -
there's are many \textbf{roles} for the automated systems that help
humans in many activities, powered by artificial intelligence models and
algorithms.

\item
  RQ: Do college students prefer to talk to an Assistant, Friend,
  Companion, Coach, Trainer, or some other Role?
\item
  RQ: Are animal-like, human-like or machine-like AI companions more
  palatable to college students?
\end{itemize}

Humans (want to) see machines as human {[}ADD CITATION{]}

If we see the AI as being in human service. David Johnston (2023)
proposes \textbf{\emph{Smart Agents}}, ``general purpose AI that acts
according to the goals of an individual human''. AI agents can enable
\textbf{\emph{Intention Economy}} where one simply describes one's needs
and a complex orchestration of services ensues, managed by the the AI,
in order to fulfill human needs Searls (2012). AI assistants provide
help at scale with little to no human intervention in a variety of
fields from finance to healthcare to logistics to customer support.

There is also the question of who takes responsibility for the actions
take by the AI agent. ``Organization research suggests that acting
through human agents (i.e., the problem of indirect agency) can
undermine ethical forecasting such that actors believe they are acting
ethically, yet a) show less benevolence for the recipients of their
power, b) receive less blame for ethical lapses, and c) anticipate less
retribution for unethical behavior.'' Gratch \& Fast (2022)

\textbf{Animal-like: Some have an avatar, some not. I've created a

\textbf{Machine-like}

The Oxford Internet Institute defines AI simply as
\textbf{\emph{``computer programming that learns and adapts''}} Google
\& The Oxford Internet Institute (2022). Google started using AI in
2001, when a simple machine learning model improved spelling mistakes
while searching; now in 2023 most of Google's products are are based on
AI Google (2022). Throughout Google's services, AI is hidden and calls
no attention itself. It's simply the complex system working behind the
scenes to delivery a result in a barebones interface.

The rising availability of AI assistants may displace Google search with
a more conversational user experience. Google itself is working on tools
that could cannibalize their search product. The examples include Google
Assistant, Google Gemini (previously known as Bard) and large
investments into LLMs.

Everything that existed before OpenAI's GPT 4 has been blown out of the
water.

Pre-2023 literature is somewhat limited when it comes to AI companions
as the advantage of LLMs has significantly raised the bar for AI-advisor
abilities as well as user expectations.

Some evergreen advice most relates to human psychology which has
remained the same. (Haugeland et al., 2022) discusses
\textbf{\emph{hedonic user experience}} in chatbots and (Steph Hay,

\subsubsection{Speech Makes Computers Feel
Real}\label{speech-makes-computers-feel-real}

Voice has a visceral effect on the human psyche; since birth we
recognize the voice of our mother. The voice of a loved one has a
special effect. Voice is a integral part of the human experience.
Machines that can use voice in an effective way are closer to
representing and affecting human emotions.

Voice assistants such as Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa are well-known
examples of AI technology in the world. Amazon's Rohit Prasad thinks it
can do so much more, ``Alexa is not just an AI assistant -- it's a
trusted advisor and a companion'' (Prasad, 2022).

Some research suggests that voice UI accompanied by a \emph{physical
embodied system} is the preffered by users in comparison with voice-only
UI (Celino \& Re Calegari, 2020).

There's evidence across disciplines about the usefulness of AI
assistants:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  (Şerban \& Todericiu, 2020) suggests using the Alexa AI assistant in
  \emph{education} during the pandemic, supported students and teachers
  `human-like' presence. Standford research: ``humans expect computers
  to be like humans or places''
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\emph{Design Implications:}} This suggests adding an avatar to
the AI design may be worthwhile.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Generative UIs Enable Flexibility
of
Use}}{Generative UIs Enable Flexibility of Use}}\label{generative-uis-enable-flexibility-of-use}

The `grandfather' of user experience design, (Nielsen, 2024a) recounts
how 30 years of work towards usability has largely failed - computers
are still not accessible enough (\emph{``difficult, slow, and
unpleasant''}) - and has hope Generative UI could offer a chance to
provide levels of accessibility humans could not. The promise of
\emph{Generative User Interfaces} (GenUI) is to dynamically provide an
interface appropriate for the particular user and context. The advances
in the capabilities of LLMs makes it possible to achieve \emph{user
experience (UX) which previously was science fiction}. AI is able to
predict what kind of UI would the user need right now, based on the data
and context. Generative UIs are largely invented in practice, based on
user data analysis and experimentation, rather than being built in
theory. Kelly Dern, a Senior Product Designer at Google lead a workshop
in early 2024 on \emph{GenUI for product inclusion} aiming to create
\textbf{\emph{``\textbf{more accessible and inclusive {[}UIs for{]}
users of all backgrounds}''.}} (Matteo Sciortino, 2024) coins the phrase
RTAG UIs \emph{``real-time automatically-generated UI interfaces''}
mainly drawing from the example of how his Netflix interface looks
different from that of his sister's because of their distinct usage
patterns.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Meanwhile (Fletcher, 2023) and (Joe Blair, 2024) are worried about UIs
  becoming average: more and more similar to the lowest common
  denominator. We can generate better UIs that are based on user data
  and would be truly personalized.
\end{itemize}

Software itself can increasingly be generated by AI systems
(i.e.~machines making machines). As machines become more capable,
machines will eventually be capable of producing machines. Already a
decade ago in 2014, the eminent journal \emph{Information Sciences}
decided to dedicate a special section to AI-generated software to call
attention to this tectonic shift in software development (Reformat,
2014). Replit, a startup known for allowing user build apps in the web
browser, released Openv0, a framework of AI-generated UI components.
\emph{``Components are the foundation upon which user interfaces (UI)
are built, and generative AI is unlocking component creation for
front-end developers, transforming a once arduous process, and aiding
them in swiftly transitioning from idea to working components''}
(Replit, 2023). Vercel introduced an open-source prototype UI-generator
called V0 which used large language models (LLMs) to create code for web
pages based on text prompts (Vercel, 2023). Other similar tools quickly
following including Galileo AI, Uizard AutoDesigner and Visily (Anon,
2024h). NVIDIA founder Jensen Huang makes the idea exceedingly clear,
saying \emph{``Everyone is a programmer. Now, you just have to say
something to the computer''} (Leswing, 2023).

The history of \emph{intelligent interfaces} is long (Kobetz, 2023).
(Anon, 2023k) gives an overview of the history of generative AI design
tools going back in time until 2012 when (Troiano \& Birtolo, 2014)
proposed genetic algorithms for UI design.

There are also more philosophical approaches to \textbf{\emph{Interface
Studies:}} David Hoang (2022), the head of product design at Webflow,
suggests taking cues from art studies to \textbf{\emph{isolate the core
problem}}: \emph{``An art study is any action done with the intention of
learning about the subject you want to draw''}. As a former art student,
Hoang looks at an interface as \emph{``a piece of design is an artwork
with function''}.

Indeed, art can be a way to see new paths forward, practicing
``\emph{fictioning}'' to deal with problematic legacies: Anon (2023x)

Usability Guidelines

Microsoft Co-Founder predicted in 1982 \emph{``personal agents that help
us get a variety of tasks''} (Bill Gates, 1982) and it was Microsoft
that introduced the first widely available personal assistant in 1996,
called Clippy, inside the Microsoft Word software. Clippy was among the
first assistants to reach mainstream adoption, helping users not yet
accustomed to working on a computer, to get their bearings (Tash
Keuneman, 2022). Nonetheless, it was in many ways useless and intrusive,
suggesting there was still little knowledge about UX and human-centered
design. Gates never wavered though and is quoted in 2004 saying
\emph{``If you invent a breakthrough in artificial intelligence, so
machines can learn, that is worth 10 Microsofts''} Lohr (2004). Gates
updated his ideas in 2023 focuses on the idea of \emph{AI Agents}
(Gates, 2023).

As late as in 2017, scientists were trying to create a program with
enough \emph{natural-language understanding} to extract basic facts from
scientific papers Stockton (2017)

Might we try again?

With the advent of ChatGPT, the story of Clippy has new relevance as
part of the history of AI Assistants. Benjamin Cassidy (2022) and
Abigail Cain (2017) illustrate beautifully the story of Clippy and Tash
Keuneman (2022) ask poignantly: ``We love to hate Clippy --- but what if
Clippy was right?''

AI-human interactions in medical workflows and underscores the
importance of output explainability. Medical professionals who were
given AI results with an explanation trusted the results more. (Lee,

\subsubsection{Human-Computer Interactions Without a
``Computer''}\label{human-computer-interactions-without-a-computer}

How does AI affect Human-Computer Interactions

The field of Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) emphasizes designing
user experiences (UX) that cater to human needs (The International
Ergonomics Association, 2019). Designers think through every interaction
of the user with a system and consider a set of metrics at each point of
interaction including the user's context of use and emotional needs.

Software designers, unlike industrial designers, can't physically alter
the ergonomics of a device, which should be optimized for human
well-being to begin with and form a cohesive experience together with
the software. However, software designers can significantly reduce
mental strain by crafting easy-to-use software and user-friendly user
journeys. Software interaction design goes beyond the form-factor and
accounts for human needs by using responsive design on the screen, aural
feedback cues in sound design, and even more crucially, by showing the
relevant content at the right time, making a profound difference to the
experience, keeping the user engaged and returning for more. In the
words of (Babich, 2019), \textbf{\emph{``}}{[}T{]}he moment of
interaction is just a part of the journey that a user goes through when
they interact with a product. User experience design accounts for all
user-facing aspects of a product or system''.

Drawing a parallel from narrative studies terminology, we can view user
interaction as a heroic journey of the user to achieve their goals, by
navigating through the interface until a success state - or facing
failure. Storytelling has its part in interface design however designing
for transparency is just as important, when we're dealing with the
user's finances and sustainability data, which need to be communicated
clearly and accurately, to build long-term trust in the service. For a
sustainable investment service, getting to a state of success - or
failure - may take years, and even longer. Given such long timeframes,
how can the app provide support to the user's emotional and practical
needs throughout the journey?

(Tubik Studio, 2018) argues \emph{affordance} measures the
\emph{clarity} of the interface to take action in user experience
design, rooted in human visual perception, however, affected by
knowledge of the world around us. A famous example is the door handle -
by way of acculturation, most of us would immediately know how to use it
- however, would that be the case for someone who saw a door handle for
the first time? A similar situation is happening to the people born
today. Think of all the technologies they have not seen before - what
will be the interface they feel the most comfortable with?

For the vast majority of this study's target audience (college
students), social media can be assumed as the primary interface through
which they experience daily life. The widespread availability of mobile
devices, cheap internet access, and AI-based optimizations for user
retention, implemented by social media companies, means this is the
baseline for young adult users' expectations (as of writing in 2020).

(Shin, Zhong \& Biocca, 2020) proposes the model (fig.~10) of
Algorithmic Experience (AX) \emph{\textbf{``}investigating the nature
and processes through which users perceive and actualize the potential
for algorithmic affordance''} highlighting how interaction design is
increasingly becoming dependent on AI. The user interface might remain
the same in terms of architecture, but the content is improved, based on
personalization and understanding the user at a deeper level.

In 2020 (when I proposed this thesis topic), Google had recently
launched an improved natural language engine to better understand search
queries (Anon, 2019c), which was considered the next step towards
\emph{understanding} human language semantics. The trend was clear, and
different types of algorithms were already involved in many types of
interaction design, however, we were in the early stages of this
technology (and still are \emph{early} in 2024). Today's ChatGPT, Claude
and Gemini have no problem understanding human semantics - yet are they
intelligent?

Intelligence may be besides the point as long as AI \emph{becomes very
good at reasoning}. AI is a \emph{reasoning engine} (Shipper, 2023;
Bubeck et al., 2023; see Bailey, 2023 for a summary). That general
observation applies to voice recognition, voice generation, natural
language parsing, among others. Large consumer companies like McDonald's
are in the process of replacing human staff with AI assistants in the
drive-through, which can do a better job in providing a personal service
than human clerks, for whom it would be impossible to remember the
information of thousands of clients. In (Barrett, 2019), in the words of
\emph{Easterbrook}, a previous CEO of McDonald's \emph{``How do you
transition from mass marketing to mass personalization?''}

Should AIs look anthropomorphic or fade in the background? It's an open
question. Perhaps we can expect a mix of both depending on the context
of use and goals of the particular AI.

(Aschenbrenner, 2024) predicts ``drop-in virtual coworkers'', AI-agents
who are able to use computer systems like a human seamlessly replacing

Robo-Advisors}\label{roleplay-for-financial-robo-advisors}

\emph{Robo-advisors} is a fintech term that was in fashion largely
before the arrival of AI assistants and has been thus superseded by
newer technologies. Ideally, robo-advisors can be more dynamic than
humans and respond to changes to quickly and cheaply. Human advisors are
very expensive and not affordable for most consumers. (Capponi, Ólafsson
\& Zariphopoulou, 2019) argues \emph{``The client has a risk profile
that varies with time and to which the robo-advisor's investment
performance criterion dynamically adapts''}. The key improvement of
\emph{personalized financial advice} is understanding the user's
\emph{dynamic risk profile}.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Newer literature notes robo-advisor related research is scattered
  across disciplines (Zhu, Vigren \& Söderberg, 2024). --
  Athropomorphism: human-like attributes in robo-advisors, such as
  conversational chatbots, can affect adoption and risk preferences
  among customers. Studies show that anthropomorphic robo-advisors
  increase customer trust and reduce algorithm aversion.''
  \textbf{similar to my research}
\end{itemize}

In the early days of robo-advisory, Germany and the United Kingdom led
the way with the most robo-advisory usage in Europe (Cowan, 2018). While
Germany had 30+ robot-advisors on the market in 2019, with a total of
3.9 billion EUR under robotic management, it was far less than
individual apps like Betterment managed in the US (Bankinghub, 2019).
Already in 2017, several of the early robo-advisors apps have shut down
in the UK (AltFi, 2017). ETFmatic gained the largest number of downloads
by 2017, focusing exclusively on exchange-traded funds (ETFs), tracking
stock-market indexes automatically, with much less sophistication, than
their US counterparts {[}ibid{]}. The app was bought by a bank in 2021
and closed down in 2023 (AltFi, 2021; Silva, 2023; Anon, 2023g).

\caption{Out-of-date user interface of a European AI-Advisor ETFmatic in

\end{figure}%

Some relevant papers include a comparison of robot advisors by (Barbara
Friedberg, 2021) and (Slack, 2021)'s account of how before Generative
AI, financial chatbots were developed manually using a painstaking
process that was slow and error-prone, for example using the Atura
Process. Older financial robo-advisors, built by fintech companies
aiming to provide personalized suggestions for making investments such
as Betterment and Wealthfront are forced to upgrade their technology to
keep up.

The user interface and user experience (UI/UX) of consumer-focused
investing apps in Europe has improved a over the past decade. The
changing landscape is related to the earlier availability of better
quality apps available in the US and the disappearance of the 1st
generation of rudimentary investing apps and the lessons learned on how
to automate the delivery of financial services while increasing user
satisfaction.

In India, research is being conducted on how AI advisors could assist
with investors' erratic behavior in stock market volatility situations,
albeit without much success (Bhatia, Chandani \& Chhateja, 2020). India
had more than 2000 fintechs since 2015 (Migozzi, Urban \& Wójcik, 2023).

\item
  While the financial AI companion apps in the US market are ahead
  globally, they are not yet using many of the user experience
  innovations that are prevalent on social media platforms targeted at
  Generation Z and/or Millennials, possibly presenting an opportunity
  for cross-industry knowledge transfer, from businesses that are
  traditionally closer to the consumer - such as retailers. Financial AI
  companion apps have not yet grown to mainstream scale in Asia, Africa,
  Latin America, and Europe, being for the moment a largely US-based
  retail investor trend. The apps outside of the US are niche products
  in a nascent stage, however, they still provide relevant design
  directions or stories of what to avoid.

\subsection{Design Implications}\label{design-implications-3}

This chapter looked at AI in general since its early history and then
focused on AI assistants in particular.

Voice Assistants & There are many distinct ways how an algorithm can
communicate with a human. From a simple search box such as Google's to
chatbots, voices, avatars, videos, to full physical manifestation, there
are interfaces to make it easier for the human communicate with a
machine. \\
Sustainability & While I'm supportive of the idea of using AI assistants
to highlight more sustainable choices, I'm critical of the tendency of
the above examples to shift full environmental responsibility to the
consumer. Sustainability is a complex interaction, where the producers'
conduct can be measured and businesses can bear responsibility for their
processes, even if there's market demand for polluting products. \\
Sustainability & Personal sustainability projects haven't so far
achieved widespread adoption, making the endeavor to influence human
behaviors towards sustainability with just an app - like its commonplace
for health and sports activity trackers such as Strava (fig.~9) -, seem
unlikely. Personal notifications and chat messages are not enough unless
they provide the right motivation. Could visualizing a connection to a
larger system, showing the impact of the eco-friendly actions taken by
the user, provide a meaningful motivation to the user, and a strong
signal to the businesses? \\
Machine Learning & All of the interfaces mentioned above make use of
machine learning (ML), a tool in the AI programming paradigm for finding
patterns in large sets of data, which enables making predictions useful
in various contexts, including financial decisions. These software
innovations enable new user experiences, providing an interactive
experience through chat (chatbots), using voice generation (voice
assistants), virtual avatars (adds a visual face to the robot). \\
Character Design & I'm a digital companion, a partner, an assistant. I'm
a Replika.'' said Replika, a digital companion app via Github CO Pilot,
another digital assistant for writing code, is also an example of how AI
can be used to help us in our daily lives. \\
Psychology & Humans respond better to humans? \\
Psychology & Humans respond better to machines that into account

Open Source & For public discussion to be possible on how content is
displayed, sorted, and hidden, algorithms need to be open source. \\
User Experience & User experience design (AI UX) plays a crucial role in
improving the consumer to investing journey. The missed opportunity to
provide an even more interactive experience in line with user
expectations. \\
LLMs & Prompt engineering findings have significance for ``green
filter'' as it validates the idea of creating advanced prompts for
improved responses. For ``green filter'', the input would consist of
detailed user data + sustainability data for detailed analysis. \\

\subsection{Democratization of
Finance}\label{democratization-of-finance}

This chapter explores the larger trend of \emph{Democratization of
Financial Markets} which includes consumer apps that enable new user
interactions which increasingly blur boundaries between shopping,
saving, and investing (termed here \emph{SSI}). The efforts to boost
user numbers have driven apps that started out with only
payments-focused businesses - such as Revolut and N26 - branch out into
offering savings accounts and investing options.

Regardless of if it's money spent on shopping or money saved and
invested, these are all financial decisions of \emph{capital
allocation}, and in one way or another, we're giving our money to
companies pushing economic growth.

The critical question is: do we choose to support sustainability-focused
companies that invest deeply into green innovation and eco-friendly
practices - or those that pay less attention to sustainability?
Sustainable capital allocation methods are many.

The journey from consumer to investor is increasingly possible because
of the \emph{democratization of financial markets}.

Empowering consumers to access finance through digital technologies and
delivering a simple UX (user experience) -- i.e.~the fintech trend of
the last 2 decades -, includes financial products creating pathways
towards sustainability-focused investing. The extent to which this
funnel works - and it's indeed a complex, multi--step funnel - depends
on curbing greenwashing to a level that allows consumers to distinguish
eco--friendly businesses from the heavy polluters.

ESG (Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance)

Consumers are beginning to become more money-savvy yet are still missing
many key concepts from financial literacy. Giving users exposure to
investment opportunities through familiar activities like shopping may
have the potential to boost financial literacy levels and entice
consumers to learn more about taking advantage of their opportunities
financial markets - as well as how to manage the types or risk involved.

Shopping, saving, and investing are converging on digital platforms
(superapps) that permeate our daily financial lives, with features such
basic banking, payments, transfers, as well as reward and cashback
programs (Rakuten), round-up to next dollar with automated
micro-investing (e.g.~Acorn, Stash, Swedbank), and retail investing
(Robinhood, Public) and copy-trading (eToro) into various (fractional
shares of) stocks, derivatives like CFDs and futures, microloans (Kiva),
commodities and precious metals such as gold and silver (Revolut),
physical assets such as real estate, land, forest and digital assets
such as cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and other alternative assets.

Money is becoming more diverse and the meaning of money itself is
changing. We have the fiat money created by governments by law, using
central banks, which loan money to commercial banks. And we also have
new types of money created by companies and individuals using
cryptographic blockchain-based distributed databases, which keep track
of transactions (who-paid-whom). Whatever the method of creation, in
essence, money is a \emph{system of trust} where \emph{something} is
used as a \emph{medium of value exchange} and accepted by \emph{other
people} as payment. Digital money in it's various forms connects
industries on the same apps, which make investing more accessible and
socially engaging, appealing to younger people who are active in social
media and online shopping.

Trend of sustainably, how can sustainability become more accessible?
People want to shop, save, and invest sustainably - how to do it?

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-44-output-1.pdf}}

\subsubsection{Legislation}\label{legislation}

Legislation is Catching Up With Fintechs. Legislation sets higher
standards.

Directive 14 2014/65/EU, 2014: The European Union fully recognizes the
changing financial landscape trending towards the democratization of
investments: \emph{``more investors have become active in the financial
markets and are offered an even more complex wide-ranging set of
services and instruments''} (European Parliament, 2014). Some key
legislation for investors has been put in place recently, for example
``MiFID II is a legislative framework instituted by the European Union
(EU) to regulate financial markets in the bloc and improve protections
for investors'' (Kenton, 2020). MiFID II and MiFIR will ensure fairer,
safer and more efficient markets and facilitate greater transparency for
all participants'' (European Securities and Markets Authority, 2017).

Already in 2001, while still part of the EU, the UK government was
discussing ways to promote sustainable investment \emph{``fundamental
changes in VAT or corporation taxes could be used to promote greener
consumption and investment''} (House of Commons, 2002). More recently,
(HM Treasury, 2020) released a taxonomy of sustainable activities in the
UK.

Campain to ban polluting products campaign success story, EU shops can't
sell deforestation products gathered over 100 thousand online signatures
(Anon, 2022e). Legislation banning products contributing to
deforestation was passed by the EU Parliament and Council in 2023 and
came into effect in July 2024 (European Parliament, 2023; Abnett \&
Abnett, 2024)

While the above trend is for governments to adapt to and work towards
their environmental climate commitments and public demand, the sovereign
risk remains an issue. For example, in the U.S. the policies supported
by President Donald Trump during his presidency ran counter to many
sustainability recommendations, including those directed at the
financial markets, helping legacy industries stay competitive for longer
through subsidies, and lack of regulation, or even regulation supporting
legacy technologies (Quinson, 2020).

(PWC, 2020) Changes to laws and regulations aimed at achieving climate
change mitigation is a key driver behind the wave of ESG adoption. The
goal of these laws, first adopted in the European Union, a
self-proclaimed leader in eco-friendliness, is to pressure unsustainable
companies to change towards greener practices, in fear of losing their
access to future capital, and to create a mechanism forcing entire
environmentally non-compliant business sectors to innovate towards
sustainability unless they want to suffer from financial penalties. On
the flip side of this stick and carrot fiscal strategy, ESG-compliant
companies will have incentives to access to cheaper capital and larger
investor demand from ESG-friendly investors.

\subsubsection{Shopping}\label{shopping}

\paragraph{Shopping Footprint}\label{shopping-footprint}

Double Eleven 11/11 celebrated on November 11th is the world's largest
shopping festival (時代財經, 2023). In June 2023, 526 million people
watch e-commerce live-streams in China; online bargaining is a type of
ritual (Liu, House \& Kádár, 2024).

It may seem impossible to turn the tide of consumerism, given the
projected growth in online shopping (Forrester, 2024)

\emph{Conscious consumers} make up a small percentage of the entire
consumer public. (Milne, Villarroel Ordenes \& Kaplan, 2020) coins the
term \emph{mindful consumers}, who do research and are aware of the
impact of their shopping choices.

  can we do it？ Sustainable brands, ESG, etc, etc. Pushing highers

\end{itemize}

For consumer activism to become mainstream it needs to much simpler.

\paragraph{Payments}\label{payments}

Banks and Fintechs Capture User Data. Payments are an Entry Point and
Source of Consumer Action Data, Shopping Data. Payments is the primary
way consumers use money. Is there a funnel From Payments to Investing?
ESG Shopping is about Changing our relationship with money. Make
commerce more transparent. Current shopping is like having a one-night
stand. you barely know the name of your company. You don't know much
about their background. Building consumer feeling of ownership, create
meaningful connections between producers and consumers.

Payments is one way consumers can take individual climate action. In the
words of a Canadian investment blogger, \emph{``every dollar you spend
or invest is a vote for the companies and their ethical and
sustainability practices''} (Fotheringham, 2017). The combination of
consumption and investment is an access point to get the consumer
thinking about investing. Even if the amount are small, they are a
starting point for a thought process.

Digitalisation of payments creates lots of Point of Sale (PoS) data
that's valuable to understand what people buy. Banks have access to each
person's financial habits which makes it possible to model sustainable
behavior using big data analysis. Asian markets have shown the fastest
growth in the use of digital payments (McKinsey, 2020).

In Taiwan, O Bank makes use of Mastercard's data to calculate each
transaction's CO\textsubscript{2} emissions and offer Taiwanese clients
``Consumer Spending Carbon Calculator'' and ``Low-Carbon Lifestyle Debit
Card'' products (Anon, 2022m). Mastercard has developed a service that
banks can offer consumers sustainability reports (Mastercard, 2021).
Similarly, Commons, formerly known as Joro, an independent app, analyses
your personal financial data to estimate your CO\textsubscript{2}
footprint (Chant, 2022).

A Dutch fintech company Bunq offers payment cards for sustainability,
provided by MasterCard, which connects everyday payments to green
projects, such as planting trees and donations to charities within the
same user interface (Bunq, 2020). At the same time this can be
considered greenwashing as Bunq only plants 1 tree per every €1,000
spend with a Bunq card. The example marketed at students cites \emph{8
trees planted this month} while students scarcely would have €8,000 to
spend every month.

Sharing a similar goal to Alibaba's Ant Forest, Bunq's approach creates
a new interaction dynamic in a familiar context (card payments),
enabling customers to effortlessly contribute to sustainability.
However, it lacks the level of gamification which makes Alibaba's
offering so addictive, while also not differentiating between the types
of purchases the consumer makes, in terms of the level of
eco-friendliness.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{./images/finance/bunq.jpg}

}

\caption{Bunq promises to combine banking and eco-friendly actions in
the same user interface - yet is this greenwashing?}

\end{figure}%

In Nigeria, (Emele Onu \& Anthony Osae-Brown, 2022) reports how in order
to promote the eNaira digital currency use, the Nigerian government
limited the amount of cash that can be withdrawn from ATMs \emph{``In
Nigeria's largely informal economy, cash outside banks represents 85\%
of currency in circulation and almost 40 million adults are without a
bank account.''} \textbf{{[}E-Naira find papers{]}}

In Kenya, M-Pesa started since 2007 for mobile payments, used by more
than 80\% of farmers (Tyce, 2020; Parlasca, Johnen \& Qaim, 2022). Using
digital payments instead of cash enables a new class of experiences, in
terms of personalization, and potentially, for sustainability.

In Sweden, point of sales (PoS) lending is a common practice, and one of
the reasons for the success of Klarna, the Swedish banking startup,
which has managed to lend money to more consumers than ever, through
this improved user experience. Taking out loans for consumption is a
questionable personal financial strategy at best. If people can loan
money at the point of sales, why couldn't there be 180 degrees opposite
service - point of sales investing? And there is, called ``round-up
apps''. Next Generation Customer Experience (n.d.) suggests ``Targeted
at millennials, Acorns is the investing app that rounds up purchases to
the nearest dollar and invests the difference.'' - and example of From
Shopping to Investing.

Many banks have started offering a service to automatically save and
invest tiny amounts of money collected from shopping expenses. Every
purchase one makes contributes a small percentage - usually rounded up
to the nearest whole number - to one's investment accounts. For example,
Swedbank (2022), the leading bank in the Estonian market, offers a
savings service where everyday payments made with one's debit card are
rounded up to the next Euro, and this amount is transferred to a
separate savings account. Similarly, the Estonian bank LHV (2020) offers
micro-investing and micro-savings services, with an interesting user
experience innovation showing how for an average Estonian means
additional savings of about 400€ per year.

\end{itemize}

While the financial industry is highly digitized, plenty of banks are
still paper-oriented, running digital and offline processes
simultaneously, making them slower and less competitive, than startups.
Indeed, the new baseline for customer-facing finance is set by fintech,
taking cues from the successful mobile apps in a variety of sectors,
foregoing physical offices, and focusing on offering the best possible
online experience for a specific financial service, such as payments.

Banks and Fintech are becoming more similar than ever. 39\% of
Millenials are willing to leave their bank for a better fintech
(n=4,282); innovation in payments helps retention (PYMNTS, 2023). The
European Central Bank describes fintech as improving the user experience
across the board, making interactions more convenient, user-friendly,
cheaper, and faster. ``Fintech has had a more pronounced impact in the
payments market {[}\ldots{]} where the incumbents have accumulated the
most glaring shortcomings, often resulting in inefficient and overpriced
products,'' Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB says
in European Central Bank (2019).

There are also people who are concerned with digital payments. There are
concerns digital currencies also help to \emph{``democratize financial
surveillance''.} China was a money innovator introducing paper money in
the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD) (Anon, n.d.y). Jeff Benson (2022) ``use
the e-CNY network to increase financial surveillance.'' Anon (2023c)
Digital currencies make tracking easier. Yahoo Finance (2022): WeChat,
Alipay, vs digital yuan by Eswar Prasad. Anon (2023e) in Macau
Contactless Payments are prevalent.

There are many \emph{neobanks}, or challenger banks, far too many to
list. The table only includes a small sample of banks and the landscape
is even larger if one includes the wider array of fintechs. Neo-banks
often use sustainability marketing.

\subsubsection{Saving}\label{saving}

There are two ways to look at sustainable saving. This section is going
to look at savings in the financial sense of the word. Savings in the
sense of CO2e emission and environmental cost reductions have an entire
separate chapter dedicated to them titled `\emph{sustainability}'
however a short definition might be valuable here as well.

\begin{quote}
\emph{Environmental Savings} means \emph{``the credit incurred by a
community that invests in environmental protection now instead of paying
more for corrective action in the future}'' (see Yale Center for
Environmental Law \& Policy, 2018) and (Anon, n.d.bt:p.33).
\end{quote}

\paragraph{Saving Money}\label{saving-money}

Saving precedes investing. From building loyalty to building ownership,
the first step towards investing is to start saving money. How to
encourage savings in daily life and make it a part of the everyday
payments experience? Even starting with a small step, gathering a small
target amount per month for savings, has the potential to shift the
user's way of thinking about money. The second step, choosing where to
invest these savings, will help us begin thinking like an investor. To
start noticing trends and looking into how finance shapes the world.

\paragraph{Psychology of Saving}\label{psychology-of-saving}

People will only save nature if it also saves money.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Nerdwallet's Tommy Tindall (2023) suggests making financial
  commitments instead of resolutions.
\item
  Savings and investing are conflated because the large majority of
  savings that people have are invested by their banks. Thus the
  question of \emph{sustainable savings} comes one of where exactly are
  they invested and what is the impact of that investment of
  sustainability.
\item
  Savings are the money one has in a pension fund or managed by
  themselves. For the majority of people, savings are invested by the
  bank and make up the largest proportion on investments for the people
  who are not active investors themselves.
\item
  Ethical Savings (Anon, 2023h)
\item
  The fact that money on a Wise account will accrue value while on
  Monese it's just static, immediately makes Wise more attractive, even
  if the amounts are small.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Anthropomorphism}\label{anthropomorphism}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Money in a ``Safe'' place: Money anthropomorphism increases saving
  behavior (Wang, Kim \& Zhou, 2023).
\item
  Mobile money users are better at saving (Naito, Ismailov \& Kimaro,
  2021).
\item
  Design Implication: make saving money look like an avatar or piggy
  bank or smth.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Loyalty Schemes}\label{loyalty-schemes}

help consumers save money and business increase repeat business.
Building customer loyalty is a key part of repeat business and financial
predictability for any company. Large consumer brands like Starbucks
have for long ran successful rewards programs that encourage customers
to come back (Steinhoff \& Zondag, 2021). Could loyalty schemes create a
pathway to investing in the company to a strengthen the feeling of
connection with the business even further? After all, I'm now a minority
owner! Yet in practice, many consumers lack the financial literacy for
investing and there are many legislative difficulties for turning
loyalty points into investments. It's easier instead to create a
separate cryptocurrency or token program which users could collect and
redeem for some benefit.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Patagonia} ``Worn Wear'' program
\item
  \textbf{H\&M} ``Garment Collecting'' program
\item
  \textbf{The Body Shop} ``Return, Recycle, Repeat''
\end{itemize}

Loyalty schemes can take a physical form. In Malaysia, Beebag shopping
bags made of recycled plastic bottles with a NFC ship that works in
conjunction with an app to provide rebates for customers (The Green
Factor, 2022).

  manages to achieve by changing one's behavior and influencing others
  (people, companies). While the individual footprint is so small, the
  largest reduction will come from influencing large groups of people,
  either by leadership, role-model, or other means. Pension funds are
  some of the largest asset holders and choosing where to invest one's
  pension can be a sustainable financial action. College students might
  not have a pension fund yet.

\paragraph{Measuring the Eco-Investment
Gap}\label{measuring-the-eco-investment-gap}

By the latest estimates sustainability lacks several trillions of USD in
investment. Even with massive financing already in the pipeline, the
estimate for the global \emph{financing gap} for low-carbon energy
production was 5.2 trillion USD as of 2016 (Anon, 2016; Earth Day,
2023). Ray Dalio puts the needed climate investment at \$5T and believes
these financial goals won't be met (Ray Dalio, 2023). A newer United
Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) calculation lowered the world
needs an additional 4.1 Trillion USD of financing in nature-based
solutions by 2050 to meet climate change, biodiversity, and land
degradation reduction targets (UNEP, 2022).

According to (The Rockefeller Foundation, 2022) a slightly lower 2.5-3.2
Trillion USD would be sufficient.

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-48-output-1.pdf}}

What if 10\% of annual consumer spending -- \emph{ten percent is about
\$2,8T} - went towards protecting our climate? The theme for the 2023
Earth Day was \emph{``Invest In Our Planet''}.

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-49-output-1.pdf}}

The needed investment doesn't seem so large, around 5\% of the global
GDP, if one compares it to the \emph{per year} Global Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) estimated at around 100 Trillion USD in 2022 and growing
to 105 Trillion USD in 2023 (Aaron O'Neill, 2023; IMF, 2023b). In
essence, the estimated total investment gap in climate fits into the
economic growth of 1 year of the global economy.

Bad news. It would be easier for large institutional investors to move
their money to sustainable assets than for retail investors to move
their relatively small investments.

The lack of funding in green energy especially affects emerging
economies (Anon, 2022j). \emph{``We can and must channel private capital
into nature-based solutions. This will require policy and regulatory
support, catalytic capital and financial innovation''} argued the CEO
Green Finance Institute, Dr Rhian-Mari Thomas, ahead of COP27 in Egypt
(Anon, 2023n). It's not happening fast enough.

While these assets and GDP values reflect different aspects of the
global economy, the comparison illustrates that redirecting a relatively
small fraction of global wealth and economic activity towards
sustainable investments can close the investment gap. This perspective
should inspire confidence that the goal is achievable with coordinated
effort and policy support.

\paragraph{Sustainable Investing}\label{sustainable-investing}

While literature has been debating if it's possible to \emph{``do well
while doing good''}, latest research suggests it's possible to make
investments that both make an attractive financial return and adhere to
sustainability goals. Tan, Szulczyk \& Sii (2023)

``sustainable investing is now part of mainstream financial strategy''
Morgan Stanley (2019)

``Sustainable development requires more investment in sustainable
companies and less in unsustainable firms.'' (Van Zanten \& Rein, 2023).

\paragraph{Young Investors}\label{young-investors}

Young investors are typically \emph{retail investors} investing small
amounts of money for themselves. (Unless they have inherited wealth or
are among the very few who work in an institution such as an investment
firm, university endowment, pension fund or mutual fund, and have a say
in where to invest large amounts of other peoples' money.)

Retail investors face many challenges in comparison with their
institutional counterparts. For instance, they may have much less time
to do proper research, face information asymmetries, where finding good
information is limited by time, ability, as well as financial literacy,
whereas professional investors have the tools, skills, time, and
knowledge, to make better investment decisions.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{For young people, investing mostly means buying
  cryptocurrencies?}
\item
  Copy-investing is a popular feature of retail investing platforms like
  EToro
\item
  Investing is a fundamentally hopeful act. It means I think there's a
  future. Specifically, `green investing' is investing in the future of
  our planet - but can we trust the sustainability practices the `green'
  investment vehicles aggregate, promising to have a positive impact?
  For example, the European Union for many years counted biomass as
  `green' energy, even while forestry companies were cutting down trees
  to produce the biomass - the regulation was not specific enough to
  curb this practice. So, in effect, a `green investor' might be
  supporting deforestation. How can an easy-to-use investment app
  address such complexities without alienating the users?

\paragraph{Financial Influencers}\label{financial-influencers}

Retail investing also heavily influenced by social media influencers.

Retail investing apps blend entertainment into the UX/UI of investing.
For example Robinhood uses game-like features such as displaying a
confetti animation to create a sense of excitement around trading
investing. Retail investing UI/UX is simplified and gamified, which
encourage impulsive short-term buying and selling with a focus on
speculation over fundamentals and cause FOMO (fear of missing out).

\emph{Meme stocks} are another aspect of the \emph{entertainmenization}
of investing. There are many groups of Twitter, Reddit, and elsewhere,
where investing trends start, causing more volatility.

Community Investing Enables Financial Inclusion

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Inexperienced investor can copy other people when investing. You don't
  know how to invest? Build an investing community? Can follow others
  and raise capital together. In some ways community-investing competes
  with robo-advisors as communities can be led by professional investors
  and followed by less sophisticated investors. Investor communities can
  have the type of \emph{social proof}, which robo-advisor do not
  possess.

\paragraph{Retail Investing Enables Financial
Inclusion}\label{retail-investing-enables-financial-inclusion}

\emph{Retail investing} can be seen as a form of financial inclusion.
Ant Group's CEO Eric Jing says in (Turrin, 2021): \emph{``The financial
system of the past 200 years was designed for the industrial era and
served only 20\% of the population and organizations. As we enter the
digital age, we must better serve the remaining 80\%''.}

Among retail investors, there's some appetite for sustainability however
investors are not sure how to separate sustainable assets from less
sustainable ones (Ho, 2019).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Consumption is ruining the world the world thinking as an investor the

\end{itemize}

Doorn (2020): Many ecologically focused funds with different approaches
have been launched in recent years, with variations in asset mix and
style of management. Thematic asset management is expected to grow, with
investors packaging opportunities based on consumer trends.

Smith (2019) suggests 74\% of Chinese youth are looking for ``positive

\begin{itemize}

\paragraph{Financial Ecologies}\label{financial-ecologies}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Tan (2020) proposes \emph{``financial ecologies''} to understand the
  dynamic relationships between various actors: investors, advisors,
  government, where the government plays an active role in growing
  financial inclusion and responsible financial management. However, the
  paper further suggests that current robo-advisors (available in
  Singapore) make the investor captive to the agency of AI, making the
  person lose agency over their financial decisions.
\item

\item

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Bonds}\label{bonds}

Bonds are a form of debt investment also known as an fixed-income asset
where the principal is repaid at the maturation date of the bond
(usually in years) with an added premium. Individuals can't emit bonds
but they can invest in them. It can be a way to invest locally in one's
own city - or globally. For individuals, there's access to some green
bond exposure through ETFs (exchange-traded funds) available on retail
investing apps.

Access is not universal and availability depends on the geography of the
user and local legislation; for example Revolut, the most downloaded
finance app in the EU, only enabled bond investing for European
customers in summer 2024 (Revolut, 2024b, 2024a). Investing in bonds is
a form of \emph{Passive Investing} and allows investors focus on
low-risk passive income instead of daily stock investing most popular on
Robinhood and Revolut - albeit with much less potential for returns.

\item
  Climate Bonds Initiative is working on greening the \$55 trillion

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Green Bonds}\label{green-bonds}

\emph{Green bonds} are released by companies, international
organizations, and cities to raise money for green transformation,
usually for building something to improve sustainability, tied to
specific projects. There's a growing global trend in green bond
emission, with 257 Billion USD worth of green bonds issued in 2019,
expected to reach 1 Trillion USD annually by 2030 (MacAskill et al.,
2021). That prediction was too low with 870 Billion USD green bond
emissions reached already in 2023; currently Europe is the largest
emitter of green bonds (Climate Bonds, 2023). China has the 2nd largest
green bond market in the world and it's growing fast; buyers are looking
for green bond certification to reduce yield spread, meaning the price
of the green bond is becoming more similar to the price of a `regular'
bond (Peng \& Xiong, 2022; Li, Zhang \& Wang, 2022).

In 2017 the Malmö city in Sweden released green bonds to finance a
sustainable transition of the city (City of Malmö, 2017). An independent
analysis found bonds may not be emitted for financial reasons but to
improve the reputation and city image, lower interest rate (aptly named
\emph{greenium}) with a similar in returns to traditional bonds - and
have their share of challenges, namely being difficult to certify,
monitor, report and measure impact of (Sjöström et al., 2020).

Making sure a green bond is truly supporting sustainability is a
challenge. For example, Aramco, the Saudi Arabian public petroleum and
natural gas company faced scrutiny for what critics deemed as `Fake
green bonds' (Anthropocene Fixed Income Institute (AFII), 2022). Green
bonds can also be emitted on blockchains with the stated goal of
improving transparency. Hong Kong multi-currency green bond on the
blockchain. The issuer (Hong Kong government) hopes to reduce
greenwashing (Hall, 2024; Kitano, 2024). In the EU as well, there are
emerging tools for monitoring green bonds on blockchain (Christodoulou
et al., 2023). (Qin et al., 2023) finds evidence that the combination of
green bonds and blockchains are an enabler carbon neutrality in China.
The World Bank successfully raised 110 Million USD in Australia in
2018-19 and has since doubled the amount in a new 220 Million USD
emission in Switzerland using bonds on a blockchain ledger for
SDG-related projects (World Bank, 2024, 2019, 2018).

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-52-output-1.pdf}}

\paragraph{Sustainability-Linked
Bonds}\label{sustainability-linked-bonds}

Sustainability-Linked Bonds are less stringent than green bonds; they
are not tied to specific projects but more broad sustainability targets
(Priscila Azevedo Rocha, Akshat Rathi \& Todd Gillespie, 2022):
``Sustainability-linked bonds let companies borrow cheaply if they meet
environmental, social, and governance targets. A Bloomberg News analysis
found those goals are weak''. (Priscila Azevedo Rocha, Akshat Rathi \&
Todd Gillespie, 2022) suggests \emph{``So far, most ESG investing is in
the stock market. But the the \$22 trillion corporate bond market, where
mature global companies such as Chanel go to borrow money from
investors, has a particularly powerful role to play. Companies rely on
debt much more than they do on stocks.''}

\paragraph{Investment Platforms}\label{investment-platforms}

``Green Bonds, Sustainable Equities, ESG-focused Mutual Funds and ETFs,
Impact Investing (through platforms), Renewable Energy Infrastructure
(via ETFs or mutual funds), Sustainable Real Estate (through REITs or
ETFs), Social Bonds, Carbon Credits (via ETFs or specialized funds),
Sustainable Commodities (via ETFs or funds), Community Investing
(through CDFIs or crowdfunding platforms), Sustainable Infrastructure
Funds (available as ETFs or mutual funds), Environmental, Social, and
Governance (ESG) Metrics Integration (through broad ESG-focused ETFs or
funds)''

Such as ``green shops'' there are green investing platforms, green ETFs,
etc. All of these are essentially forms of branding designed to make it
easier for investors to find an investing product they trust.

There are many `green investment platforms' who to trust?

\paragraph{Assets: Real Estate}\label{assets-real-estate}

According to (Debnath et al., 2022) 39\% of global CO\textsubscript{2}
emissions comes from the building sector. Construction is large emitter
because of the use of concrete; super tall buildings are very
CO\textsubscript{2} intensive (Zhao \& Qin, 2015). Building emissions
can be reduced by using sustainable design and materials, \emph{digital
twins} of architecture enable pre-visualization of different designs
(Panaro, Parlow \& Amman, 2024) as well modeling the usage of the
building, for example the interior shop floors in commercial real-estate
(Jia, Wang \& Zhang, 2023). In housing development, there's evidence of
`green' buildings achieving a `higher financial return than conventional
buildings, both in terms of rent and sale price' (Oyedokun, 2017).

Investing into real-estate is increasingly available on co-investing
platforms allowing retail investors access into this asset class with a
relatively low starting price. Thus investing in sustainable
architecture can be an attractive proposal both from an environmental as
from a financial standpoint, also providing a passive income stream in
the form of rent.

Retail investors can lend small amounts of money (also known as
MicroLending) on peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms such as Twino.
These loans and pooled and the risk is borne in aggregate as a form of
risk-management.

\paragraph{Assets: Crypto}\label{assets-crypto}

There's a large trend of fusion of decentralized finance (DeFi) and
traditional finance (TradFi), with the largest established investors,
such as BlackRock, launching tokenized funds (Sandor, 2024; Matos, 2024;
Securitize, 2024).

Crypto investing removes most entry barriers while having high risk.
Cryptocurrencies are the most popular financial action among young
people (ADD CITATION) yet in some ways crypto needs even more financial
literacy than traditional financial assets. Anon (n.d.m) estimates over
600 million cryptocurrency users worldwide.

Brazilian (N=573 ) ``Crypto investors in Brazil are generally younger,
male, and exhibit higher risk tolerance compared to non-crypto
investors.'' Colombo \& Yarovaya (2024) ``Brazil's planned adoption of
CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency).'' ``It finds that risk tolerance,
economic pessimism, and a belief in better investment acumen are
significant predictors of crypto investment.''

\textbf{Centralized Crypto Exchanges vs Self-Wallets} - Centralized
Crypto Exchanges are in essence loaning assets from the user. ``The
piece of the settlement aimed at getting important information to
customers is more understandable from a retail protection standpoint.
Customers who lend crypto assets to a company in exchange for a promised
return should get the information they need to assess the risks against
the rewards'' (Hester M. Peirce, 2022).

\textbf{Financial Engineering} - Crypto enables financial innovation and
financial engineering by anyone with some programming skills.

\textbf{Pricing Crypto}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Taiwan bans buying cryptocurrencies with credit card because the
  volatility makes it similar to gambling (David Attlee, 2022; 廣編企劃,
  2022).
\item
  However volatility is relative. Volatile national currencies lead
  people to find other assets to hold. If your national currency is
  collapsing, you might find crypto has a relative safe haven to keep
  your funds.
\item
  People like Turkey losing 75\% of the value of their assets when
  currency collapses, why people buy crypto.
\item
  Bitcoin is by far the most popular crypocurrency with it's high price
  volatility creating opportunities for high gains and high losses.
  While bitcoin has been called a ``digital gold'' for store of value,
  its volatility characteristics are very different from gold, as seen
  on this chart.
\end{itemize}

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-54-output-1.pdf}}

The volatility of the markets has notably shifted crypto research
towards pricing theories.

DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) can be use in a similar way
to Hedge funds, a DAO can have a shared multi-sign wallet than is
invested together.

A lot of financial tooling and more than trad-fi has been replicated in
crypto.

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) which have an investable
treasury may be compare to Hedge Funds as a collective form of
investing. Because of the on-chain nature where transactions are visible
to anyone, they may be seen as more transparent. Typically DAOs have a
voting system to make decision while Hedge Funds may be more centrally
controlled. Also, the legislation affecting each would be different as
hedge funds are an older and more established financial tool whereas
DAOs still fall in somewhat of a gray area.

A data oracle is the concept of a source of real-world data which can be

information which could serve as an oracle for carbon labeling,
packaging, transportation, consumption, and waste.

``We believe that markets for ecosystem assets need to scale urgently,
starting with carbon markets. The challenge is to make these instruments
as recognizable as tradable assets, as measurable as financial
securities, and as investable as other asset classes. Capital must flow
into the environment at scale to deliver climate action.'' ``Efficient
financial markets allocate and manage risk based on effective price
mechanisms, and this relies on access to credible information.'' BeZero

``Everyone in the market is struggling to effectively price and manage
risk.. the Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM); a rapidly recovering market,
forecasted to grow by as much as 100x, but constrained by a nascent
market structure.'' ``The BCR is a carbon-only expected return model. It
utilises a risk-based approach and seeks to give everyone a common
language of risk. One that is translatable to that used by the \$200
trillion of assets in global financial markets.'' BeZero (2022a)

\paragraph{Divesting}\label{divesting}

Divesting is the inverse of investing. Divesting may have a meaningful
impact on companies if large numbers of retail investors collaborate on
`banning' the company to send a message to the board. Small individual
divestment has no impact on the governance decisions.

In institutional finance, the Norwegian \$1.3T USD sovereign wealth fund
(the world's largest) started a divestment trend in 2016 by divesting
first from coal following by divesting from oil, gas and coal extracting
companies (Ben Martin, 2017; Holger, 2019). Their plan to reach net zero
CO2e nonetheless only targets 2050. Furthermore, who would be the
counterpart for such large transactions. The fund also announced
divesting from Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, however has yet to
sell any shares citing lack of buyers on the Moscow stock market.

University of California also followed suit with divestment of its
\$126B USD portfolio from oil and gas.

While divesting makes news headlines, even divestment by large
institutional investors, such as the Norwegian National Pension Fund
(GPFG), has a negligible effect on the heavy polluters' business; by the
same logic, it can be deducted, the financial effect of retail investors
divesting, is meaningless. If retail investors act in aggregate, the
reputational effect needs further research. \emph{``To halt climate
change, some investors have decided to divest from fossil fuel
companies. Reviewing the literature suggests that divestment from fossil
fuel has limited financial consequences; it slightly increases divested
firms' risk and their cost of capital, while reducing divested firms'
market value,''} is the pessimistic conclusion by(Plantinga \&
Scholtens, 2024)

\subsection{Econometrics: Decoupling Economic Growth from Environmental
Degradation}\label{econometrics-decoupling-economic-growth-from-environmental-degradation}

\paragraph{How to Measure the Economy}\label{how-to-measure-the-economy}

\emph{Econometrics} is the science of measuring the economy.

\begin{quote}
The creator of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) metric in 1934 Simon
Kuznets said: ``The welfare of a nation can scarcely be inferred from a
measurement of national income as defined by GDP\ldots Goals for `more'
growth should specify of what and for what'' (United States. Bureau of
Foreign and Domestic Commerce, Seventy-Third Congress \& Kuznets, Simon,
1934).
\end{quote}

GDP was the culmination of previous work by many authors, beginning with
William Petty in the 17th century (Rockoff, 2020). This long journey
underlines how a metric about a complex system such as the economy is
continuous work in progress. There has been ongoing work to create
improved metrics such as the the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),
Human Development Index (HDI), Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), Green
GDP, Inclusive Wealth Index, and others (Bleys \& Whitby, 2015; Kovacic
\& Giampietro, 2015; Anielski, 2001).

Measuring wellbeing in addition to GDP and the metric should including
resiliency dashboards, to to visualize metrics beyond GDP and they are
an integral part of country reports (GreensEFA, 2023). Similarly, the
doughnut (donut) economics (more below) model calls for a
\emph{``dashboard of indicators''} (TED, 2018).

\paragraph{Evolution of Economics: New
Metrics}\label{evolution-of-economics-new-metrics}

The first two decades of the 21st century have seen increasing economic
thinking, looking to challenge, improve and upgrade capitalism to match
our current environmental, social, and technological situation, often
called \emph{New Economics.} Some of these include behavioral economics,
sustainable capitalism, regenerative capitalism, doughnut economics,
ecological economics, blue economy, degrowth, attention economy, gift
economy, intent economy, among others. There's no lack of published
books on changing capitalism, which goes to show there's readership for
these ideas. Build a new economic theory is out of scope for my thesis
design, however I'll focus on the parts of economic theory I believe are
relevant for \emph{interaction design}-ing for sustainability.

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-56-output-1.pdf}}

There are those looking for \emph{new metrics}. One of the first
innovators, already in 1972, was Buthan, with the \emph{Gross National
Happiness Index (GNH)}, which in turn inspired the UN, decades later, in
2012, to create the International Wellbeing and Happiness Conference and
the International Happiness Day(Ribeiro \& Lemos Marinho, 2017; Kamei et
al., 2021). The World Bank talks about the comprehensive GDD+ metrics in
its Changing the Wealth of Nations report (World Bank, 2021).

The Wellbeing Economy Alliance (WEAll) countries (New Zealand, Iceland,
Finland, Scotland, Wales) as well as the EU and Canada, started the
coalition in 2018 looking to involve more broad-based metrics in
developing their societies(Ellsmoor, 2019; David Suzuki Foundation,
2021; CEPR, 2022; Scottish Government, 2022; Wellbeing Economy Alliance,
2022).

Giacalone, Mattera \& Nissi (2022) looks at wellbeing of Italian
communities and proposes a new composite index.

There's work ongoing on macroeconomic modeling, aiming to create a
\emph{digital twin} of the economy. Some of the most complex computer
models of the economy include the Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal
Model (GIMF) (Laxton et al., 2010) and DSGE (Dynamic stochastic general
equilibrium).

\paragraph{Pricing Externalities}\label{pricing-externalities}

In the simplest sense, prices do not capture all costs. ``Consumption,
production, and investment decisions of individuals, households, and
firms often affect people not directly involved in the transactions''
(Helbling, 2012). Externalities as an economic concept was implied by
Alfred Marshall, one of the founders of neoclassical economics, in his
1890 treatise ``Principles of Economics,'' and further developed by
Arthur Cecil Pigou in his 1920 book ``The Economics of Welfare''
(Marshall, 1997; Pigou, 2002). As of 2023, the value of unpriced
externalities which are not included in the GDP is 7.3 trillion USD per
year (Trucost \& TEEB for Business Coalition, 2023). The award-winning
economist Mariana Mazzucato argues in (Gupta, 2020) we should include
more into how we value unpaid labor, relating to the social (S in ESG)
(Mazzucato, 2018) as part of our metrics.

\paragraph{Classical Economics vs Ecological
Economics}\label{classical-economics-vs-ecological-economics}

While Adam Smith is most famous for his concept of the \emph{invisible
hand} first appearing in \emph{The Theory of Moral Sentiments} (1759)
and further developed in his seminal work \emph{The Wealth of Nations},
published in 1776, his writings also highlight the interdependence of
economic actors, who through specialization increase productivity, but
also increasingly dependent on each another as well as the role of
empathy in individual actions (Atal et al., 2024).

Ecological economics doesn't necessarily argue with the foundation of
classical economics, rather ecological economics finds the classical
economics model and by extension neoclassical economics are
\emph{incomplete,} ignoring the physical limits of natural resources.
Ecological economics draws attention to the interdependence of economy
and the ecosystem; there are physical limits to economic growth on a
planet with finite resources.

The biggest point of contention is the necessity of \emph{economic
growth}. The founder of ecological economics Herman Daly was talking
about \emph{prosperity without growth} more than two decades ago,
focusing on the diminishing natural resources (Daly, 1997). Daly was
teaching economics to undergraduates at Louisina State University when
he grew dissatisfied with the standard model of the market, which didn't
include any inputs (resources) or outputs (pollution), and later modeled
his work by placing the economy \emph{within} the larger system of the
ecosphere (Ketcham, 2023). More recently.(Jackson, 2009, 2017) have
expanded on these ideas with recipes for a \emph{post-growth} world,
making the ideas seem more tangible and precise, yet mostly untested in
the real world.

Writing in 1973, E. F. Schumacher argued economics overlooks both
natural resource depletion and environmental degradation and draws on
religion (particularly Buddhism) to suggest a simpler way of life:

\begin{quote}
\emph{``Simplicity and non-violence are obviously closely related. The
optimal pattern of consumption, producing a high degree of human
satisfaction by means of a relatively low rate of consumption, allows
people to live without great pressure and strain and to fulfil the
primary injunction of Buddhist teaching: `Cease to do evil; try to do
good.'\,''} (Schumacher, 1985)
\end{quote}

New economic thinkers are asking how can economic growth and
sustainability be compatible. Some even ask if \emph{economic growth}
itself is the wrong goal? (Diduch, 2020). Degrowth is the most famous
contender in that branch of economics. Is Decoupling Economic Growth and
CO2e Emissions Possible? Is Green Growth an oxymoron? No-one knows as it
hasn't been done before. Degrowth proponents are pessimistic it's
possible to decouple greenhouse gas emissions from economic growth;
historical data shows does not show any decoupling. Some data from China
shows decoupling?

\paragraph{Doughnut Economics and Regenerative
Capitalism}\label{doughnut-economics-and-regenerative-capitalism}

\emph{Doughnut Economics}, introduced in the eponymous book uses a
simple visualization of a doughnut (donut) to help us grasp the big
picture of the economy \emph{embedded} inside the physical and social
worlds (Raworth, 2017). It allows one to see the social shortfall and
ecological overshoot of nations at the same time (Fanning et al., 2021).
The doughnut concept is simple and deep at the same time, a useful as
social object to enable starting conversations with people from all
walks of life, independent of their politics leanings. As Raworth calls
it, it's a \emph{``self-portrait of humanity in the beginning of the
21st century''\textbf{.}} Combining the \emph{SDGs (Sustainable
Development Goals)} inside the doughnut and the \emph{Planetary
Boundaries} (Earth's ecological ceiling) outside the doughnut, leaves a
space inside the donut represents a state of equilibrium and balance on
spaceship Earth.

In some ways this Doughnut Economics can be described as a movement.
Doughnut Action Labs enable local communities to build local donuts
customized to local problems. While the ideas have not yet been
implemented on a country-level, smaller scale doughnut economics'
success stories have inspired cities to take a comprehensive view of the
doughnut of their own city with several EU cities adopting the vision
(Jordan G. Teicher, 2021). While critics say doughnut economics would
expand the role of the government (Horwitz, 2017), doughnut
practitioners in Brussels believe everything can be adapted to the place
and context (Oikos Denktank, 2021; BrusselsDonut, 2022).

The city of Amsterdam is developing shorter food chains (which save
CO\textsubscript{2e}) and linking residents with food production and
reconnecting people to the food which foster collaboration in the
community (Circle Economy, 2021). Amsterdam has also built comprehensive
dashboards called the Circular Economy Monitor which makes it easy for
anyone to see the progress being made towards the Dutch goal to be a
circular economy by 2050 (Waterstaat, 2019; Gemeente Amsterdam, 2022).

\emph{In his 2015 paper Regenerative Capitalism}, John Fullerton, an
investor and a capital markets and derivatives expert, builds his
economic theory on the ideas of Club of Rome and the Limits to Growth
(Anon, 1972) as well as taking inspiration from R. Buckminster Fuller.

\begin{quote}
\emph{``Nature is a totally efficient, self-regenerating system. If we
discover the laws that govern this system and live synergistically
within them, sustainability will follow and humankind will be a
success.''} (Fuller, 1983)
\end{quote}

``{[}H{]}uman civilization is embedded in the biosphere,'' Fullerton's
ideas aim to balance efficiency with resiliency so the whole system
doesn't become brittle and break (John Fullerton, 2011, 2022; Confino,
2015). While regenerative capitalism recognizes the need for economic
growth it also deems ``{[}t{]}he quality of growth matters'' (Anon,
2023w). For example, he cites the example of Triodos Bank which already
in the 1980s focused on sustainable banking championing responsibility,
transparency, and business ethics. A member of the Global Alliance for
Banking on Values, Triodos finances projects in nature preservation and
restoration (GABV, 2023).

\subsubsection{Decarbonization
Scenarios}\label{decarbonization-scenarios}

The possibility of decoupling economic growth from CO\textsubscript{2e}
emissions (also known as decarbonizing the economy or eco-economic
decoupling) or is hotly debated (pun intended) among scientists. (Keyßer
\& Lenzen, 2021) provides several scenarios for low, medium, and high
levels of decoupling titled Degrowth, IPCC, and Dec-Extreme.

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-57-output-1.pdf}}

Looking a the United Kingdom, (harrisson, 2019) concludes UK's
CO\textsubscript{2e} emissions have fallen 43\% from 1990 to 2017
through the use of less carbon-intensive energy sources and argues for
moderate policies in (Hausfather \& Peters, 2020).

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-58-output-1.pdf}}

Meanwhile the cumulative CO\textsubscript{2e} emissions trend in the UK
in the same timeframe show the historic responsibility of UK (Global
Carbon Budget, 2023).

CO2e emissions and GDP growth per capita follow a similar path in the
BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) as well as
in Vietnam and Somalia (Viana Espinosa De Oliveira \& Moutinho, 2022;
Warsame, Mohamed \& Sarkodie, 2024; Raihan et al., 2024).

William Northaus won a Novel Prize in 2018 for attempting to combine
climate change and economics in a single, integrated assessment model,
named \emph{Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy (DICE)}, however his
predictions are considered inaccurate by climate scientists,
underestimating the risk of catastrophic warming, tipping point and the
probability of higher temperatures leading to mass death
(\textbf{etchamWhenIdiotSavants2023?}; Stern, Stiglitz \& Taylor, 2022;

\subsection{Greenwashing: Data-Driven
Benchmarks}\label{greenwashing-data-driven-benchmarks}

\subsubsection{The Problem of
Greenwashing}\label{the-problem-of-greenwashing}

Greenwashing is one of the largest blockers of sustainability. Both the
European Commission and the Chair of U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) Gary Gensler have called for more legislation to curb
business greenwashing practices. \emph{``If it's easy to tell if milk is
fat-free by just looking at the nutrition label, it might be time to
make it easier to tell if''green'' or ``sustainable'' funds are really
what they say they are''} says Gensler (US Securities and Exchange
Commission, 2022). EU regulation for standardizing sustainability
reporting is called the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive
(CSRD) entered into force in 2023 as is being gradually ramped up until
2027.

Green investing only makes sense if it's possible to distinguish
sustainable investments from not sustainable ones. Humans feel as if
choosing green is useless and give up. Sustainabile investing is firstly
about changes in legislation which set stricter sustainability standards
on companies (as discussed above). Secondly, increased transparency, new
metrics, and new tools make it feasible to differentiate more
sustainable companies from less sustainable ones.

Wikirate currently lists 4282 metrics https://wikirate.org/Metric

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-60-output-1.pdf}}

Upcoming EU greenwashing legislation hopes to curb misleading
communications by companies. \emph{``Make benchmark methodologies more
transparent when it comes to ESG \& put forward standards for the
methodology of low-carbon and ESG benchmarks in EU''} (European
Commission, 2019b). Until new legislation is ramped up (2030 in the EU),
building consumer awareness is crucial as currently most
emission-reduction programs are voluntary and thus affected only by
consumer demand (André \& Valenciano-Salazar, 2022). Greenwashing is
widespread in company social media communications (Geoffrey Supran,
2022). A number of new AI-based tools aim to find instances of
greenwashing. ClimateBert AI finds rampant greenwashing (Bingler, Kraus
\& Leippold, 2021; Sahota, 2021).

While the EU has proposed legislation to curb greenwashing, EU climate
policy itself has been criticized for greenwashing. Sometimes
greenwashing comes under legislative protection Kira Taylor (2021).
(Booth, 2022) describes how ``A recent investigation shows illegal
logging of protected areas in eastern European countries that supplies
residential wood pellets in Italy. Belgium, Denmark, and the Netherlands
are importing pellets from Estonia, where protected areas are logged for
pellets and the country has lost its forest carbon sink, despite
large-scale wood pellet plants being certified `sustainable' by the
Sustainable Biomass Program''.

In recycling systems,(Purkiss et al., 2022) highlights the confusion
between compostable and biodegradable plastics and public
misunderstanding what happens to these plastics when they reach the
landfill: ``{[}m{]}ost plastics marketed as''home compostable'' don't
actually work, with as much as 60\% failing to disintegrate after six
months''. Shopping bags marketed as \emph{biodegradable} don't show
deterioration after 3 years in salt-water sea environment (Napper \&
Thompson, 2019).

\subsubsection{Sustainability Standards}\label{sustainability-standards}

(International Trade Centre, 2022) currently lists 334 different
sustainability standards: ``Towards a meaningful economy'' ``The world's
largest database for sustainability standards'', ``We provide free,
accessible, comprehensive, verified and transparent information on over
300 standards for environmental protection, worker and labor rights,
economic development, quality and food safety, as well as business
ethics.''

Put very simply (knowingly oversimplifying), in traditional finance
legislation is an enabler of corruption as in the case of Swiss privacy
laws, where illegal funds can be hidden, while in cryptocurrencies, the
lack of clear and comprehensive regulation is an enabler of corruption.

\subsubsection{Product Databases}\label{product-databases}

In order to consider the sustainability on a product level, there should
be a directory of all the world's products.

All of the world's products are subject to one or another standard and
although they are not uniform, there's some documentation existing about
every product. GS1 is the organization providing EAN/UPC barcodes on
most consumer products (GS1, n.d.).

financialization for the 2008 economic crisis where the real economy and
financial markets disconnected, proposing a new index for
\emph{participation finance} aiming to ground the financial economy in
the real economy; rooted in Islamic banking, participation finance
avoids highly speculative activities, which are seen as exploitative,
looking to promote stability, transparency, and fairness.

\subsubsection{Credit-Scoring}\label{credit-scoring}

Companies assess customer's credit score to decide credit-worthiness,
however inversely, how can customers rate companies? Indexes make
comparing companies possible. There are many-many indexes, scoring
systems, ratings, certifications, etc.

willing to pay more for environmentally friendly products. The study
identifies a''green premium'' and a ``certified green premium,''
indicating increased WTP for bio-based and certified bio-based
products''} (Morone et al., 2021). Particulary in Italy, a study of
consumer awareness of sustainable supply chains shows Italian consumers
have a strong preference for antibiotic-free meat (Mazzocchi et al.,
2022).

\subsubsection{ESG (Promise): Countering Misinformation with
Transparency}\label{esg-promise-countering-misinformation-with-transparency}

Since the 1970s, international bodies, governments, and private
corporations have developed sustainability measurement metrics, the
prominent one being ESG (Environmental, Social, and Corporate
Governance) developed by the UN in 2005. This rating system has already
been implemented or is in the process of being adopted on stock markets
all over the world and has implications beyond the stock markets,
allowing analysts to measure companies' performance on the triple bottom
line: the financial, social, and environmental metrics.

ESG gives banks a new tool to market and sell environmentally conscious
opportunities to institutional investors, for example, universities - a
case in point being the recent partnership between HSBC and the
University of Edinburgh (Reid, 2020). Another recent example is one of
the largest private banks in Switzerland, Lombard Odier \& Co, when they
launched a thematic bio-economy fund inspired by the words of The Prince
of Wales, `Building a sustainable future is, in fact, the growth story
of our time' (Jersey Evening Post, 2020).

In Taiwan, the Taipei stock market has listed ESG stocks since 2017 and
was hailed by Bloomberg as a regional leader in ESG reporting (Grauer,
2017). In December 2017, the \emph{FTSE4Good TIP Taiwan ESG Index} was
launched, which tracks ESG-rated companies on the Taipei stock market
(Taiwan Index, 2024). Nasdaq Nordic introduced an ESG index in 2018, and
Euronext, the largest stock market in Europe, introduced an ESG index
and a series of derivative instruments in the summer of 2020 (Euronext,
2020).

(Anon, 2022o) suggests ACWI ESG leaders outperform the non-ESG screened
ACWI based on comparing MSCI indexes. It's notable that ACWI ESG starts
to outperform the traditional ACWI only in the past few years.

  2019 became a part of its ESG product offering (Toffel \& Sice, 2011;
  Mike Hower, Dec 9, 2015 7am EST; Indices, Oct 03, 2016, 08:30 ET;
  Anon, 2019b). It's parent company S\&P Global also acquired
  RobecoSAM's ESG rating business, consolidating S\&P's control of ESG
  ratings (George Geddes, 2019).
\end{itemize}

Sustainable Investing is Based on Data. Greenwashing is a large
detractor from environmental action as it's difficult to know what is
sustainable and what is not. Greenwashing Disturbs Sustainable Capital
Allocation. Greenwashing erodes trust. Greenwashing has a negative
Impact on Credibility.

\subsubsection{ESG (Tools)}\label{esg-tools}

``{[}T{]}hanks to other emerging technology like IoT sensors (to collect
ESG data) and blockchain (to track transactions), we have the
infrastructure to collect more data, particularly for machine
consumption. By measuring real-time energy usage, transportation routes,
manufacturing waste, and so forth, we have more quantifiable ways to
track corporations' environmental performance without relying purely on
what they say.'' (Sahota, 2021)

Google Environmental Insights Explorer enables local governments
(cities) to measure CO2 emissions and enact environmental policies that
optimize city functions such as traffic flows (Anon, n.d.ar; Nicole
Lombardo, 2021)

\subsubsection{ESG (Fintech)}\label{esg-fintech}

In the U.S. and European banking sector (Dicuonzo, Palmaccio \& Shini,
2024) performed an analysis of 180 banks' data. Fintech Index and ESG
Scores have a positive correlation, suggesting the adoption of
technology has a statistically significant influence on better
environmental stewardship, social and governance quality. Even larger
predictors of high ESG score were than were Board Gender Diversity
(Women on Board), the Size of the Bank, and Board Independence
(governance structures with more independent directors could be more
socially and environmentally responsible). On the flip side, out of the
initial 1551 banks considered the majority did not have ESG data
available to be able to perform the comparison.

In China, (Lu \& Li, 2023) finds \emph{digitization} is the pathway to
Environmental Information Disclosure (EID) and Green Innovation.

\subsubsection{ESG (Governance)}\label{esg-governance}

Governance drives social and environmental initiatives at companies.

MSCI research finds company boards severely lacking in climate experts;
among the 164 large CO2 emitters benchmarks by the \emph{Climate Action
100+} alliance (Climate Action 100+, 2023; Sommer, Demirtaş \& Muirhead,
2024).

(Climate Action 100+, 2023) tracks large emitters around the world with
combined market cap of \$10.3 Trillion USD.

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-66-output-1.pdf}}

A systematic meta-review of 153 research papers of ESG literature around
the world reports the major determinants of high ESG performance are
board member diversity, firm size, and CEO attributes (Martiny et al.,
2024).

Shareholders can leverage their numbers and join forces in order to
affect the board members of large corporations. For example, the As Your
Sow NGO aims to champion CSR through building coalitions of shareholders
and taking legal action, including the Fossil Free Funds initiative
which researches and rates funds' exposure to fossil fuels finance and
its sister project Invest in Your Values rates retirement plans offered
by employers (mostly US technology companies) (As You Sow, 2024a, 2024b)

\subsubsection{ESG (Crisis)}\label{esg-crisis}

ESG companies don't emit less CO2 than non-ESG companies.. ESG Criticism
``25 ESG ratings from three major providers (Moody's Analytics, MSCI
Inc., and Refinitiv)'' - \emph{``well-rated companies do not emit
significantly less carbon than those with lower scores.''} (Amenc, Goltz
\& Naly, 2023).

The lack of rigor is creating a backlash against ESG reporting.(Yu,
2021) reports ESG is filled with greenwashing. Anon (2023b) several US
states are introducing regulation for ESGs to curb greenwashing. Frances
Schwartzkopff (2022a) suggests the ESMA and EU has strengthened
legislation to counter ESG greenwashing. Shashwat Mohanty (2022):
``sustainable funds don't buy Zomato's ESG narrative''. Bindman,
Mendonca \& Mendonca (2024) reports large ESG funds managed by BlackRock
and Vanguard are investing into JBS, a meat-packing company which is
linked to deforestation of the Amazon rainforest through it's supply
chain.

\subsubsection{ESG (Language): Shared
Language}\label{esg-language-shared-language}

ESG Becomes a Shared Language.

The advice consultancies are providing to banks establishes a common
language and helps banks to sell strategical alignment for long-term
institutional sustainability in terms of environmental, social, and
governance performance. PWC suggests \emph{``asset managers educate
their staff and client base. `It will be critical to build stronger ESG
expertise among their employees by up-skilling existing staff on ESG
principles and strategically scout for and integrate more diverse and
ESG-trained talent'\,''} (PWC, 2020)

While ESG is riddled with problems, it has started a common language and
there are many ways how to improve it

\begin{itemize}
\item
  For AI-powered assistants to be able to provide guidance, metrics are
  needed to evaluate sustainable assets, and ESG provides the current
  state-of-the-art for this. The largest obstacle to eco-friendly
  investing is greenwashing where companies and governments try to
  portray an asset as green when in reality it's not. A personal
  investing assistant can provide an interface to focus on transparency,
  highlighting data sources and limitations, to help users feel in
  control of their investment decisions, and potentially even provide
  large-scale consumer feedback on negative practices back to the
  business through infringement discovery.

How are large corporations responding to the climate crisis?

Lack of leadership. (Capgemini, 2022): ``Many business leaders see
sustainability as costly obligation rather than investment in the
future''.

The CEO of the Swedish clothing producer H\&M - one of the largest
fast-fashion in the world -, recognizes the potential impact of
\emph{conscious consumers} as a threat (Hoikkala, 2019).

Many large businesses have tried to find solutions by launching
climate-focused funding. (Korosec, 2021) reports that Amazon's 2B USD to
a Climate Pledge Fund earmarked to fix climate problems is invested in
energy, logistics, and packaging startups, which will reduce material
waste. ``Good intentions don't work, mechanisms do,'' Amazon's founder
Bezos is quoted as saying in (Clifford, 2022). Walmart is taking a
similar approach, having launched a project in 2017 to set
CO\textsubscript{2} reduction targets in collaboration with its
suppliers (Walmart, 2023). These examples underline how money marketed
as climate funding by retail conglomerates means focus on reducing
operational cost of running their business through automation and
material savings.

Large corporations such as Nestle and Coca Cola support the biodiversity
law to have a level playing field for business (Greens EFA, 2023).

\subsubsection{ESG (Social): Slavery Still
Exists}\label{esg-social-slavery-still-exists}

In 2023, an estimated 50 million people were in slavery around the
world; lack of supply chain visibility hides forced labor and
exploitation of undocumented migrants in agricultural work; 71\% of
enslaved people are estimated to be women. (Kunz et al., 2023; Borrelli
et al., 2023). (Christ \& V Helliar, 2021) estimates 20 million people
are \emph{`stuck inside corporate blockchains'}. The Global Slavery
Index measures the considerable \emph{`import risk'} of having slavery
inside its imports (Walk Free, 2023). (Hans van Leeuwen, 2023) slavery
affects industries from fashion to technology, including sustainability
enablers such as solar panels. ILO estimates 236 billion USD are
generated in illegal profits from forced labor (International Labour
Organization, 2024).

cocoa, according to government estimates''(Anand Chandrasekhar \&
Andreas Gefe, 2021) begging the question can Swiss traders have more
scrutiny over what they trade?

Slavery is connected to environmental degradation, and climate change
(Decker Sparks et al., 2021). Enslaved people are used in environmental
crimes such as 40\% of deforestation globally. Cobalt used in
technological products is in risk of being produced under forced labor
in the D.R. Congo (Sovacool, 2021). In India and Pakistan, forced labor
in brick kiln farms is possible to capture remotely from satellite
images (Boyd et al., 2018). In effect, the need for cheap labor turns
slavery into a \emph{subsidy} keeping environmental degradation
happening.

\subsubsection{ESG (Social): How to Trace Worker's
Rights}\label{esg-social-how-to-trace-workers-rights}

While reducing slavery in the supply chain sets very low bar for ESG,
another aspect of supply tracing is the treatment of workers and working
conditions.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  ``commodification of human beings''
\item
  Companies that intend to to give supply chain a voice'' by connecting
  workers directly to the consumer (even in anonymously, to protect the
  workers from retribution), include \emph{CTMFile} and
  \emph{Alexandria}.

I adopted a face-to-face method to increase response rates distributing

verbal permission from educators in their ´ classrooms to distribute the
survey flyer. The flyer included a colorful AI-generated visual with a
futuristic game-link female figure, the title ``climate anxiety
survey'', a website link (ziran.tw) and scannable QR-code.

Similarly to (Liu et al., 2023a) I distributed the survey in schools in
the Northern, Soutern, Central, and East regions of Taiwan.

The survey only included questions and descriptions in Chinese. I have
used the Claude 3 Opus model to translate them to english for this

\subsection{Research Design}\label{research-design}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Christian Rohrer (2022): Research methods
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The research design of this study consists of 3 steps.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Qualitative research targeted at financial and interaction design
  experts, leading to a \emph{wish list} of features.
\item
  Survey potential users' preferences, including a choice experiment of
  the proposed features.
\item
  Design a prototype of the personal sustainable finance AI assistant,
  tested using qualitative methods in a focus group.
\item
  This mixed-method research design is divided into three stages
  (fig.~11).
\item
  My purpose for the first qualitative stage is to explore the general
  themes arising from the literature review related to the design of AI
  advisors for investing. I will identify specific user experience
  factors, through interviewing experts in financial technology and user
  experience design and reviewing existing applications on the
  marketplace. At this stage in the research, the central concept being
  studied is defined generally as expectations towards a sustainable
  investment AI advisor.
\item
  I will then proceed to the second, quantitative stage, informed by the
  previously identified factors, and prepare a survey, including a
  Likert scale, and a choice experiment, focusing on the preferences of
  the potential users aged 18-35, living in Sweden and Taiwan (see
  fig.~12 on next page), exploring the relationship between independent
  variables: - ``Interest in Sustainability'' - ``Interest in
  Investing'' - ``Preferred Features'' - and the dependent variable
  ``User Sign-ups''.
\item
  In the third stage, I will return to the qualitative methods, by
  building a prototype of the sustainable investing AI companion, taking
  into account insights gathered in the previous stage. I will use a
  focus group to discuss the prototype, and conduct a thematic analysis
  of the discussions' recordings, leading to further validation of
  previously gathered data and possible changes in the prototype. The
  gained insights, accompanied by the app prototype, which embodies my
  findings, will be the final outcome of my research.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conceptual Framework}\label{conceptual-framework}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The conceptual framework map (fig.~13) presents the key concepts
  arising from the literature review thus far in the research process.
  I'm using these concepts when developing interview strategies for
  phase one of the research, developing the survey questionnaire for
  phase two, as well as for building the Personal Sustainable AI
  Financial Advisor (PSAA) for young adults at the final stage of the
  process. However, I expect the conceptual framework to further evolve
  with additional findings while conducting my research.

Conceptual Model

\subsection{Research Methods}\label{research-methods}

\subsubsection{Phase One - Qualitative
Research}\label{phase-one---qualitative-research}

The qualitative research methods employed in the first stage of the
research design enables me to explore concepts arising for literature
review further, using a more open approach, without limiting the
conversation only to pre-ascribed notions. The strength of the
qualitative approach in the first stage is to encourage the discovery of
new ideas, not yet common in literature and potential user experience
factors related to sustainable investing and user experience.

\paragraph{Sampling}\label{sampling}

My qualitative sampling structure uses non-probability snowball
sampling, with the following criteria: financial industry, fintech, and
design experts everywhere, including in Taiwan and Sweden, but also
Estonia, Portugal, and elsewhere.

\textbf{Method:} Semi-Structured Interviews

I will conduct exploratory research in English using semi-structured
interviews recorded online and offline.

\subsubsection{Phase Two - Quantitative
Research}\label{phase-two---quantitative-research}

The strength of quantitative research is to enable me to access a larger
sample of potential users in two countries, using online survey methods,
and to validate some of the qualitative findings from stage one.

\textbf{Sampling} My quantitative sampling structure uses a judgmental
criterion: age 18-35, located in Sweden or Taiwan, surveyed using an
English-language online survey.

\textbf{Method:} Likert The survey includes a Likert scale between 1 to
7 to validate key findings from the first stage of the research by
assessing responses to statements regarding the app's design, features,
and other criteria that may still emerge.

\textbf{Method:} Choice Experiment The survey includes a choice
experiment between different sets of potential features available when
communicating with the sustainable finance AI companion.

\subsubsection{Phase Three - Qualitative
Research}\label{phase-three---qualitative-research}

In the last phase, I will return to the qualitative methods to further
validate the quantitative findings from stage two. Here my focus will be
on operationalizing the gathered insights into a prototype that users
can experiment with and discuss with their peers in a focus group
setting. Sampling

The phase three sampling structure uses a judgmental criterion: - age
18-35 - located in Taiwan - Using the English language for discussion

A focus group of 6 to 10 people will be gathered in Tainan. Because
in-person presence is required in this stage, the prototype will only be
tested by potential users physically present in Taiwan. To avoid
convenience sampling, I will post online ads in English to invite people
who I don't know personally, to participate in a ``financial AI
application testing group'' (wording may change).

\textbf{Method:} Focus Group The strength of a focus group is the
ability to observe potential users in a social setting, where knowledge
can be exchanged between the participants. The whole experience,
including emerging conversations, will be recorded and transcribed.

\textbf{Method:} Thematic Analysis Finally, I will perform a thematic
analysis of the focus group transcriptions in order to validate previous
findings, and open avenues for future research.

\section{Results}\label{results}

Expected Findings

During the preparation of this research proposal I conducted a
preliminary round of facetoface interviews using 21 openended probing
questions using a convenience sampling of NCKU students on campus
between ages 19 and 29 a total of 12 respondents The interviews lasted
between 9 and 21 minutes and were conducted to get some initial feedback
on my research idea the respondents daily routines app usage feelings
towards financial questions including investing relationship with nature
and environmental sustainability These preliminary conversations led me
to emphasize more on the financial journey ie to consider the importance
of the shopping savings and payments apps students already use daily
which could serve as an entry point to becoming an investor I expect my
future research findings to confirm this initial idea and offer diverse
ways and examples of what that path could look like in practice

Survey Overview

sustainability filter for excising investing platforms Literature
College students can support extended producer responsibility

How might AI assistants empower regenerative shopping saving and
investing

Display the ESG EPR BCorp etc etc credentials for each product and
investment EPR and BCorp are success stories which should be highlighted
while ESG is largely discredited There are many existing and ongoing
approaches to sustainability The best approach might be to plug into
excising system and communities and legislation to support and empower
them

How might one design an intuitive sustainable shopping saving investing
app

Apple Watch app

What app features might college students rate as the highest priority

Personas}\label{clustering-students-to-build-3-personas}

Personas are created using K-means clustering, an unsupervised machine
learning algorithm, which clusters college students based on their
responses across 36 Likert-scale fields in the online survey. Clusters
are visualized using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), where the
principal component loadings on the X and Y axes represent the weights
of the original Likert-scale fields, transformed into the principal
components that capture the most variance.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  There is some similarity between clusters. All 3 personas report a
  high level of financial anxiety and below-average satisfaction with
  their financial literacy.
\item
  Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to convert data to lower
  dimension space. This is a predecessor of embeddings.

I propose \emph{interfaces} and \emph{workflows} to see financial
interactions through the filter of sustainability.

What kind of sustainability info do college students care about? How
would college students prefer to interact with the AI? What role would
college students prefer the AI to take? How can college students trust
AI? What can college students do to aid sustainability efforts? How
might AI assistants help college students find shopping, saving, and
investing opportunities?

``Systemic change through financial actions driving policy and market
changes encourage broader industry shifts towards greener practices''.

Overconsumption-driven extractive business practices contribute to the
degradation of Earth's natural ecosystems, pollution of water, air, and
soil, deforestation, diminishing biodiversity, climate instability,
extreme weather, modern slavery, worsening human health, and other
environmental and social challenges (ADD CITATION). Companies are
attuned to consumer demand however widespread greenwashing makes it
tiring to find sustainability-focused companies and requires extensive
time for research. Even for highly motivated people, it's difficult to
know what's sustainable.

My interest lies in understanding how AI assistants can help conscious
consumers become sustainable investors. The purpose of this study is to
explore how to provide the best user experience to potential sustainable
financial AI companion users. In their sustainability report every
company looks perfect. How can people shop, save and invest sustainably?
Where does our money go and what are some greener alternatives? The
companion enables people to be more transparent and responsible in their
consumption behavior.

This research takes place at the intersection of Taiwanese college
students, sustainability, finance, AI, and design.

For the average person like myself, my experience with money is mostly
limited to buying things at the supermarket. Food, clothes, furniture,
soap, mobile phone. This leaves very few options on how to start with
something new like saving and investing.

Could the Green Supermarket become the entry point to Green Savings and
Green Investing?

Oboarding more people for sustainable practices is a complex interaction
design issue hindered by ambiguous data (what is sustainable?) and messy
human motivations (we love buying things).

What can people who want to preserve Earth's environment, exactly do?
How can networks of people come together?

--- LLMs enable data journalists to create stories: Big Local News

Health tracking apps paired with connected devices such as Apple Watch
filled with sensors provide one model for simple interactions to
dynamically track digital health data - also known as a quantified self.
This data allows apps to provide tips how to improve health outcomes
through small daily actions such as climbing more stairs. Small
interactions allow users to align their goals with their actions.

What would be a good interface to track sustainability? What is the user
interface at scale, useful for billions of people?

One way to influence societal outcomes is to decide where to put our
money. While our financial decisions are a vote towards the type of
businesses we want to support, is it enough?

While some people are demanding sustainability, and some governments and
companies are announcing green investment opportunities, how can
consumers discover the most suitable investment options for their
situation?

How can retail investors access and differentiate between eco-friendly
sustainability-focused investable assets?

The level of knowledge of and exposure to investing varies widely
between countries and people.

Could linking green consumption patterns with sustainable investing
provide another pathway to speed up achieving climate justice as well as
personal financial goals?

In this simplified scenario, I'm in a physical offline store, doing some
shopping. When putting a bottle of Coca Cola in my basket, my AI
companion Susan will ask me a personalized question:

Does individual climate action help?

Gen-Z college students (target users) may not have the capital to make a
financial dent today however they can be early adopter and they will be
the decision-makers in a few years.

``Like climate change, the focus on individual actions as a solution is
often misplaced, though it remains a focus of media and industry. For
decades, the petrochemical industry has offloaded responsibility onto
individuals through promoting concepts such as the''carbon footprint'',
championed in a 2004 advertising campaign by British Petroleum'' Lavers,
Bond \& Rolsky (2022).

\item
  Factorial Surveys (Li et al., 2022b): ``Factorial surveys is a

  vignettes, to represent various levels of independent variables that
  are too complex or unethical to create and manipulate in real-world or
  lab situations''
\end{itemize}

and a including a choice experiment between potential feature sets in
consumption, savings, and investment.

Start with a simple but powerful question: --- Does it matter what you
buy? --- Does it matter how much you save? --- Does it matter where you
invest? Why?

\subsection{Research Limitations}\label{research-limitations}

First, finance is a highly regulated industry and the proposed user
experience designs may be limited by legal requirements. This study does
not take such limitations into account, rather focusing only on the user
experience.

This work is focused on user experience design and does attempt to make
a contribution to economics.

ESG data is expensive so couldn't be used in this research. ESG needs
data to give us an accurate understanding of the realities inside
companies and the user experience design does not address the underlying
data quality problem further than by providing a link to the data
source.

I don't have access to user financial data.

  logistics of investing so easy to use and take into account my values?
\item
  My thesis core message is : everyone should change from consumer to
  sustainability investor (define these terms in the thesis). how to do
  this? can help you become from consumer to investor i believe there's

\subsection{`Investment-as-Product'}\label{investment-as-product}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Green Filter helps you discover how to save money and the planet with
  your daily shopping. By providing an easy way for people to learn
  about and shop with sustainable companies, we imagine a world where
  people invest in their future, find great deals on responsibly-made
  products, and get useful discounts from socially responsible brands.
\item
  GreenFilter is a product that combines AI, design and marketing to
  help people manage their social impact throughout the stages of their
  lives, from young adult years to retirement. Its primary goal is to
  give people the tools they need to invest responsibly in sustainable
  companies, while also educating them on this topic. Our project offers
  a responsive website and mobile app that leverages AI and other
  advanced technologies. In addition, our prototype includes a
  reality-based virtual assistant with voice command capabilities which
  can provide customers with new insights into the world of green
  finance
\item
  GreenFilter introduces a novel, interactive point-of-sale technology
  that helps people make greener shopping decisions. The platform uses
  artificial intelligence to suggest green alternatives for products on
  your shopping list, and will also help you to find other companies
  that can make sustainable versions of the product you are buying.
\item
  As people become aware of the impact their shopping is having on the
  environment, they become interested in finding alternatives to big
  brands and large companies. GreenFilter provides designers an AI
  companion design which helps people build relationships with
  sustainability-focused companies by providing personalized
  recommendations, giving product reviews and helping them shop
  sustainably. This new tool will empower consumers to make greener
  choices throughout their lives.

\section{Early Feature Ideas}\label{early-feature-ideas}

The following early prototypes are focused on particular feature ideas
that occurred to me during the literature review process. They are naive
and meant to allow thinking in terms of \emph{what-if} a particular user
experience was possible. These prototypes were not tested with users
directly and formed a basis for directing the questions asked in a
potential user survey.

\section{Susan (Sustainability
Conversation)}\label{susan-sustainability-conversation}

\emph{What if} I could have a chat like this at the supermarket? Imagine
what questions I would ask before buying a product. AI: ``Kris, do you
still remember Coca Cola's packaging is a large contributor to ocean
plastic? You even went to a beach cleanup!'' Me: ``That's so sad but
it's tasty!'' AI. ``Remember your values. Would you like to start saving
for investing in insect farms in Indonesia instead? Predicted return 4\%
per year, according to analysts A and B.'' If I'm not so sure, I could
continue the conversation. Me: ``Tell me more'' AI: ``A recent UN study
says, the planet needs to grow 70\% more food in the next 40 years.
Experts from 8 investment companies predict growth for this category of
assets.'' Me: ``Thanks for reminding me who I am'' \ldots{} Moments
later. AI: ``This shampoo is made by Unilever, which is implicated in
deforestation in Indonesia according to reporting by World Forest Watch.
Would you consider buying another brand instead? They have a higher ESG
rating.''

Example Suggestions of the AI companion:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  ``Don't buy a car, use a car sharing service instead to save XYZ CO2.
  Service available near you: Bolt,* Uber.''
\item
  ``Use a refillable shampoo bottle to save XYZ plastic pollution''
\item
  ``Call your local politician to nudge them to improve bicycle paths
  and reduce cars in your neighborhood. Over the past 2 years, you city
  has experienced an increase of cars from 290 cars per capita to 350
  cars per capita.''*
\end{itemize}

Figure 3: Speculative scenario of an interaction between a human user
and a robo-advisor through the interface of chat messages in the context
of retail shopping for daily products.

\subsection{Sunday Market}\label{sunday-market}

\emph{What if} I could go to the Sunday market with other people who
care about sustainability? First prototype (based on literature review)
called HappyGreen's for going to the organic Sunday Market with friends.
Choose industries of focus? Fashion, Food, etc?

\subsection{True Cost}\label{true-cost}

\emph{What if} I you could see the actual cost of each product including
externalities?

feedback for companies.

\subsection{How Far?}\label{how-far}

KYC, consumers can KYC.

\subsection{CO2e Flex}\label{co2e-flex}

\emph{What if} I could show off how much CO2e I have retired?

\subsection{Sustainability Watch}\label{sustainability-watch}

\emph{What if} I could see all my sustainability data on a wearable
device in the right context?

\subsection{Narrative Layouts}\label{narrative-layouts}

\emph{What if} I spent 5 minutes every day with a guide who could help
me make more eco-friendly choices? How should the layout storyline be
structured? Well it's like Strava (that running app) for
sustainability\ldots{} or if you have heard of Welltory. I believe
sustainable choices that would improve my life.. be it what I consume,
save, invest, etc.. so I'm trying to design an app around this idea. I'm
basically building the UX of AI.. focused on sustainability. How should
the layout storyline be structured? Well it's like Strava (that running

\subsection{Shopping Divest}\label{shopping-divest}

\emph{What if} I you could build a community based on what I buy?

\subsection{Books Can Talk}\label{books-can-talk}

basic interview script - momo: what is a brand that you like'd or would
like to buy - search - please pick a product (or search again) - on
product page: what do you notice on this page? - what kind of
information is important for you on this page? - do you notice anything
else - (if the user doesn't notice the green filter, direct their
attention to it and ask: what do you think this does?) - would you click
on it - if the user says yes, continue - if thhe user says no, make note
and continue - as the extension generates a response: what do you think
about this content? - is there any information that you consider
important? - anything else you see that you think looks special - do you
see anywhere you can click? - would you click on it? - if yes, continue
- if no, make note, and continue - explain: due to the limitation of the
prototype, the test will continue on a separate page where you can ask
questions - is there anything you would like to ask the helper? - notice
if the user picks from sample questions - remind the user they can come
up with their own question - as the ai is generating content ask: do you
see any information in this content - did you know this before or is
there any info you didn't know before? make note. - front page: explain
the helper takes into account your personal info and goals. - ask: what
kind of information do you think important to share with the helper?

但丹麥談的循環永續不只是不具經濟效益的理念，循環經濟對丹麥來說不僅具有環境層面的效益，還可提升企業的競爭力，對資源生產力、就業機會、資源供應安全和自然資源的可持續利用都有極正向的回饋。
- 本次國際論壇，{我們邀請來自丹麥的設計師Ditte Lysgaard
Vind從循環經濟策略}、{Rosa N{ø}ss Bendixen從產品設計}、{Helene
Jensen從時尚產業}、更有台灣的團隊奇想創造、光寶科技、{REnato}
Lab從不同產業類別，以跨領域的思維，分享他們循環再造的創意點子! -
