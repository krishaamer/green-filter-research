\section{Abstract}\label{abstract}

Taiwanese college students are concerned with environmental issues, yet
they are hindered by the attitude-behaviour gap and lack simple tools to
affect systemic change. At the same time, strengthening environmental
policy from the European Union includes the concept of \emph{digital
product passports}, which aims to help distinguish \emph{eco-designed}
products made by \emph{circular economy} companies striving to be
zero-waste from companies that simply engage in \emph{greenwashing}.
Tracking product data from the source materials, until the consumer
purchase decision, and finally post-purchase recycling, facilitates
building \emph{transparency} into opaque global supply chains.
\emph{Data-driven interaction design}, \emph{large-language models}, and
\emph{artificial intelligence assistants} translate complex
environmental data into human-comprehensible language.

The emerging field of \emph{planetary health} recognizes profound
interconnections between our economic behaviors, ecosystem services such
as clean water, air, soil, the climate crisis, and human health. As of
2025, Earth's natural environment is being heavily degraded by the
extractive business practices of companies that make many of the
products and services we buy every day. The way we use our money to
interact with companies - through shopping as consumers and saving /
investing as investors - has an effect on the life-supporting biosphere
we rely on to keep our planet inhabitable. In essence, from an
ecological perspective, every financial action is either an investment
decision to support more environmentally-friendly companies - or to
support polluters. By democratizing financial markets, young adults can
gain greater access and influence over where their money goes, enabling
them to support sustainable and environmentally responsible companies.

My research addresses the need for tools to make sustainable financial
action more convenient, focusing in particular on college students. I
leverage \emph{design research} to find design concepts for \emph{simple
AI-based user interfaces} - also known as \emph{generative UIs -} to
help young adults participate in \emph{sustainable financial activism}.
A survey of 900 students across 20 universities in Taiwan was conducted,
enhanced by 6 expert interviews providing industry insights. The major
contribution of the study is an interactive AI-assistant prototype.

Keywords: Human-AI Interaction, Digital Sustainability, Transparency

\section{摘要}\label{ux6458ux8981}

台灣的年輕人，特別是大學生，關注環境問題，但因缺乏簡單的工具來影響系統性改變而受阻。同時，歐盟加強的環保政策引入了「數字產品護照」的概念，旨在區分由努力實現零廢棄的「循環經濟」公司製造的「生態設計」產品，與僅從事「漂綠」的公司。從原料開始追蹤產品數據，直到消費者的購買決策，最後到購後的回收，促進在不透明的全球供應鏈中建立透明度。
「數據驅動的互動設計」、「大型語言模型」和「人工智慧助理」將復雜的環境數據轉換成人類可理解的語言。

新興的「地球健康」領域認識到，我們的經濟行為、生態系統服務（如清潔的水、空氣、土壤）、氣候危機和人類健康之間存在著深刻的相互聯繫。截至2024年，由於生產我們日常購買的許多產品和服務的公司進行的開採性商業行為，地球的自然環境正被嚴重破壞。我們用金錢與公司互動的方式------作為消費者的購物和作為投資者的儲蓄/投資------對我們賴以維持地球宜居性的生命支持生物圈產生影響。從生態學角度來看，每一個財務行動不是支持更環保公司的投資決策，就是支持污染者。透過民主化金融市場，年輕人可以獲得更大的權限和影響力，控制他們的資金流向，使他們能夠支持可持續和對環境負責的公司。

我的研究針對了需要工具來使可持續的財務行動更便捷的需求，特別關注大學生。我利用設計研究來尋找簡單的基於AI的使用者介面的設計概念，也稱為生成式UI，以幫助年輕人參與可持續的財務行動主義。在台灣10所大學進行了涵蓋700名學生的調查，並透過5次專家訪談提供行業見解。研究的主要貢獻是一個互動式AI助理原型。

關鍵詞：人機互動、數字可持續性、透明度

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

How can college students find sustainable companies? Furthermore, if
given appropriate tools, could college students leverage their
purchasing power to reward sustainable companies?

Why is this important to research now? People in their twenties should
invest in their future. Millennials and younger generations like
services with a green, eco-conscious focus. Given our combined power
(I'm a Millennial) with Generation Z, we are willing to pay more for
sustainable products.

Does Individual Climate Action Matter?

My research describes the process of designing an AI companion for
college students to help with sustainable shopping, saving, and
investing.

Money spent shopping, saving, and investing in sustainable companies
serves as an incentive to adopt more sustainable practices. If used
wisely, money can reward companies for becoming more sustainable.

Encourage the least sustainable companies to improve their performance,
raising the overall baseline.

Facilitate the formation of communities centered around environmental
stewardship.

Build closer relationships with sustainability.

\subsection{Relevance}\label{relevance}

The research addresses the \textbf{\emph{``attitude-behavior gap''}}
among Taiwanese college students in taking sustainable financial action.

Convergence of the following 5 trends makes my research timely in 2024.

\subsection{Background}\label{background}

I grew up as an avid science fiction reader, which influenced my outlook
towards future possibilities. In particular, the Star Trek universe had
an imaginary portable device called a \textbf{\emph{tricorder}} (fig.~1)
enabling scientists to scan anything for insights. Be it precious
minerals inside a cave or scanning the human bodies for medical data,
its sensors would show up with some useful data. In daily life, I would
love to have such a device for consumer choices and financial decisions
- to know what to buy and which businesses to support with my money and
approval.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{./images/introduction/tricorder.jpg}

}

\caption{Captain Sulu using a Tricorder (Star Trek) - Photo copyright by
Paramount Pictures}

\end{figure}%

While a \emph{tricorder} is still science fiction, technological
advancements are getting closer and closer to producing something
similar. AIs are already integral to many parts of our lives, with
computer models producing increasingly useful outputs. The proposal for
this thesis was first written using Google's and Apple's voice
recognition software in 2020, and later switching to OpenAI's
\emph{Whisper} model, allowing me to transcribe notes with the help of
an AI assistant. As a foreigner living in Taiwan since 2019, I relied on
AI-based tools for many aspects of my life: speaking, moving, finding
food and services. When writing in Chinese, Apple's text prediction
algorithms translate pinyin to 漢字 and show the most likely character
based on my previous writing, Google's maps find efficient and
eco-friendly routes and recommend places to eat and ChatGPT provides
statistically probable advice from the sum of human knowledge. Even when
we don't realize it, AI is helping us with many mundane tasks. While it
takes incredibly complex computational algorithms to achieve all this in
the background, it's become so commonplace, we don't even think about
it. From this point of view, another AI assistant to help students with
choosing more eco-friendly businesses - to shop, save, and invest -
doesn't sound so much of a stretch.

\subsection{Motivation}\label{motivation}

Environmental degradation is increasingly affecting human lives - and
it's largely driven by manufacturing processes - of the products we
consume daily. From resource extraction in the linear economy (mining
raw materials and drilling for fossil fuels) to chemical processes
(causing contamination and pollution of the air, water, and soil) to
waste generation and greenhouse gas emissions, industries transform the
natural world into consumer products. While industry practices have
improved since the industrial revolution in the 19th century, and
continue to improve, it's possible to further improve standards of
production and raise the global baseline for sustainability, given
enough societal pressure to do so.

Nonetheless, without easily accessible and reliable data, it's difficult
to know which company is more sustainable than another. As consumers and
investors (even if only through passive ownership of savings), we don't
really know much about enterprise production practices, unless we spend
a lot of time looking at the numbers, which may be costly to access (for
example ESG reports are expensive), and mostly rely on our governments
and international bodies to keep us safe. Or just look at the brands
themselves - and pick the ones which we like.

\subsection{Objective}\label{objective}

The study presents design research for developing an AI companion to
help college students find sustainable companies for shopping, saving
and investing. The major contribution of my study is an interactive
artefact (a prototype) informed by design research.

\subsection{Literature Review}\label{literature-review}

\subsubsection{Goals}\label{goals}

Given the goal of designing an app to integrate sustainable shopping,
saving, and investing. The goal of the literature review is to find
insights about the target audience (Taiwanese college students),
understand what kind of sustainable actions are effective, and translate
these into specific ideas for app features. In order to keep track more
easily, each literature review chapter provides \emph{design
implications} which are shown in the results section.

The literature review branches out to 5 main directions and maps out
relationships sources and the literature map, namely Taiwanese college
students, generation-z demographics, sustainability, ecology, ecosystem
services, EU legislation, sustainable finance, sustainable investing,
savings, circular economy, economics, AI, existing sustainability,
software, sustainability--related mobile apps (Apple iOS / Google
Android), and web apps related to sustainable shopping, savings, and
investing; apps using algorithmic interfaces (AI-based UI), design,
UX/UI, service design, sustainable design, speculative design,
interaction design, behavior change, nudge.

\subsection{Student Protests for Climate Justice: Around the World and
In
Taiwan}\label{student-protests-for-climate-justice-around-the-world-and-in-taiwan}

In August 2018, Swedish high-school student Greta Thunberg skipped class
to start a climate justice strike in front of the Swedish parliament
Riksdag. In 2019, Time magazine named Thunberg person of the year for
\emph{creating a global attitudinal shift} towards the environment
(Deutsche Welle, 2019). According to official statistics, 14 million
participants joined her \emph{Fridays for Future} strikes and the
movement expanded to over 7,500 cities around the world (Fridays For
Future, 2025). A survey 64 climate protesters from Norway, the UK, USA,
and Canada, found the climate-justice activists are non-homogeneous
group, displaying differing levels of factual knowledge about climate
change, a broad spectrum of emotions from anger to guilt and hope, with
diverse lifestyles, consumption habits, dietary shifts, and political
leanings (Martiskainen et al., 2020).

\end{figure}%

In Indonesia, which had large protests at the time, now 7 years later
activists are expressing disillusionment and frustration with the lack
of progress and upholding environmental promises. (Dwi Tamara, 2025)
reports on a survey of 382 Gen-Z respondents in 5 areas of Jakarta, with
99.5\% of the respondents having experienced extreme weather events
first-hand, highlighting how respondents were affected by
climate-related calamities, such as frequent flooding, which led to
students missing school days, - education which they are entitled to.
The Sharm El Sheikh climate policy implementation (UNFCCC, 2023b) text
refers to ``human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable
environment''. In Portugal, Estonia, and elsewhere young people have
moved on from strikes to actually taking legal action at the courts
suing companies for the environmental problems they have caused (Flor,
2024).

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{Climate protest in Taipei in May 2019 in front of the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) headquarters}

\end{figure}%

Meanwhile, as the climate-justice protests unfolded around the world, in
Taiwan, the Fridays for Future protests were very small in scale, with
no more than 100-200 people (Hioe, 2019). Meanwhile 2000 Taiwanese
students joined the initative by participating in environmental
activities without protesting (Dai, 2019). This could in part be
explained by Taiwanese culture being deeply influenced by Confucianism,
valuing stability, hierarchical relationships, academic excellence,
effort, and the role of education in achieving social status (R.-H. Xu,
2024). (H.-C. Chang, 2022) goes a step further to say that Taiwanese
youth are effectively unable to stage formal ``strikes'' due to
intersecting cultural constraints: obsession with academic performance,
low awareness of legal strike rights, and parental intervention --- so
they instead reframe actions as campus ``climate actions,'' exercising
agency within those limits. In addition, both Confucianism and Daoism,
the prevalent belief systems in Taiwan, affect education to be
\emph{teacher-centered}, where traditionally the role of students is to
listen and absorb knowledge; in today's society, there's space to open
opportunities for revisiting \emph{dialogue-based} education, where
students would be encouraged to take a more active role and gain
ownership of their education (C.-C. Chang et al., 2023).

\subsection{Taiwanese Educational System in
Numbers}\label{taiwanese-educational-system-in-numbers}

Taiwan has approximately 2 million young adults (Gen-Z, 18-26), and 73\%
percent of them are students attending tertiary education as of 2023,
with a slow increase of enrollment over the past decade (Ministry of
Education of Taiwan, 2024b).

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-4-output-1.pdf}}

As of 2024, Taiwan has a total of 148 universities, colleges, and junior
colleges (Ministry of Education of Taiwan, 2024c). Education funding is
4.26\% of Taiwan's GDP in 2023-24 and has been on a decline for a decade
(Ministry of Education of Taiwan, 2024a). Taiwan has an aging population
and declining birth rates have forced several schools to close down
(Davidson \& Chi-hui, 2024; Goh et al., 2023).

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-5-output-1.pdf}}

While the overall number of students is declining, the share of
international students is increasing.

\subsection{Designing for College Students: Developing
Personas}\label{designing-for-college-students-developing-personas}

Students in the Generation-Z age bracket (abbreviated as Gen-Z or
Zoomers) are born between 1997 and 2012 (Branka Vuleta, 2023). High
levels of technology adoption worldwide (Deyan Georgiev, 2023a). Over
98\% of Gen-Z owns a smartphone while only 80\% of the general world
population does (BankMyCell, 2022; Global Web Index, 2017).

Designing for College Students: Developing Personas. User research makes
extensive use of user \emph{personas} to represent a group of people
with similar attributes. Designers use personas to \emph{articulate
assumptions,} which, if used well, is useful for \emph{user-centered
design}, to create better products. Personas help to reflect on what
kind of \emph{biases} might exist in the design. Within the larger
cohort of college students several different personas could be defined,
for example grouping people by interests, knowledge, habits, levels of
anxiety, and other attributes. Humans have a long list of cognitive
biases, which a good design should take into account.

Many general observations can be made, however to create meaningful
personas, these should be backed up with data. Students ride bicycles
and scooters. Many circular economy service such as YouBike and
transport sharing platforms like Uber are available in Taiwan. Many
students live in dorms and shared housing, meaning their impact per
square meter is low.

\subsection{Taiwanese Youth in the Global Context: Attitudes Towards
Sustainability From Eco-Friendly Diet to Climate
Action}\label{taiwanese-youth-in-the-global-context-attitudes-towards-sustainability-from-eco-friendly-diet-to-climate-action}

Addressing the Research Gap When it Comes to Taiwanese College Students.
There's lack of scientific research when it comes to Taiwanese college
students, not only in English or other foreign languages, but also in
Chinese. Much of the research in Taiwan focuses on younger students,
particularly those in primary and secondary schools. With regards to
issues related to college students and sustainability, even less
research is available. My project hopes to shed some light to how
Taiwanese college students relate to sustainability.

(Kuo-Hua Chen, 2019) compares Taiwan to other countries in terms of
Postmaterialist Index Comparison, noting Taiwanese society is
materialistic.

World Values Survey

(Franzen \& Bahr, 2024) measures \emph{``mean environmental concern''}
to look at decade-level changes in societal environmental attitudes
across countries. Taiwan's general attitudes have stayed almost the same
(slight increase). The UK has had the largest jump in concern.
Curiously, South Korea has had a slight decrease in concern. Slovakia
and Russia were not very concerned with the environment a decade ago and
are even less concerned now.

A large-scale global study by (Anthony Leiserowitz et al., 2022)
administered on Meta's Facebook (n = 108946) reported people in Spain
(65\%), Sweden (61\%), and Taiwan (60\%) believe ``climate change is
mostly caused by human activities''.

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-9-output-1.pdf}}

The largest study to date, conducted by the United Nations across 50
countries, surveying 1.2 million people, distributed through mobile game
ads, showed the majority of people agreeing climate change is an
``emergency'' (UNDP, 2021).

\end{longtable}

At the pre-university level, Taiwanese government has been promoting
environmental education through a green school network; however surveys
at middle school and high school level suggest there is no impact on
\emph{sustainability consciousness} among students in comparison with
regular schools (Olsson et al., 2019). Rather, Taiwanese students are
influenced towards environmental action by \emph{group consciousness}
(T.-Y. Yu et al., 2017). In contrast,(陳珮英, 2003) reports \emph{good
knowledge of sustainable development} topics among \emph{junior high
school students} in Da-an District, Taipei City (n =596). (林建輝.,
2009) similarly reports a positive attitude and good knowledge of
environmental sustainable development among senior \emph{high school
students} towards in Taipei City (n = 328). Several Taiwanese studies
also focus on the physical environment of school campuses, for example
the sustainability of elementary school campuses (潘智謙 \& Pan, 2006).
Elementary-school teachers in Taichung (n = 536), have positive
attitudes towards environmental education are positive, proactive and
demonstrate high awareness; they have participated in many
sustainability-related workshops (Liao et al., 2022).

At the university level, (C.-L. Chen \& Tsai, 2016) reports a
\emph{positive attitude yet moderate knowledge} about \emph{ocean
sustainability} among Taiwanese college students (n = 825). (C.-H. Liu
et al., 2023) studied sustainability behavior of Taiwanese University
students, reporting the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to prevalence of
health issues, also spurred more attention on environmental topics. In a
similar vein, the devastating nuclear disaster in Fukushima, Japan,
after 2011 earthquake, had an effect on Taiwanese energy and
sustainability education (姚 \& 侯, 2011). Taiwanese government launched
the Sustainable Council in 1997 to promote of environmental and
sustainable development; a survey of university-level teachers (n = 100)
in central Taiwan (Taichung, Changhua, and Yunlin) shows a positive
attitude toward environmental sustainability among teachers however
implementation of environmental sustainability practices is from low to
medium range (林美惠. \& 莊, 2015). Taiwanese government has also
launched funding for University Social Responsibility (USR) programs to
train college students in social innovation and local revitalization (D.
Chen \& Chou, 2023; W.-H. Liu et al., 2022).

In general, it could concluded, Taiwanese students and teachers at all
levels of education have a positive attitude towards sustainability,
which is not a very actionable finding.

Comparing college students' education for sustainable development (ESD)
in Taiwan (n = 617) and Sweden (n = 583) found Sweden has a long history
in environmental education while in Taiwan environment became a focus
area with the 1998 educational reform (Berglund et al., 2020).

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-10-output-1.pdf}}

An older study in 5 university in Taipei and Taichung (n = 255) found
78.04\% of respondents consumed beef in the month prior and were
concerned with food safety, freshness, and quality (J. L. Hsu et al.,
2014). (Thiagarajah \& Kay, 2017) reports a general observation in their
abstract (I was unable to access the full study) that most college
students in all observed countries including Taiwan (n = 534) regarded
``\emph{plant-based diets to have health benefits''}.

Internationally, there is extensive research on the attitudes of U.S.
college students towards climate change. (American Press Institute,
2022) reports only 37\% percent of U.S. Generation-Z and Millenials
follow news related to environmental issues. (Schwartz et al., 2022)
reports some adult US students in a small study (18-35, n = 284) express
feelings of insignificance of their actions to achieve any meaningful
impact. (Thomaes et al., 2023) reports U.S. adolescents don't find
sustainability relevant to their daily life. (Ross et al., 2016) says
most people in the U.S. don't act on climate change. ``Action on climate
change has been compromised by uncertainty, aspects of human
psychology''.

(Credit Suisse, 2022) suggests young consumers are more eco-friendly and
drive the speed of change. Yet the Economist has ran a few anonymous
articles calling gen-z green ideals into question ({``How {Gen Z} and
Millennials Spend Their Money,''} 2023; The Economist, 2023). (Wood,
2022) suggests in the U.S. Gen-Z is willing to pay 10\% more for
ethically goods, spend 24\% more on sustainable products than Generation
X and 75\% of Gen Z would prioritize sustainability over brand loyalty.
Meanwhile Gen-Z in the U.S. are heavy users of online fashion shopping,
Chinese cheap online store Shein overtakes Amazon as the most downloaded
shopping app, while clothes resale apps such as Depop and ThredUp grow
in popularity (Alex Reice, 2021). It worth noting, Taiwan is also a
growing market for luxury brands (Karatzas et al., 2019).

(Manchanda et al., 2023) survey (n = 726) administered at shopping malls
in New Delhi, India, found similar levels of sustainability
consciousness between Millenial (n = 206) and Generation-Z (n = 360) age
groups; people with high level of materialism were found to be less
sustainability-conscious; the effect of mindfulness on sustainability
was found to be stronger among females than males, supporting the
hypothesis of the moderating effect of gender.

\subsection{The Experience of Climate Change and Pollution Levels in
Taiwan}\label{the-experience-of-climate-change-and-pollution-levels-in-taiwan}

Taiwan's recent climate challenges with over 4 decades of droughts,
rising air temperatures, and shifting rainfall patterns, have impacted
both water security and the performance of its vital semiconductor
manufacturing industry \hspace{0pt}(Vo \& Liou, 2024). Offshore, marine
heatwaves, ocean acidification, and elevated sea surface temperatures
are intensifying coral bleaching around Taiwan (P.-C. Hsu et al., 2024).
The oceans are crucial for Taiwan to capture carbon emissions. Around
33\% of Taiwanese CO2e emissions is captured by the marine carbon sink,
while the effect of forests in Taiwan needs further study (Hung et al.,
2024).

Similarly to how Northern Europe, including Estonia, is affected by the
Gulf Stream, making the climate warmer, Taiwan is affected by the
Kuroshio (黑潮) warm current of the Pacific Ocean, which helps regulate
the climate and marine ecosystem of the region. The strength and
trajectory of the Kuroshio is influenced by Rossby planetary waves,
driven by the Earth's rotation are crucial to keeping the atmosphere in
balance by helping transfer tropical heat towards Earth's poles and cold
air toward the tropics; interactions between oceanic currents, Rossby
waves and nonlinear \emph{mesoscale eddies,} which form complex
undulations, and their effect on the climate are still not well
understood (Belonenko et al., 2023; J.-Y. Lin et al., 2022; Sheng Liu et
al., 2024; Mensah et al., 2014; Shen et al., 2014; US Department of
Commerce, n.d.; Yuqi Yin et al., 2019). Going back on a larger time
scale, biomarkers in the sediment core around Taiwan are being used to
study variations in climate over past thousands of years (Yueqi Wang et
al., 2021).

In addition to climate extremes, Taiwanese college students are
subjected to high levels of pollution. University campuses are somewhat
healthier than other areas. There are several decades of research on
pollution levels in Taiwan, most with very scary correlations to health.
Taiwan air pollution, the worst (highest PM2.5 concentration) were found
in Changhua (24.5 µg/m³), Tainan (20.9 µg/m³), and Pingtong (20.7 µg/m³)
(Chang Hsiung-feng et al., 2024).

There have been concerns about food safety in Taiwan, with prominent
cases reported in the media and documented in academic literature, where
organic toxins and chemical pollution have entered the food system (I.
Lee, 2024; J.-H. Li \& Ko, 2012; J. Yang et al., 2013).

A recent study demonstrate extreme industrial pollution in numerous
sites at the Hsinchu's Xiang Shan wetland (香山濕地) in Northern Taiwan,
yet considers ecological risk threat to nature and wildlife to be
``moderate'' (Salah-Tantawy et al., 2025). In contrast, (李桂媚, 2022)
reports Taiwan's semiconductor industry employs undisclosed toxic
chemicals under trade-secret claims, which have not undergone
comprehensive health and environmental risk assessments. Previously,
(Y.-H. Liu et al., 2021) reported sediment analyses at the Xiang Shan
wetland found levels of gallium (Ga) ranging from 9,460 to 23,450 µg/kg
(severe contamination) and indium (In) from 4.77 to 37.1 µg/kg (moderate
contamination), amounts which are above natural baselines, indicating
industrial chemical runoff. Earlier studies of semiconductor wastewater
from waterways downstream of the Hsinchu Science Park (which houses over
450 companies' manufacturing facilities) have shown high amounts of at
least 14 heavy metals, with levels of tungsten reaching 400 μg/L in
contrast to the average river concentration of \textless0.1 μg/L (S.-C.
Hsu et al., 2011). The oldest study considered here also found high
levers of arsenic pollution in groundwater (H.-W. Chen, 2006). It's safe
to say, in conclusion, the chemical runoff from manufacturing is a
reality documented by several studies, however the negative health
effects have not yet been clearly established - and studies of other,
less prominent industrial areas of Taiwan, are severely lacking.

The table below illustrates the types of emissions and environmental
impacts large corporations in Taiwan produce. It should be noted, some
of the corporations do buy carbon credits to offset their local adverse
impact; for instance, 台積電 TSCM has purchased carbon credits,
renewable energy, invested in the Taiwan Carbon Exchange to support
greener companies, and joined international reporting initiatives, such
as the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and
Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) (TSMC, 2023).

\subsection{Climate Anxiety and How to
Respond}\label{climate-anxiety-and-how-to-respond}

A growing body of research shows climate anxiety is widespread among
young people, which emotionally can both hinder and motivate sustainable
action. A large worldwide study in (n = 10000, aged 16-25) by (Hickman
et al., 2021) provides evidence the youth is anxious about climate in 10
countries: Australia, Brazil, Finland, France, India, Nigeria,
Philippines, Portugal, the UK, and the USA. Similarly, (Thompson, 2021)
finds young people around the world have climate anxiety. (Whitmarsh et
al., 2022) shows worry about the climate in the UK is generally
widespread (over 40\% of the respondents, n = 1332), while climate
anxiety is highest among young people and is a possible motivator for
climate action. Additionally, (Ogunbode et al., 2022) finds climate
anxiety in 32 countries and also supports the idea that climate anxiety
leads to climate activism. (Thibodeau, 2022): ``In 2021, the BBC polled
1,000 people in Scotland to understand the barriers to taking climate
action. What they found was even though many people were aware of
actions needed to take to address climate change, and had intentions to
their behaviors didn't change. This is a phenomenon called the
intention-action gap.''

(Osaka, 2023) argues \emph{doomerism} is an excuse for climate
in-action. Hope is necessary for people to make changes in their habits
(Marlon et al., 2019). (Seabrook, 2020)~suggests music therapy is useful
in the era of climate crisis, evolving to meet current needs of young
people. (Kjaergard et al., 2014) shows how ``understanding health and
sustainability as a duality, health both creates conditions and is
conditioned by sustainability, understood as economic, social and
environmental sustainability, while on the other hand sustainability
creates and is conditioned by human health''.

A recent special issue of Behavioral Sciences magazine on Behavioral
Science for Climate Change (2025) provides further evidence. A review of
50 studies supports the idea that climate activism shifts public opinion
towards climate concern (Thomas-Walters et al., 2025). Climate change
negative affect braing health through heat, air pollution, extreme
weather; the study finds links to neurological, psychiatric, and
cognitive disorders (Todorova et al., 2025).

When disaster hits we need high levels of \emph{social trust}. being
part of community of trust makes it easier to act in unison. Religion is
a type of community of trust. conversely, that can also have negative
effects, as in Taiwan the expected behaviour of burning joss sticks and
paper money, is a cause of air pollution (C. Tang \& Pan, 2014)

Psychological factors influencing millenials to engage with
sustainability (Naderi \& Van Steenburg, 2018)

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-11-output-1.pdf}}

\subsection{The Attitude-Behavior Gap}\label{the-attitude-behavior-gap}

While people express eco-conscious ideas, it's non-trivial to practice
sustainability in daily life. Translating eco-conscious attitudes into
concrete sustainable actions remains challenging. Empirical evidence
illustrates this gap between intention and behavior. (Park \& Lin, 2020)
positive attitude towards sustainable products does not result in
purchase decisions, shows research of fashion in South Korea. In one
Australian study, green consumers still waste food similarly to the
baseline (McCarthy \& Liu, 2017).

However, changing habits is important if techonology alone is not the
solution. (Deyan Georgiev, 2023b) reports only 30\% of people in the
Gen-Z age group believe technology can resolve all environmental
problems. Even with good intentions, (Munro et al., 2023) finds shoppers
who try to shop sustainably often fail to find sustainable product, in a
systemic literature review of 64 papers from South Korea, Australia, the
UK, the US, and elsewhere.

\subsection{Sustainability Tools in the Taiwanese Context, Digital
Sustainability: Taiwan's Digital Receipt
System}\label{sustainability-tools-in-the-taiwanese-context-digital-sustainability-taiwans-digital-receipt-system}

Musical garbage truck are a success story of the environmental progress
in Taiwan (Helen Davidson \& Chi Hui Lin, 2022). Indeed, they are a
\emph{user interface innovation} and the main way how people in Taiwan
interact with sustainability issues.

The popular narrative about Taiwan recounts the story of the economic
and environmental transformation of the country. In the late 1980s
during the heights of an economic boom Taiwan became famous as the
Taiwanese Miracle (臺灣奇蹟) (Gold, 1986; P.-L. Tsai, 1999). By the
early 1990s another less flattering nickname appeared: ``garbage
island'', for the piles of trash covering the streets and overflowing
landfills (Ngo, 2020; Rapid Transitions Alliance, 2019). In the two
decades that followed, from 1998 to 2018, Taiwan made progress in
municipal waste management, rising to the status of a world-leader in
recycling (2nd \emph{effective recycling rate} after Germany); in
addition to an effective recycling system, the average waste amount
generated per person by 700g (from 1140g to 400g) per day; nonetheless,
industrial recycling rates were less stellar, standing at 80\% in 2020
and there were unrealized opportunities in using industry 4.0
technologies, such as internet of things (IoT) sensors for better waste
tracking (Bui et al., 2023; C.-Y. Wu et al., 2021).

Progress in sustainability is possible but achieving results takes time
and innovation. (Rapid Transitions Alliance, 2019) credits the Taiwanese
Homemakers United Foundation (財團法人主婦聯盟環境保護基金會) for
initiating the transformation in 1987, suggesting a small group of
people can have an outsized impact on the whole country. Their activity
didn't stop there and (財團法人主婦聯盟環境保護基金會, 2020) recounts a
timeline of their achievements on their website until the present day.

{``{獨家觀察－電子發票年減碳量 相當2,700座大安森林公園}''} (2025)
reports 54.03\% of invoices in Taiwan are digital. Since 2021 digital
receipts are mandatory for all businesses. Taiwan's longstanding receipt
lottery also has specific prizes available only for digital receipts
(\emph{行動支付結合雲端發票 節能減碳最環保{\textbar}經理人}, 2018).
Several other countries, such as Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Sweden,
Italy, Portugal, Brazil, Mexico, have comparable systems in use.

\subsection{Trends in Taiwanese Companies from Industry to Online
Shopping}\label{trends-in-taiwanese-companies-from-industry-to-online-shopping}

In the intensifying competition of online shopping in Taiwan,
(聯合新聞網, 2024) predicts Momo and Coupang will compete for Taiwanese
market leadership, with Coupang increasingly stepping on Shopee's and
MOMO's toes, as per ({``順風婦產科 순풍 산부인과 (@Followwindlover) on
{Threads},''} 2024).

Across online and offline, KANTAR reports Taiwan's consumer spending on
fast-moving consumer-goods (FMCG) grew over 5\% in 2024, speeding up
towards the end of the year: +2.5\% in Q1, +4.1\% in Q2, +5.7 \% in Q3
and +9.1\% in Q4, with e-commerce crossing the 20 \% share mark
(traditionally FMCG are purchased physical stores, as convenience stores
are so readily available all over Taiwan) (foodNEXT, 2024; Kantar
Worldpanel, 2024; 動腦Brain.com.tw, 2024; 食力 foodNEXT, 2025).

Taiwan has been on a path of change, striving to become more
sustainable. Between 1970 and 2019, emitting CO2 was largely a
prerequisite for economic growth in Taiwan (T. Chang et al., 2023).
Since the 1990s, Taiwan is a net CO2e exporter through emissions
embedded in the industrial production oriented economy (Huang et al.,
2020). Starting in 2023, Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission's
(FSC) added ``requirements for Taiwan's corporates to disclose their
carbon emissions,'' (Reformosatw, 2024). Most recently, the Taiwanese
environmental ministry has been cracking down on illegal waste, with
over 70 cases being prosecuted (環境部, 2025).

TIME Magazine and Statista collaborative \emph{``World's Most
Sustainable Companies Of 2024''} includes 17 Taiwanese companies (Alana
Semuels, 2024).

\subsection{Financial Literacy Worldwide and Among Taiwanese
Youth}\label{financial-literacy-worldwide-and-among-taiwanese-youth}

A recent nationwide study (n = 1997) titled Youth Financial Health
Basics (青少年財務健康基礎大調查) jointly conducted by the Taipei Fubon
Bank and the Parent-Child Innovation Center (親子天下教育創新中心)
between February 11 and March 9, 2025 found that over 65\% of secondary
schools incorporated financial-literacy courses into their curricula
however 64\% of Taiwanese youths (aged 15--18) exhibit low confidence
and understanding of financial products and face significant fraud risk,
with nearly 1/5 of the respondents encountering a scam in the past year,
while 18\% suffered actual financial losses (江昭倫, 2025; 陳美君,
n.d.).

Importantly for designing a financial app, while 80\% of the survey
respondents had received financial education at school, 90\% of the
students deemed the primary learning channel about financial knowledge
to be on social media; and only 15\% remember to have learned about
credit-card usage (江昭倫, 2025).

In a much older study, I-Cheng Yeh (2009) analyzed usage data from
30,000 credit-card clients at an undisclosed major Taiwanese bank to
predict next-month defaults, using 6 data-mining techniques including
ANNs (AI Neural Networks) (Yeh \& Lien, 2009). Because of the age of the
study there's no Gen-Z data. People aged 18-26 at the time would be
Millenials or Gen-X by now. the data was donated by (Yeh, 2016) and
roughly 1 in 5 credit card clients (22.1\%) of the dataset defaulted on
their payment in the next month. Among the 9,618 clients aged 18--29 at
the time of the study, 2,197 defaulted on their next‐month payment,
yielding a default rate of 22.8\%, slightly higher than the overall
average. Meanwhile, among the 5,127 clients aged 18--26, 1,285
defaulted, yielding a rate of 25.1\%, considerable higher than their
older counterparts. Finally, among the 1,558 clients aged 18--23, 430
defaulted, a rate of 27.6\%, pointing to a trend of younger people
having higher default rates.

A over-the-phone study (n = 3000) conducted in 2022, found Taiwanese
savings habits to have polarized, with over 60\% either having no
savings whatsoever or saving more than 1/2 of their annual income; 27\%
of respondents reported total savings below NT\$40,000; young adults'
(aged 20--29) were the only group whose financial risk worsened, with
43\% of the respondents having extremely low financial literacy,
described as 金融文盲 (near ``financial illiterate'') (中央社, 2022).

Taiwanese. Their longtitudinal study, with the latest survey conducted
in 2022 (n = 2014; 1055 high-school; 959 university) rated financial
literacy among all youths 56.3 out of 100 (53.8 in 2016 and 56.7 in

Internationally, there's evidence young people have money. In the United
States, the combined annual consumer spending of Gen-Z and Millennials
was over \$2.5 Trillion in 2020 (YPulse, 2020). Over the decade from
2020 to 2030, in the U.S., UK, and Australia, Millennials are projected
to inherit \$30 Trillion USD from their parents (Calastone, 2020).
(Steverman, 2022) puts the inheritance figure between 2022-2045 at an
higher \$73 Trillion USD. There's also some evidence of investment
interest, however with a large geographic variance. According to a
(Calastone, 2020) study (n = 3000) surveying people in the millennial
age group between ages 23 and 35 in Europe (UK, France, Germany),
U.S.A., Hong Kong, and Australia, 48\% of respondents located in Hong
Kong owned financial securities (such as stocks) while the figure was
just 10\% in France.

\subsection{Social Media Usage, Trends, Memes, Media Currents, and Youth
Empowerment}\label{social-media-usage-trends-memes-media-currents-and-youth-empowerment}

The term ``meme,'' first coined by Richard Dawkins in 1976 in his book
``The Selfish Gene'' to describe units of cultural evolution, analogous
to that of biological evolution, which may evolve by natural selection,
and now encompasses internet artifacts and even stocks. Beyond mere
entertainment, memes have emerged as an academic discipline, where memes
are sampled, coded, and analysed from cultural and ethical viewpoints,
among others (Zidani \& Miltner, 2022). (Peters-Lazaro et al., 2020)
argues memes are no merely jokes but tools for communal critique and
collective visioning. suggesting that Taiwanese Gen-Z memes scaffold
deeper conversations about consumerism, climate action, and social
change. Memes from daily life, business to war, are relevant to
penetrating through the noise of the web.

In Taiwan, homegrown memes may start with global templates but quickly
take on a local flavor. (劉芸嘉, 2024)'s 2021 study of 150 Taiwanese
memes written in Mandarin shows most rely on friendly and indirect
humor: inside jokes and wordplay that bond peers together.
(朱映潔(Ying-Chieh Chu), 2021) surveyed 737 Taiwanese Facebook users and
discovered that a meme's funniness, shareability, and shock value
``hellish gags'' (地獄梗) drive people to post it for social approval.
(胡綺珍, 2024) collected 217 ``tired of life'' / ``I'm just trash'' meme
texts from Instagram and PTT, then interviewed 13 Gen-Z enthusiasts,
revealing how self-deprecating jokes help Gen Z cope with stress, feel
part of a group, and quietly push back against social pressure. Memes
have a long history, and even almost a decade ago in 2016, a casual news
comment---like the ``canoing man'' (泛舟哥) remark during a typhoon
exploded into LINE stickers and PTT threads, proving that Taiwanese can
transform everyday media moments into collective satire or
tongue-in-cheek commentary (黃意能 \& 黃曉琪, 2016).

Internationally, the sustainability-focused topics ``underconsumption''
and ``deinfluencing'' were trending on TikTok in 2024 however have since
subdued (Fares et al., 2024; TikTok, 2024b, 2024a). While this
particular trend may be over, memes still hold potential for
communicating about sustainability to young Taiwanese. Still, looking at
older international data, (Zannettou et al., 2018) built a large-scale
machine-learning pipeline to trace the origin of memes in the US, with
160M images and 2.6B posts within about 1 year (July 2016-2017) from
Twitter, Reddit, 4chan and Gab, finding that often memes originate from
fringe communities and then spread across mainstream media, highlighting
how fringe communities can be surprising impactul.

In Taiwan, Internet usage among young people is nearly ubi universal,
with over to 98\% of 18--29 (roughly Gen-Z) year‐olds reporting they
have gone online at least once recently, and close to 96\% of
respondents aged 18-29 used some form of social media
(\textbf{TWNIC2023?}).

\end{longtable}

(林高賢, 2024) analyzed (n = 1175) Taiwanese high school students,
mostly aged Gen-Z, finding that Instagram (IG) dominates, used by close
to 85\% percent of the respondents; they use IG for about 2 hours per
day, 5-6 days per week; moreover, respondents often feel anxious (1-2
days per week), and anxiety correlates with several motivations of using
IG, such as recording life moments, documenting travel, food, and
fitness with photos, was tied to higher anxiety, possibly related to the
photo-centric self-presentation on Instagram, why can be theorized to
heighten sensitivity to feedback and criticism. In contrast, (陳思凝,
2023) conducted a survey of 458 Taiwanese Gen Z Instagram users, finding
that higher Instagram use intensity is directly associated with greater
online subjective well-being; however, intense use also leads to
information overload and social comparison, which induce social media
fatigue and in turn erode well-being; moreover, users' perceived
intimacy with the platform amplifies the link between use intensity and
social comparison frequency. An online survey by (廖柏雅, 2024) (where
the Gen-Z cohort n = 125) found respondents to be highly motivated by
social and entertainment use; the user's fear of missing out (FoMO) was
found to be related to the motive; e.g.~people with social and
entertainment drives experience greater FoMO than those motivated
primarily by information seeking.

A large-scale (n = 2075) representative face-to-face survey among people
aged 18 to 93 years in Taiwan (no age-based categorization was published
for Gen-Z specifically), found that in general sharing one's thoughts
online (known academically as ``self-disclosure'') boosts perceived
social support and significantly boosts bonding and bridging social
capital, which increases life satisfaction and lowers loneliness (樊一寧
et al., 2024). Conversely, in Japan, while not directly comparable,
Gen-Z reports wanting privacy and 75\% feel others overshare on social
media and 49 percent were concerned about their personal data (McKinsey
\& Company, 2022).

\subsection{AI Usage Among Taiwanese
Students}\label{ai-usage-among-taiwanese-students}

A survey of college students in March 8--10, 2023 at the Chung Yuan
Christian University (n = 983) in Taoyuan (Northern Taiwan), yielded the
following results: 66\% of the students had used ChatGPT, with the the
top use cases being summarization (31\%), translation of articles
(28\%), and writing reports (24\%) (CYCU, 2023; 許維寧, 2023). However,
in terms of AI adoption, this data can be considered out-dated. ChatGPT
was first released to the public on November 30, 2022, so the students
had had only about 3 months to try it out (OpenAI, 2022). At the time,
the GPT-3.5 model was available; the revolutionary GPT‑4 was released to
the public on March 14, 2023, (OpenAI, 2023).

In a more recent large-scale survey focusing on AI literacy administered
to the general public (n = 2174) found that only 26\% of the respondents
had used ChatGPT in the past 3 months (in comparison with the 25\% from
a similar survey administered in the previous year); younger people had
higher usage patterns, 53\% for 18-29 and 37\% 30-39; meanwhile, 69\% of
respondents believed they could tell the difference between AI-generated
and non-AI content and 73\% supported some type of government
regulations for AI (HakkaNews, 2024).

A Chinese study from two authors at the Minzu University and Beijing
Normal University reports they recruited anonymous Taiwanese college
students (n = 916) on the Chinese Credamo platform from the Taiwanese
IP-space (ChatGPT is blocked in Mainland China, Macau, and Hong Kong) to
compare ChatGPT vs.~Google for academic use among Taiwanese students:
their findings show a clear preference for ChatGPT overall, which
students deemed more flexible (meanwhile some older students still
preferred Google) and Random Forest and LightGBM-based modeling
predicted tool choice by three main factors: 1) GenAI fluency,
2)awareness of GenAI hallucinations, and 3) user age; their
recommendations include 1) support critical-thinking among users, and 2)
design hybrid chat+search user interfaces with higher reliability
(Kelly, 2024; Qiao \& Lee, 2024; M. Zhang \& Yang, 2024). In the US, an
older study of young adults (Millenials at the time) highlights how they
\emph{``use Google as a reference point for ease of use and
simplicity'',} (Kate Moran, 2016). The web now has several generations
of native users, and some older usage patterns which older digital
natives are used to, may take time to change.

In Sweden, a large-scale (n = 5894) survey across several Swedish
universities showed college students' attitudes towards AI assistants
(ChatGPT was by far the most prevalent app, 95 \% of respondents had
heard of ChatGPT and 35 \% used it regularly); 55.9\% held a positive
attitude toward AIs; integrity was a hotly debated question, 62\%
calling AI use in exams ``cheating,'' but 60\% rejecting an outright
ban, and 58\% saying it doesn't violate the purpose of education (Stöhr
et al., 2024).

\subsection{The Roots of Sustainability in
Environmentalism}\label{the-roots-of-sustainability-in-environmentalism}

\emph{``Nachhaltigkeit''} - \emph{sustainability} in German - was likely
the first use of the concept of preserving natural resources, conceived
by a tax accountant Hannß Carl von Carlowitz in 1713 in his seminal book
on forestry - \emph{Sylvicultura oeconomica -}, referring to the goal of
achieving prudent forest management practices in his native Saxony in
Southeastern Germany, which at the time was under severe
\emph{deforestation} pressure from mining, ship-building and
agricultural production (Gottschlich \& Friedrich, 2014; Hannß Carl von
Carlowitz, 1713). This particular field of sustainability study is now
known as \emph{sustainable yield of natural capital}. The
\emph{principal} of the natural resource being managed, such as in
fishing and forestry, shouldn't be over-harvested in order to maintain
\textbf{\emph{ecosystem services}} - a contemporary term from the theory
of \emph{natural capital}, referring to benefits humans receive from the
stock of world's natural resources (Peter Kareiva et al., 2011).

Defining sustainability perhaps more poetically, the American wildlife
ecologist Aldo Leopold proposed the idea of \emph{land ethics} in 1972
as \emph{``{[}a{]} thing is right when it tends to preserve the
integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong
when it tends otherwise''} in his landmark work \emph{A Sand County
Almanac} (Leopold, 1972). In a similar vein, the 1987 United Nations'
Brundtland Report titled ``\emph{Our Common Future''} defined
\emph{sustainable development} as \emph{``Development that meets the
needs of the present without compromising the ability of future
generations to meet their own needs''} (World Commission on Environment
and Development, 1987). Given these varied ideas for over 300 years, I
believe some percentage of people have been concerned with our planet's
natural environment and its preservation already for centuries. Yet, it
is only in the last 100 and so years that human activities have begun to
affect Earth's systems on a previously unseen scale - termed
\emph{Anthropocene} -, necessitating a deeper understanding of
human-nature interactions, such as in the case of climate change, which
is rapidly changing the face of our living environments.

\subsection{Measuring and Visualizing Earth's Climate
Systems}\label{measuring-and-visualizing-earths-climate-systems}

Studies of Earth's climate go back for over 200 years, starting with
Alexander von Humboldt,the founder of climatology, who revolutionized
cartography by inventing the first \emph{isothermal maps} in 1816; these
maps showed areas with similar temperature, variations in altitude and
seasons in different colors (Honton, 2022) now available as 3D computer
models(\emph{Alexander von {Humboldt}'s Original Isotherms Circa 1838},
2023). Already in 1896, the Nobel Prize winner Svante Arrhenius first
calculated how an increase in CO\textsubscript{2} levels could have a
warming effect on our global climate (T. R. Anderson et al., 2016;
Wulff, 2020). In 1938, Guy Stewart Callendar was the first scientist to
demonstrate the warming of Earth's land surface as well as linking the
production of fossil fuels to increased CO\textsubscript{2}e and
changing climate (Hawkins \& Jones, 2013). Early scientists pioneered
climate modeling by calculating the first climate interactions which
precede today's complex computer-based \emph{Earth System Models (ESMs)}
that integrate the various Earth systems and cycles run on
supercomputers (T. R. Anderson et al., 2016).

\begin{figure}[H]

}

\caption{Humboldt's Naturgemälde, early data visualization of ecology,
rain, temperature, elevation, etc}

\end{figure}%

Environmental activists have been calling attention to global warming
for decades, yet the world has been slow to act (McKibben, 1989). While
the scientific case for human-induced climate change was building, it
took 120 years after Arrhenius' calculations, until the Paris Climate
Agreement in 2016, that countries came to an agreement on non-binding
targets on keeping CO\textsubscript{2} levels 1.5 °C below
pre-industrial levels (defined as 1850--1900)(United Nations, 2016).
Even though awareness of Earth's warming climate was growing ever
stronger, the CO\textsubscript{2} emissions kept rising too. The
hockey-stick growth of CO\textsubscript{2} concentration since the
industrial revolution is clear in the data from 1958 onward, following a
steady annual increase, called the \emph{Keeling Curve} (Keeling \&
Keeling, 2017). Written records of global temperature measurements are
available starting from the 1880s, when temperatures began to be
documented in ship logs (Brohan et al., 2012). Finally, although perhaps
less accurately, temperature estimations from tree-trunks allow some
comparisons with the climate as far back as 2000 years ago (Rubino et
al., 2019).

April 2025 was Earth's 2nd-warmest April on record, with global
temperatures reaching 1.32°C above the 20th-century average, driven by
persistent El Niño conditions and record-high ocean temperatures
(Masters, 2025). This warming aligns with growing concerns about Earth's
energy imbalance, which recent satellite data suggest has nearly doubled
since 2005; more heat is being trapped in the climate system than is
being radiated back to space (Mauritsen et al., 2025). Compounding the
issue, 3 key NASA climate satellites responsible for monitoring Earth's
energy budget are nearing the end of their operational life with no
replacement missions currently planned, raising alarms about the
continuity and reliability of future climate data (Harvey, 2025).
Likewise, funding for the Scripps Institute, responsible for the Keeling
Curve, is under threat, according to its caretaker, Ralph Keeling.

The Keeling Curve apparatus measures absorbion of infrared light, which
allows one to detect the amount of CO2 in the air. It also has an
advanced calibration system where it makes measurements in air with a
known quantity of gases (Worthington, 2025b).

The latest data from 2023 shows our current world population of 8
Billion people emitted 37.2 gigatonnes (i.e.~billion metric tons) of
CO\textsubscript{2}e per year, the highest emissions recorded in history
(Statista, 2023a). In order to limit global warming to 1.5 °C as agreed
by the world nations in Paris, removal of 5-20 gigatons of
CO\textsubscript{2}e per year would be needed according to reduction
pathways calculated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) (UNFCCC. Secretariat, 2022; Wade et al., 2023). Yet, most
countries are missing the mark (Climate Analytics \& NewClimate
Institute, 2023; United Nations Environment Programme, 2023). The
European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) reports 1.5 °C
global warming has already been breached in 2024 temperatures ({``First
Time World Exceeds 1.{5C} Warming Limit over 12-Month Period,''} 2024;
\emph{World's First Year-Long Breach of Key 1.{5C} Warming Limit},
2024). Given the current pace of climate change action, the G7 countries
(Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, United States)
are heading for 2.7 °C of warming by 2050 (CDP, 2022).

(United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), 2021) reported as of 2021
updated national climate pledges (NDCs) and other mitigation measures
are projected to lead to a global temperature increase of approximately
2.7°C by 2100, significantly surpassing the Paris Agreement's
aspirational goal to keep global warming below 1.5°C this century;
effective implementation of net-zero emissions pledges could still keep
warming around 2.2°C (approaching the Paris Agreement's goal of below
2°C), if countries cut methane emissions from fossil fuel, waste, and
agricultural sectors, bridging the current emissions gap - and carbon
markets might significantly cut emissions, if they are governed by clear
rules ensuring genuine emission reductions, alongside transparent
systems for monitoring and tracking progress - however, numerous
national climate strategies postpone substantial action until after
2030. A year later, the 2022 Emissions Gap report showed a somewhat
worsening situation, with existing national pledges leading the world
for around 2.8 °C of warming by 2100 (United Nations Environment
Programme, 2022)

Earth's physical systems are very sensitive to small changes in
temperature, which was not understood until the 1970s(McKibben, 2006). A
comprehensive review of evidence from paleoclimate records until current
time, including ocean, atmosphere, and land surface of points towards
substantial climate change if high levels of greenhouse gas emissions
continue, termed by the authors as \emph{climate sensitivity} (Sherwood
et al., 2020). Global warming may lead to the slowing down and complete
stop of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) which
helps maintain climate stability (Ditlevsen \& Ditlevsen, 2023). Apart
from CO\textsubscript{2}, reduction of other atmospheric pollutants,
such as non-CO\textsubscript{2} greenhouse gases (GHGs) and short-lived
climate pollutants (SLCPs) is required for climate stability (J. Lin et
al., 2022).

(Armstrong McKay et al., 2022a; TED, 2024) warns that climate is not a
linear system, rather there are several non-linear climate tipping
points, where change accelerates: at the current warming ice‐sheet
collapse, permafrost thaw, Amazon dieback and coral‐reef loss are likely
to tip between 1.5 °C and 2 °C, underscoring that the Paris Agreement
range is far from a safe limit. (Armstrong McKay et al., 2022b)
synthesize paleoclimate records, observations, and model projections to
revise and rank both global ``core'' and regional ``impact'' climate
tipping elements by their warming thresholds, visualized in the chart
below.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Measuring CO\textsubscript{2}e
Emissions}{Measuring CO2e Emissions}}\label{measuring-co2e-emissions}

Technology improves and measurements have become more accurate yet
CO\textsubscript{2}e emissions are not yet completely accounted for.
(Crippa et al., 2020) reports the latest figures CO\textsubscript{2}e
from the EU's Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research
(EDGAR). The EU Copernicus satellite system reveals new greenhouse
emissions previously undetected (Daniel Värjö, 2022). \emph{Copernicus
Climate Change Service (C3S) provides ``{[}n{]}ear-real time updates of
key global climate variables}''(The Copernicus Climate Change Service,
2024).

One major cross-cutting category the IPCC tracks separately is LULUCF
(Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry). Depending on whether forests
are being cleared or restored, LULUCF can act as a net greenhouse-gas
source or as a powerful carbon sink that removes CO₂ from the
atmosphere. LULUCF also links to biodiversity protection. (Y. Chen et
al., 2023) looked at the Poyang Lake in China between 2010-2020, finding
ecosystem vulnerability rose by 18\% with human activities (land-use
change, urban expansion, components of LULUCF, also reported in
international media, see (Scarr \& Sharma, 2021) for images) as the
dominant driver, followed by climate factors. (Xie et al., 2021) mapped
pollution sources in 14 vulnerable areas in China, including the Poyang
Lake, and underlined the need for real-time monitoring of ecosytem
health.

Emissions production is highly unequal, with \emph{``{[}t{]}he world's
top 1\% of emitters produce over 1000 times more CO2 than the bottom
1\%''} (IEA, 2023a). The share of CO\textsubscript{2} emissions among
people around the world is highly unequal across the world (referred to
as \emph{Carbon Inequality}). (Chancel, 2022) reports ``one-tenth of the
global population is responsible for nearly half of all emissions, half
of the population emits less than 12\%''. Information and communications
technology (ICT) sector is an example of carbon inequality, where
emerging economies bear 82\% of the emissions, developed countries gain
58\% of value, of the over 300 million PCs sold per year (Bajarin, 2022;
X. Zhou et al., 2022).

\emph{Scoping} CO\textsubscript{2e} \emph{emissions} into 4 main
categories helps to organize calculating CO\textsubscript{2e} emissions
and corresponding reduction targets by looking at direct and indirect
emissions separately. The U.S. National Public Utilities Council (NPUC)
decarbonization report provides a useful categorization of
\emph{emission scopes} applicable to companies which helps organizing
emission reduction schemes (National Public Utilities Council, 2022)
based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol defined in the 1990s (GHG Protocol,
n.d.). For example, for consumers in Australian states and territories
in 2018, 83\% of the GHG emissions are Scope 3, meaning indirect
emissions in the value chain (Goodwin et al., 2023). A newer concept is
Scope 4 emissions also known as avoided emissions, proposed by the World
Resources Institute (WRI) in 2013 (Plan A, n.d.).

Countries have agreed up CO\textsubscript{2e} Reduction Targets known as
Country-Level Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). While most
countries have not reached their Nationally Determined Contributions,
the Climate Action Tracker data portal allows to compare countries by
their NDC peformance (Climate Analytics \& NewClimate Institute, 2023).
(Fransen et al., 2022) notes that the majority of Nationally Determined

international community.

Fossil fuels are what powers humanity as well as the largest source of
CO\textsubscript{2} emissions. (IEA, 2022) reports ``Global
CO\textsubscript{2} emissions from energy combustion and industrial
processes rebounded in 2021 to reach their highest ever annual level. A
6\% increase from 2020 pushed emissions to 36.3 gigatonnes''. As on June
2023, fossil fuel based energy makes up 82\% of energy and is still
growing (Institute, 2023). The 425 largest fossil fuel projects
represent a total of over 1 gigatons in CO\textsubscript{2} emissions,
40\% of which were new projects Kühne et al. (2022). Tilsted et al.
(2023) expects the fossil fuel industry to continue grow even faster. In
July 2023, the U.K. granted hundreds of new oil and gas of project
licenses in the North Sea ({``Rishi {Sunak} to Green-Light Hundreds of
New Oil and Gas Licenses in {North Sea},''} 2023).

(Ember, 2025) Ember's Electricity Data Explorer shows Taiwanese energy
usage based on data from Taiwanese government, visualizing the growth in
gas, wind, and solar, and decline of coal and nuclear power; however,
while declining, coal remains the leading power source for Taiwan.
Climate pledges made by international companies present in Taiwan mean
they need large amounts of green energy to meet their sustainability
goals. For instance, Google worked with the government of Taiwan to
change the laws to allow direct power procurement by foreign companies;
the current plan being to install 1 gigawatt of solar power fully
pre-purchased by the newly formed company created by BlackRock and
Google for boosting AI development as reported by (S. Chiang, 2024;
Jessop et al., 2024; 永鑫能源 New Green Power, 2022). More recently,
Google also purchased 10MW of geothermal energy for its Taiwanese AI
chip projects, doubling current Taiwanese geothermal capacity
(Hagström-Ilievska, Apr. 17, 2025 18:00; Potter, 2025; Jeffery Wu \&
Thompson, 2025). Geothermal energy provides 24/7 clean energy from the
Earth's core, however is limited due to lack of acccess; Taiwan happens
to be in geologically active spot on the ring of fire, where drilling
for geothermal energy is more feasible (M. Chang \& Hsiao, 2025; L,
2025).

\subsubsection{Carbon Accounting, Emissions Trading
Schemes}\label{carbon-accounting-emissions-trading-schemes}

Trading CO\textsubscript{2e} emissions can be divided into 2 categories,
namely \emph{Compliance Carbon Markets} (CCM) and \emph{Voluntary Carbon
Markets} (VCM). The legislative baseline for Compliance Carbon Markets
is so low, people want to retire more CO\textsubscript{2e}, which they
can do through \emph{Voluntary Carbon Markets.}

As of 2024 there's no single global CO\textsubscript{2} trading market
but rather several local markets as described in the table below. Most
of the world is not part of a CO\textsubscript{2} market.

\end{longtable}

The price of CO\textsubscript{2e} differs across markets, as assigning a
monetary value to reducing CO\textsubscript{2e} emissions depends on
several variables. (Stern, 2022b) argues carbon-neutral economy needs
higher CO\textsubscript{2e} prices and believes (Rennert et al., 2022)
CO\textsubscript{2e} price per ton should be 3,6x higher that it is
currently. Contrary, (Ritz, 2022) argues optimal CO\textsubscript{2}
prices could be highly asymmetric, low in some countries and high (above
the social cost of CO\textsubscript{2e}) in countries where production
is very polluting. The total size of carbon markets reached 949 billion
USD in 2023, including Chinese, European, and North American
CO\textsubscript{2} trading (LSEG \& Susanna Twidale, 02/12/2024, 02:37
PM).

The prices between compliance and voluntary markets differ
substantially.

Voluntary Carbon Markets are a decentralized system where private
entities voluntarily buy and sell carbon credits (ICVCM, 2025). Carbon
credits are useful for private companies who wish to claim \emph{carbon
neutrality, climate positivity}, or other related claim, which might be
viewed in good light by their clients or allow the companies to adhere
to certain legislative requirements. In the simplest terms, a carbon
credit represents 1T of CO2 that has been prevented from entering the
atmosphere - or has been removed from circulation (aka Carbon Credit
Retirement) (Anna Watson, 2022, 2023). However it's important to look at
the details of these deal as Voluntary Carbon Markets (VCM) lack
standardization and transparency (Ela Khodai, 2023). For example, Flickr
only invested around 3000 USD in carbon credits and got a carbon-neutral
rating, which hardly seems enough for an organization of its size
(Climate Neutral, 2024).

Markets are centered around carbon credits, nature-backed financial
derivatives dependent on science-based methodologies for measurement,
reporting, and verification (MRV), which are managed and regularly
updated by certification organizations such as Gold Standard, Verra, and
others. Some standards released in the past few years include the Verra
Agricultural Land Management methodology for Verified Carbon Standard
(VCS) (Verra, 2023). Gold Standard recently release a methodology for
Mangrove-based carbon credits (Gold Standard, 2024). Regen Network
released a methodology for regenerative grazing systems, proposing
remote-sensing analysis with field-sampled soil carbon data, quantifing
GHG sequestration and ecological co-benefits (biodiversity,
water-infiltration, etc.) for robust MRV and carbon-credit issuance
(\emph{Methodology for {GHG} \& {Co-Benefits} in {Grazing Systems}},
2022). KlimaDAO, unhappy with the current standards, published ``An open
call for alternative carbon standards'' inviting carbon-credit issuers
and communities to propose next-generation registry frameworks and
leverage blockchain for transparency, liquidity and interoperability in
the voluntary carbon market (KlimaDAO, 2023a).

For the individual person, there's no direct access to
CO\textsubscript{2} markets. However, brokers do buy large amounts of
carbon credits to resell in smaller quantities to retail investors.
Facilitating citizens' access to CO\textsubscript{2} emissions trading
may be an efficient method to organize large-scale CO\textsubscript{2}
retiring (Rousse, 2008). (Sipthorpe et al., 2022) compares traditional
and blockchain-based solutions to carbon trading, arguqing that
blockchain solutions for CO2 markets are nearing maturity, and offer
many improvements, such as enhancing transparency, trust, and
efficiency.

CO\textsubscript{2e} credits have given rise to the Carbon Accounting
industry, to help companies meet legal emissions reduction targets in
Compliance Carbon Markets, with many companies like Watershed, Greenly,
and Sustaxo providing services. (Quatrini, 2021) admits sustainability
assessments are often complex and may give flawed results. Nonetheless,
CO\textsubscript{2} emission reduction has the added positive effect of
boosting corporate morale (J. Cao et al., 2023).

There are many companies which facilitate buy carbon credits as well as
a few organizations focused on carbon credit verification. In Estonia,
startups Arbonic and Single.Earth are trialing this approach in several
forests. The most established certifiers or carbon credits include the
Verified Carbon Standard (VCS), the Gold Standard, Climate Action
Reserve (CAR)‍, and the American Carbon Registry (ACR).

\emph{``Carbon pricing is not there to punish people,''} says Lion Hirth
(Lion Hirth, n.d.). \emph{``It's there to remind us, when we take
travel, heating, consumption decisions that the true cost of fossil
fuels comprises not only mining and processing, but also the damage done
by the CO\textsubscript{2} they release.''} Long term cost of
insufficient climate action is more than short-term gains from delaying
efforts to reduce carbon emissions. In addition to the damages from
global warming, the fossil energy production that's a large part of
global CO2 emissions has caused several high-profile pollution events.
Large ones that got international news coverage include Exxon Valdez and
Deepwater Horizon.

\subsubsection{Overconsumption \textgreater{} Earth's
Boundaries}\label{overconsumption-earths-boundaries}

Excessive consumer lifestyle - \emph{overconsumption} - is one of the
main drivers of climate change and environmental destruction, with
\emph{``2/3 of global GHG emissions are directly and indirectly linked
to household consumption, with a global average of about 6 tonnes
CO\textsubscript{2} equivalent per capita''} , according to (Ivanova et
al., 2020; Renee Cho, 2020). An older study put the number as high as
60\% percent (Ivanova et al., 2016) while (Ellen MacArthur Foundation,
Material Economics, 2019)'s models 45\% show of CO\textsubscript{2}
equivalent emissions come from our shopping; produced by companies to
make the products we consume. (Keeble, 1988) reported in April 1987 that
\emph{`residents in high-income countries lead lifestyles incompatible
with planetary boundaries'}.

While the numbers on overconsumption are clear, the debate on
overconsumption is so polarized, it's difficult to have a meaningful
discussion of the topic (Ianole \& Cornescu, 2013). Environmental risks
from human activities are known as Anthropogenic Threat Complexes (ATCs)
(Bowler et al., 2020). With the trend of urbanization, it's not
surprising (people living in) cities are responsible for 80\% of the
emissions (Rosales Carreón \& Worrell, 2018). (Moberg et al., 2019)
reports daily human activities emission contribution on average in four
European countries (France, Germany, Norway and Sweden).

Earth's growing population reached 8 Billion people In November 2022 and
population projections by predict 8.5B people by 2030 and 9.7B by 2050
(The Economic Times, 2022; United Nations Department of Economic and
Social Affairs, Population Division, 2022). Indeed, making
\emph{anything} consumes natural resources, which are limited on planet
Earth. (Hassoun et al., 2023) forecasts increase of global food demand
by 62\% driven by the impact of climate change. Yet, while population
growth puts higher pressure on Earth's resources, some researchers
propose the effect is higher from wasteful lifestyles than the raw
number of people (Cardinale et al., 2012). Meanwhile others, such as
(Cafaro et al., 2022), believe \emph{{[}o{]}verpopulation is a major
cause of biodiversity loss and smaller human populations are necessary
to preserve what is left.''}

\subsubsection{Plastic Pollution}\label{plastic-pollution}

Overconsumption is also one of the root causes of plastic pollution.
(Ford et al., 2022) and (Lavers et al., 2022) find strong links between
climate change and marine plastic pollution \emph{``along with other
stressors that threaten the resilience of species and habitats sensitive
to both climate change and plastic pollution''}.

Plastic pollution is pervasive around the Earth and is fundamentally
linked to climate change, while microplastics are increasingly a real
concern (Lavers et al., 2022; Tiernan et al., 2022). Several
international studies report recent findings of microplastics everywhere
in human bodies: the brain, lungs, digestive tissues, bone marrow,
penis, testis, seminal fluid (semen), and placenta - causing serious
health and reproductive concerns (Codrington et al., 2024; M. A. Garcia
et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2024; Hu et al., 2024; N. Li et al., 2024;
Main, 2024; Montano et al., 2023; L. Zhu et al., 2024)

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-19-output-1.pdf}}

In addition to the enormity of over-reaching CO\textsubscript{2}
emissions, humanity is facing other massive environmental problems. The
Stockholm Resilience Centre report in 2022 we have already breached 4
out of our 9 \emph{``planetary boundaries'':} in addition to climate
change, biodiversity loss (Extinctions per Million Species per Year aka
E/MSY), land-system change (deforestation, land degradation, etc), and
biogeochemical flows (cycles of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, etc); on a
positive side, the challenges of fresh water use, ocean acidification
and stratospheric ozone depletion are still within planetary limits
(Persson et al., 2022).

An update to the planetary boundaries framework a year later found the
actual number to be 6 of 9 boundaries (climate, biosphere integrity,
land use, biogeochemical flows, freshwater use, novel entities) already
transgressed, with ocean acidification nearing its limit and only
stratospheric ozone recovering; atmospheric aerosol loading and the
biodiversity intactness index (BII), which belongs under biodiversity
loss and measures how depleted are the species that are still around
(but not yet extinct), were quantified recently (Newbold et al., 2016;
Richardson et al., 2023).

In the biospehere, mass extinctions are underway. An analysis of
population trends for 27600 terrestrial vertebrate species (including a
detailed sample of 177 mammals), found 32\% (8851 species) are
undergoing severe range contractions; the authors name this ``biological
annihilation'' to signal Earth's ongoing 6 mass extinction and call for
immediate conservation action (Ceballos et al., 2017). As of last year,
the Red List curated by the International Union for Conservation of
Nature (IUCN), includes 45,300 species (28\% of all assessed, since IUCN
was founded in 1948), under threat of extinction (IUCN, 2024).

In 2018 Swedish Sportswear brand Houdini launched the first corporate
planetary boundaries assessment in partnership with Albaeco and
Stockholm Resilience Centre to establish a baseline for its ``impact
positive'' ambition (Houdini, 2018). While it's a pilot study, it
demonstrates how companies can integrate system-level science into
sustainability reporting (Haeggman et al., 2018). At the 2024 update for
the report, Houdini invited, Johan Rockström, a renown conservation and
climate scientist, envisions a global dashboard of the development of
the economy and the state of the planetary boundaries, with high
resolution maps, to help visualize Earth's situation in real-time
(Houdini Sportswear, 2024).

\subsubsection{Evolving Measurements from Planetary Health to Earth
System Law, and Social Cost of
Carbon}\label{evolving-measurements-from-planetary-health-to-earth-system-law-and-social-cost-of-carbon}

Scientists in cross-disciplinary teams have been working on integrating
Earth systems and human society into cohesive frameworks. (Wardani et
al., 2023) stresses that every facet of Earth's life-support
system---living biota and the ``abiotic'' foundations of climate, water,
soils, and geology---co-produces the conditions for civilisation:
\emph{``long-term human well-being is dependent on the well-being of the
planet, including both biotic and abiotic systems. It recognizes
interlinkages across environmental sustainability, public health, and
socioeconomic development.''}

There are 3 approaches that address the complex interdependence of
humans with our physical environment, that have the potential to be
complementary - \emph{Planetary Health}, \emph{Social Cost of Carbon},
and \emph{Earth System Law}.

\emph{Planetary Health} is a framework rooted in public health sciences
and medicine; what if public health levelled-up to planetary scale,
concerned with the health of ecological life-support systems: clean air,
food, and a safe climate, so they can support human flourishing; in
practice the framework focuses on evidence, education, governance, and
business (Planetary Health Alliance, 2024a, 2024b).

\emph{Social Cost of Carbon} attempts to measures the compound impact of
CO\textsubscript{2e} emissions on society. Sustainability is filled with
complexities. CO\textsubscript{2e} emissions are complicated by
biodiversity loss, child labor, slavery, poverty, chemical pollution,
etc. - many issues become intertwined (TEDx Talks, 2020). One attempt to
measure these complexities, is the \emph{Social Cost of Carbon} (SCC)
which is defined as \emph{``additional damage caused by an extra unit of
emissions''} (Kornek et al., 2021; Zhen et al., 2018). For example the
cost of damages caused by ``one extra ton of carbon dioxide emissions''
(Stanford University, 2021). SCC variations exist between countries
(Tol, 2019) and regions (Yong Wang et al., 2022).

\emph{Earth System Law} is a framework rooted in the legal sciences for
addressing interconnected environmental challenges in a hyper-connected
Earth, where climate feedbacks and environmental thresholds don't
respect country borders; in practice, this line of thinking helps to
develop carbon-budget clauses inside trade deals and biodiversity
``safety brakes'' that trigger when monitoring data shows an Earth
boundary overshoot, potentially acting as the legal scaffolding that
lets Planetary Health prescriptions and Social Cost of Carbon price
signals be effective (Du Toit \& Kotzé, 2022).

More recently, (Lenton et al., 2023) proposed a new innovative way to
quantify the ``cost'' of global warming in human terms by counting the
number of people forced outside the ``human climate niche''
(temperatures historically occupied by most of humanity); climate change
has already exposed ≈9\% of today's population (\textgreater600 million)
unprecedented heat stress, risking increased mortality, morbidity and
displacement; if current trends continue by 2100, \textasciitilde2.7 °C
, 21--39 \% or 2--4 billion people will be exposed by 2080--2100.

\subsection{Ecosystem Services: Quantifying Human Benefits from
Nature}\label{ecosystem-services-quantifying-human-benefits-from-nature}

\emph{Ecosystem services measure the benefits humans receive from the
biosphere.} Put most simply, \emph{ecosystem services} enable human life
on Earth. While it can be assumed much of the flora and fauna are
crucial for Earth's systems, science is still in the process of
understanding and quantifying its contributions. The history of the
valuation of nature's services goes back to the 18th century when David
Ricardo and Jean Baptiste Say discussed nature's \emph{work}, however
both considered it should be free (Gómez-Baggethun et al., 2010). In
1997 (Daily, 1997) proposed the idea of \emph{ecosystem services} and
(Costanza et al., 1997) attempted to assess the amount of ecosystem
services provided. (Le Provost et al., 2022)'s study shows
\emph{biodiversity} as one key factor to maintain delivery of ecosystem
services. (Noriega et al., 2018) attempts to quantify the ecosystem
services (ES) provided by insects.

The most complex computer models which attempt to capture ever more
interactions happening in the physical realm are called \emph{digital
twins.} The EU is developing a digital twin of Earth to help
sustainability prediction and planning, integrating Earth's various
systems such as climate, hydrology, ecology, etc, into a single model
\emph{Destination {Earth} {\textbar} {Shaping Europe}'s Digital Future}
(2023). We can use all the data being recorded to provide a digital twin
of the planet, nature, ecosystems and human actions to help us change
our behavior and optimize for planetary wellbeing.

\subsubsection{The Biosphere: Earth's Life Support
System}\label{the-biosphere-earths-life-support-system}

Earth's biosphere is made up of 846 terrestrial ecoregions, which are
distributed across 14 major biomes and 8 biogeographical realms
(Dinerstein et al., 2017).

\subsubsection{Using Ecological Indicators to Track Environmental
Health}\label{using-ecological-indicators-to-track-environmental-health}

Sustainability can be measured using a variety of \emph{ecological
indicators}.

Ecological indicators for Earth \emph{- I would like to coin the word
``ecomarkers'' -} are like \emph{biomarkers} in human health.

Technological advances help scientist better understand nature. Cutting
edge research uses AI-based voice recognition for listening to nature,
assessing biodiversity based on species' sounds in the forest. Millions
of detections of different species with machine learning passive
acoustic AI models, can also assess species' response to climate change
(AI for Good, 2023; Guerrero et al., 2023).

\emph{Environmental DNA (eDNA)} helps scientists measure species
abundance without direct observation through detection of DNA on genetic
materials such as skin cells (Peter Andrey Smitharchive page, 2024).
Cellular DNA can be isolated from various sediment types (Ogram et al.,
1987). Beyond scientific applications, eDNa is being used to generate
biodiversity credits by environmental asset rating companies such as
BeZero, a ratings agency for the Voluntary Carbon Market (Ojoatre \&
Atkinson, 2023).

AI is being used to map icebergs and measure the change in size
(European Space Agency, 2023).

\subsubsection{Measuring Biodiversity Loss and Environmental
Degradation}\label{measuring-biodiversity-loss-and-environmental-degradation}

Pressure on ecosystems is rapidly increasing, with biodiversity
destruction ever prevalent, making protecting biodiversity as urgent as
protecting the climate. (Almond, R.E.A. et al., 2022) reported, the
number of species killed, mass destruction of nature. ``69\% decline in
the relative abundance of monitored wildlife populations around the
world between 1970 and 2018. Latin America shows the greatest regional
decline in average population abundance (94\%), while freshwater species
populations have seen the greatest overall global decline (83\%).''

Similarly to climate protection, the UN has taken a leadership role in
biodiversity protection, by organizing an annual Convention on
Biodiversity. The history of the United Nations Convention on
Biodiversity goes back to 1988, when the working group was founded
(Unit, 2023). The Convention on Biodiversity 2022 (COP15) adopted the
first global biodiversity framework to accompany climate goals (UNEP,
Tue, 12/20/2022 - 07:44).

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-20-output-1.pdf}}

Biodiversity loss is linked to overconsumption, weak legislation and
lack of oversight. (Crenna et al., 2019) recounts European Union
consumers' negative impact on biodiversity in countries where it imports
food. (WWF, 2022) case study highlights how 4 biodiverse regions Cerrado
in Brazil, Chaco in Argentina, Sumatra in Indonesia, and the Cuvette
Centrale in Democratic Republic of Congo are experiencing rapid
destruction due to consumer demand in the European Union. While the
European Union (EU) has recently become a leader in sustainability
legislation, biodiversity protection measures among private companies is
very low Marco-Fondevila \& Álvarez-Etxeberría (2023).

Starting with the simple question: why protect biodiversity. (May, 2011)
argues biodiversity loss is a concern for 3 points of views:

\end{longtable}

There is some progress in biodiversity conservation as
``{[}*b{]}iodiversity awareness is now at 72\% or higher in all
countries sampled, compared to only 29\% or higher across countries
sampled in 2009''* (UEBT, 2022)

\subsubsection{Oceans and Marine Ecosystem
Sustainability}\label{oceans-and-marine-ecosystem-sustainability}

Marine heatwaves are intensifying under climate change, threatening
species diversity and the ocean's capacity to supply critical services
from fisheries to carbon sequestration (Smale et al., 2019).
Accelerating ocean warming, evidenced by record-breaking sea-surface
temperatures, has triggered widespread coral bleaching, cleary visible
at the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland, East Coast of Australia, loss
of marine habitat complexity, and cascading threats to coastal economies
and food security; the authors call for integrated climate--ocean policy
action, stressing that without urgent emissions cuts and ecosystem-based
adaptation, the ocean's capacity to regulate climate and sustain
biodiversity will collapse (Gelles \& Andreoni, 2023; Pfeiffer, 2024).
Cumulative pressures: climate extremes, pollution, and overexploitation
--- have driven evolutionary shifts in marine life and unpredictably
altered ecosystem-service delivery (Espinosa \& Bazairi, 2023).

Some earlier studies, such as (Howard et al., 2017) demonstrate how
integrating blue carbon habitats into Marine Protected Area (MPA) design
can both mitigate carbon emissions and enhance ecosystem resilience.
Meta-analyses across 121 sites in 87 MPAs globally show that most
well-designed and managed MPAs achieve significant ecological gains: on
average, fish biomass inside no-take zones can double to triple compared
with outside areas, and species richness likewise increases by 20--30 \%
within 5--10 years of enforcement (Rudd, 2015). However, Marine
Protected Areas cover only 8\% of the world's oceans and only 2.8\% is
effectively protected (Igini, 2024a). The UN's 30x30 target (set under
the Convention on Biological Diversity) aims to protect 30\% of the
world's oceans by 2030, however is not on track to achieve this goal
(Mouterde, 2024).

\subsubsection{Forests: Carbon Sinks and Biodiversity
Reservoirs}\label{forests-carbon-sinks-and-biodiversity-reservoirs}

Forests are a crucial part of Earth's carbon cycle and the main natural
CO\textsubscript{2} capture system; due to deforestation, Europe rapidly
losing its forest carbon sink (Frédéric Simon, 2022). Beyond their role
in locking away carbon, recent field work shows forest actively scrub
methane from the air as tree bark absorbs methane (Gauci et al., 2024).
Around 27\% of Earth's land area is still covered by forests yet
\emph{deforestation} is widespread all around the world; highest rates
of deforestation happened in the tropical rainforests of South America
and Africa, mainly caused by agricultural cropland expansion (50\% of
all deforestation) and grazing land for farm animals to produce meat
(38,5\%), totaling close to 90\% of global deforestation (\emph{{FRA}
2020 {Remote Sensing Survey}}, 2022). The global forest cover change is
visible on Google's Earth Engine (Hansen et al., 2013).

Around the world, there are many initiatives to increase forest cover,
for example the \emph{1 billion tree project} (Bastin et al., 2019;
{``Erratum for the {Report},''} 2020; Greenfield \& @pgreenfielduk,
2021). However, it's important to not planting trees
(\emph{afforestation)} is not the full solution, as \emph{afforestation}
is different from \emph{reforestation}, which takes into account
biodiversity. Also, while using remote-sensing and machine-learning to
assess reforestation potential (see Klosterman et al., 2022), it doesn't
take into account local political realities, and socioeconomic issues
such as education, poverty and access to green jobs. Taking these aspect
into account may be beneficial, for example (Bousfield et al., 2022)
reports there's evidence paying landowners for the ecosystem services
their forests provide may reduce deforestation.

\subsubsection{Pollution: Air, Water, and Soil
Degradation}\label{pollution-air-water-and-soil-degradation}

In, Taiwan this is the ranking of pollution reports by citizens
(Ministry of Digital Affairs, 2024b):

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-22-output-2.pdf}}

Health and sustainability are inextricably linked. ``Human health is
central to all sustainability efforts.'', \emph{``All of these (food,
housing, power, and health care), and the~stress~that the lack of them
generate, play a huge role in our health''} (Sarah Ludwig Rausch \& Neha
Pathak, 2021).

\textbf{Air Pollution}

Clean air is a proposed as a \emph{human right} (Baroness Jones of
Moulsecoomb \& Caroline Lucas, 2023) yet air pollution is widespread
around the planet, with 99\% of Earth's human population being affected
by bad air quality that does not meet WHO air quality guidelines,
leading to health problems linked to 6.7 million \emph{premature deaths}
every year (World Health Organization, 2022).

Air pollution is linked to cancer incidence. In Taiwan, South Korea, and
England, groundbreaking research by (Lim et al., 2022) analyzed over
400000 individuals establishes exposure to 2.5μm PM (PM2.5) air
pollution as a \emph{cause for lung cancer.} In (Hannah Devlin, 2022),
professor Tony Mok, of the Chinese University of Hong Kong explains it
plainly, which I want to quote here in verbatim:

\begin{quote}
\emph{``We have known about the link between pollution and lung cancer
for a long time, and we now have a possible explanation for it. As
consumption of fossil fuels goes hand in hand with pollution and carbon
emissions, we have a strong mandate for tackling these issues -- for
both environmental and health reasons.''}
\end{quote}

The main way to combat air pollution is through policy interventions.
(MARIA LUÍS FERNANDES, 2023) the EU has legislation in progress to curb
industrial emissions. If legislation is in place, causing bad air
quality can become bad for business. In China, (Gu et al., 2023) links
air pollution to credit interest rates for business loans; companies
with low environmental awareness and a history of environmental
penalties pay 12 percent higher interest rates. In France, (Bouscasse et
al., 2022) finds strong health and economic benefits across the board
from air pollution reduction.

\textbf{Water and Soil Pollution}

Lack of access to sufficient clean water and water pollution are issues
in several places around the world. Globally, 4.4 billion people only
have access to water that's not safe for drinking (Soliman, 2024).

Even in wealthy countries like the the US, with increasing situations of
water scarcity and drought due to climate change, issues of water
ownership become increasingly dire. (Koch, 2022; Naishadham, 2023b)
describes a fight in the US over water usage rights in Arizona, where
Fondomonte, a subsidiary of a Saudi Arabian company that grows a
water-hungry crop alfalfa, exacerbating the local water crisis by using
large amounts of public water, leading to public outcry and being sued
for ``public nuisance'' for its excessive groundwater pumping, and
finally cessation of its lease and operations on state land; but still
continuing operations on private land (Naishadham, 2023a; {``Saudi Firm
That Grows Hay in {California} and {Arizona} to Lose Farm Leases over
Water Issue,''} 2023).

Water quality is highly dependent on competent governance. For example,
in the U.S., the national government recently rolled back rules for
water safety, which had been implemented last year, to protect the
consumer from per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) (Trager, 2025).

Once pollution is in the environment, cleaning it up is very expensive.
For instance, in France, where storm water washed pollution into the
waterways feeding into the Seine river, making it unsuitable for
swimming, the city of Paris invested 1.4 Billion Euros to create a
massive underground reservoir and a water cleaning system by the opening
of the Paris Olympics in 2024 - and still the water quality would be
variable based on rain incidence (Walt, 2023).

Water and soil pollution are highly connected, as water flows through
soil. In Saudi Arabia, (Picó et al., 2023) used wild and ruderal plants
as bioindicators to detect pollution of air, water and soil,specifically
anthropogenic pollution, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and other
industrial chemicals, concluding both Abha and Riyadh showed notable
levels of pollutants while Riyadh (a city with more industry) showed
higher levels of pollution.

A practical example of the interconnection between water pollution,
agriculture, architecture, and extreme weather, are bioswales, which
help catch storm debris and reduce water pollution.

\subsubsection{Climate and Disaster Preparedness: Building Resilience to
Extreme
Weather}\label{climate-and-disaster-preparedness-building-resilience-to-extreme-weather}

The Word Economic Forums Global Risks Report 2024 paints a bleak picture
of the future with expectations of increased turbulence across the board
based on a survey of over 1400 topic experts (World Economic Forum,
n.d.). Global warming specifically increases the risk of disasters and
extreme weather events; the US Global Change Research Program presented
a comprehensive report to the US Congress, which links disaster-risk
directly to global warming; for examples increased wildfires damage
property, endanger life and reduces \emph{air quality,} which in effect
increases health challenges (\emph{Fifth {National Climate Assessment}},
2023). Warming global climate has concrete effects on daily life. Warmer
climate helps viruses and fungi spread (Press, 2023). (Williams \&
Joshi, 2013) higher CO2 concentrations in the air can cause more
turbulence for flights. As extreme temperatures are increasingly
commonplace, with observed changes in heatwaves, there's increased risk
of wildfires (Perkins-Kirkpatrick \& Green, 2023; Volkova et al., 2021),
while flood risk mapping might lower property prices in at risk areas
(Sherren, 2024). Summers of 2022 and 2023 were the hottest on record so
far, with extreme heat waves recorded in places around the world
(Douglas, 2023; Falconer, 2023; National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA), U.S. Department of Commerce, 2023; NOAA National
Centers for Environmental Information, 2023; Serrano-Notivoli et al.,
2023; Venturelli et al., 2023).

The part of Earth where the \emph{human climate niche} is becoming
smaller (McKibben, 2023). As temperatures rise, certain cities may
become uninhabitable for humans (CBC Radio, 2021). The summer of 2023
saw extensive wildfires in Spain, Canada, and elsewhere; rapidly moving
fires destroyed the whole city of Lāhainā in Hawaii {[}ADD CITATION{]}.
In California, (Jerrett et al., 2022) says, \emph{``{[}w{]}ildfires are
the second most important source of emissions in 2020''} and
\emph{``negate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from other
sectors.''} Some parts of South America have seen summer heat \emph{in
the winter}, with heatwaves with temperatures as high as 38 degrees
(Livingston, 2023).

In Taiwan disaster risk and hazard mapping is well-developed, with early
warning systems, and comprehensive response preparedness - and painful
experiences - instrumental to saving lives (Y.-J. Tsai et al., 2021).
Intensifying storms forming near coastlines, can be expected with
\emph{``{[}c{]}hanges to tropical cyclone trajectories in Southeast Asia
under a warming climate''} (Garner et al., 2024). The situation on the
Pacific and Atlantic oceans is not dissimilar, with
\emph{``{[}o{]}bserved increases in North Atlantic tropical cyclone peak
intensification rates''} (Garner, 2023).

In the Phillipines, with increasing extreme weather events,
\emph{``businesses are more likely to emerge in areas where
infrastructure is resilient to climate hazards''} (Y. Cheng \& Han,
2022).

Climate-related disasters can spur action as extreme weather becomes
visible to everyone. After large floods in South Korea in July 2023 with
many victims, president Joon promised to begin taking global warming
seriously and steer the country towards climate action (AFP, 2023; Al
Jazeera, 2023; Web, 2023). South Korea has a partnership with the
European Union (European Commission, 2023a).

\subsection{Financialization of Nature vs Nature's Sacred Value: How to
Scale Up Sustainable
Action}\label{financialization-of-nature-vs-natures-sacred-value-how-to-scale-up-sustainable-action}

There are 2 main approaches to protecting nature:

Measure and assign monetary value to nature. & Nature is Sacred - such
as are religious holy places - and can't be touched (Eisenstein, 2011,
2018) \\
\end{longtable}

The question of whether we should we put a price on nature (or is it
time to leave utilitarian environmentalism behind?) is still openly
debated, with pro-financialization voices arguing assigning monetary
figures to nature's benefits legible to policymakers and markets,
channeling large sums into conservation (e.g.~carbon/biodiversity
credits), while critics argue monetary metrics flatten relational,
cultural and intrinsic values of ecosystems into exchange-value and
commoditize nature, which may legitimize offsetting schemes that
displace rather than prevent damage (Leverhulme Centre for Nature
Recovery, 2023).

Ecosystem services literature defines a ``Nature's Contributions to
People'' framework, originally proposed by the Intergovernmental
Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).
(Díaz et al., 2018). (Muradian \& Gómez-Baggethun, 2021) critically
assess the framework, arguing utilitarian and anthropocentric views of
the ecosystem services concept perpetuates problematic dualisms (humans
and nature are separate) - and call for a new approach centered on
ecology.

\end{longtable}

A practical example of ecosystem services becoming a common language
comes from (Z. Zhang et al., 2023) who proposes integrating ecosystem
services conservation into urban planning, so biodiversity could become
part of city planning. Another example is tourism, a large industrial
sector which relies on ecosystem services (L. Li et al., 2023). In
Taiwan, (T. H. Lee et al., 2021) developed a framework of indicators to
assess sustainable tourism.

\subsubsection{Ecological Restoration: Healing Damaged Ecosystems
Through Agroforestry \&
Permaculture}\label{ecological-restoration-healing-damaged-ecosystems-through-agroforestry-permaculture}

The concept of how a public resource is over-used until breaking down as
each user only bears a fraction of the cost - know as \emph{tragedy of
the commons} - was described by the ecologist Garrett Hardin in 1968
(Hardin, 1968; Lopez et al., 2022; Meisinger, 2022; Murase \& Baek,
2018). When so many systems are broken, some argue sustainability is not
enough and we should work on \emph{regeneration} of natural habitat. The
UN announced 2021-2030 the Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, which
includes a wide range of regenerative action (Fischer et al., 2021). For
instance, (Han \& Chen, 2022) identifies nature-based solutions ``land
re-naturalization (such as afforestation and wetland restoration)''

The organic food and drink market is growing worldwide, with gross sales
in 2019 totalling over 106 billion euros, albeid being a small
percentage of total food industry (Gamage et al., 2023). Growing organic
food poses many challenges, which farmers need to adapt to, in order to
participate in regenerative food systems. One approach is growing food
forests, also known as agroforestry, which integrates farming into
natural environments, achieving CO2 storage in the soil through
agriculture and forestry using agroecological practices.

In Ireland, (Irwin et al., 2023) studied dairy farmers' willingness to
plant trees to increase vegetation cover on their land, finding that
economic incentives alone are insufficient, and support in the form of
advisory and education is needed. Similarly, in the Brazilian Amazon
rainforest (Yadav et al., 2023) finds the active participation of the
local community in planning permaculture practices, enhances their
acceptance and effectiveness. In Bangladesh, (Ruba \& Talucder, 2023)
found agroforestry plays an active role in achieving the country's
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including zero hunger, climate
action, mitigating climate change impacts through CO2 sequestration,
life on land through biodiversity conservation and improving soil
fertility, yet is hindered by the lack of policy support and educational
level of the farmers. In the Baltic Sea region in North-Eastern Europe
and Central Europe face similar challenges, (Baltic Sea Action Group,
2023) pointing out farmers' traditional mindset as the biggest obstacle,
describing the paradigm shift from extractive farming to regenerative
agriculture, using techniques such as no-till farming, which reduces
soil erosion and improve soil health by reducing synhetic imputs; yet,
it's not only a single practice that is enough, regenerative agriculture
is a holistic approach and agroecology education programmes need to be
comprehehnsive.

(G. Low et al., 2023) futher studies how agroforestry deep integration
into food value chains unlocks opportunties for recognition and rewards
from economic actors in the network, underlining how complex and
knowledge-heavy nature of value-capture, calling for further
standardisation of practices to reward sustainability practices and
ecosystem services. The challenge lies in that bioeconomy is not
inherently sustainable and may put biodiversity at risk, depending on
the level of industrialisation of agriculture and specific practices,
which require deep knowledge and understanding of natural and artifical
interactions the ecological systems; the authors advocate for a precise
distinction between extractive and regenerative practices in
``bioeconomy'' (Ollinaho \& Kröger, 2023). Finally, taking Brazil as and
example, (De Queiroz-Stein \& Siegel, 2023) argues for an integration of
competing and comflicting bioeconomy policies, in order to achieve the
goals of a sustainable bioeconomy.

Svalbard Seed Vault is an example of seed conservation to safeguard
biodiversity by storing backup seeds of plants from around the world in
cold storage (Asdal \& Guarino, 2018; Westengen et al., 2013). Since its
opening in 2008, the storage solution provided by the Norwegian
government has stored seeds from from 123 genebanks in 85 countries
around the world ({``Arctic Doomsday Seed Vault Gets More Than 14,000
New Samples,''} 2025; The Norwegian Ministry of Agriculture and Food,
2025). (Vitaletti, 2025) proposes using a blockchain-based lottery
system to storage seeds in local refridgerators, in order to enhance
resliance and ensure survivial of seeds, by storing seeds in many
locations.

\subsection{Energy Production: ``Climatech'', Renewable Energy and
Decarbonisation
Pathways}\label{energy-production-climatech-renewable-energy-and-decarbonisation-pathways}

Globally, 34\% of all emissions come from energy production (US EPA,
2016), making it the key sector to require innovate for reducing carbon
emissions. The International Energy Agency's (IEAs), ``Tracking Clean
Energy Progress'' report on 50 distinct decarbonisation enablers and
finds that only 3 components - solar PV, PV electric vehicles, and
building lighting - are on track with the net zero by 2050 scenario,
while 28 need more effort and 22 are ``not on track'' (IEA, 2023b).

Geopolitical situations can affect technology adoption; after Russia's
war in Ukraine, Europe needed to quickly reduce consuming cheap Russian
fossil fuel energy (in the form of gas) (Bonasia, 2024). In 2024, for
first time in Europe, renewables in the form of wind and solar energy
surged past production of fossil fuels (Beer, 2024; Graham \& Fulghum,
2024).

(Gaure \& Golombek, 2022) simulate a CO\textsubscript{2} free
electricity generation system in the European Union where ``98\% of
total electricity production is generated by wind power and solar; the
remainder is covered by a backup technology.''. The authors stipulate
it's possible to power the EU without producing CO\textsubscript{2}
emissions.

EU's energy mix in 2024:

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-23-output-1.pdf}}

Wind and solar energy overtook fossil energy in Europe:

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-24-output-1.pdf}}

Globally, renewables also overtook fossil fuels (IEA, 2024):

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-25-output-1.pdf}}

Meanwhile, reduction in coal-power was also possible. Coal is a large
CO2 emitter.

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-27-output-1.pdf}}

Large technology conglomerates and newly founded startups alike are
working in the climate solutions space (often referred to as
\emph{climatech} by the media), have proposed a range of approaches to
CO\textsubscript{2} reduction in the Earth's atmosphere. These
technologies include several types of \emph{carbon capture}, directly
from the air (direct air capture or DAC), from the source of pollution,
such as using high--performance filters on factory chimneys, as well as
nature-based solutions such as large scale tree planting using drones.
Each technology has their own pros and cons. For instance,(Vitillo et
al., 2022) illustrates how direct air capture of CO\textsubscript{2} is
difficult because of low concentration and CO\textsubscript{2} capture
at the source of the emissions is more feasible. Overall, considering
pathways to carbon drawdown finds considerable uncertainty exists among
experts which CO2 reduction among nature- and technology-based methods
are the most effective (S. Low et al., 2022).

\subsubsection{Individual Action}\label{individual-action}

Sometimes individual environmental (climate) action \emph{does matter}
and can come at great personal cost, even loss of life. EJAtlas tracks
environmental justice cases around the world, where human stakes are
very high Scheidel et al. (2020).

However, for most of us individual climate action is \emph{ineffective}.
The effect of individual climate action such as \emph{choosing a more
sustainable product} is so limited to be next to meaningless. For
individual consumer choices to make a difference, they need to be
\emph{aggregated} into a movement, collective action with scale,
influence, and visibility.

There is no single solution to the environmental crisis. Given the
enormity of environmental degradation, many different approaches are
needed. This chapter documents some of the ongoing work which a
sustainability companion could assist college students get involved
with.

While the scale of climate change is too big for individual action to
make a difference, individual action can foster hope and a sense of
collective responsibility (Nature, 2020).

\subsection{Eco-Design: Design as Political Action at
Scale}\label{eco-design-design-as-political-action-at-scale}

Politics matters in sustainability. In Brazil, deforestation fell 60\%
in 1 year, based on remote satellite reconnaissance, after the election
of a more pro-environment leadership (Watts, 2023).

We have an opportunity to re-imagine how every product can be an
eco-product and how they circulate in our circular economy.

The monumental task of removing several gigatons of CO\textsubscript{2e}
from the atmosphere requires massive policy shifts and collaboration
across countries and industries (Mackler et al., 2021).

Designing the right legislative measures can be hugely impactful. In the
context of the European Union, \emph{eco-design} has gained political
support from European Commission as part of the EU's \emph{``Green
Deal''} legislative strategy, aiming to transform European economies
into sustainability leaders (Commission et al., 2014). Consumer
products' overall life-cycle environmental impact is defined in the
design process by the materials and energy resources needed and the
post-consumer potential for reuse or recycling. The Ecodesign for
Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR) entered into force in July 2024
(European Commission, 2024) following the (European Parliament, 2022)
proposal whereby the European Commission established a general framework
for \emph{eco-design: ``requirements for sustainable products, repealing
rules {[}referring to the previous Eco-Design Directive (2009/125/EC){]}
currently in force which concentrate on energy-related products only,''}
setting up a level playing-field for the organizations operating on the
EU single market. Virginijus Sinkevičius, the EU Commissioner for the
Environment, Oceans and Fisheries, is quoted as describing eco-design as
design that \emph{``respects the boundaries of our planet''} (European
Commission, 2022c).

Europe has been of a path of transformation from 2023 to 2030.

\caption{EU Policy Context Timeline}

\end{figure}%

The EU Commission has been releasing strategic foresight reports since
2020 (European Commission, 2023b).

Timeline of the Policy Context:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In 2019 by the von der Leyen commission adopted the European Union
  (EU) Green Deal strategy.
\item
  In 2021 the Commision proposed a goal of reducing CO2e emissions by
  55\% by 2030 under the \emph{Fit for 55} policy package consisting of
  a wide range of economic measures.
\item
  In November 2022, the proposal was adopted by the EU Council and EU
  Parliament with an updated goal of 57\% of CO2e reductions compared to
  1990. This proposal is set to become a binding law for all EU member
  countries (European Commission (2019c); European Commission (2019a);
  \emph{{EU} Reaches Agreement on National Emission Reductions} (2022);
  European Council (2022)).
\item
  In March 2022, the EU Circular Economy Action Plan was adopted,
  looking to make sustainable products \emph{the norm} in EU and
  \emph{empowering consumers} as described in European Commission
  (2022a). Each product covered by the policy is required to have a
  \textbf{\emph{Digital Product Passport}} which enables improved
  processing within the supply chain and includes detailed information
  to empower consumers to understand the environmental footprint of
  their purchases. It's safe to say the large majority of products
  available today do not meet these criteria.
\item
  European Commission (2022b) Ecodesign for sustainable products. The EU
  ``Green Deal'' legislative strategy is comprehensive. Eco-Design is a
  Key EU Sustainable Policy Design Tool.
\end{itemize}

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-29-output-1.pdf}}

In the European Union (EU), a wide range of legislative proposals,
targets, organizations, and goals have exists across diverse countries.
It's not that the EU didn't have an overarching environmental policy
before; rather it was more vague and filled with loop-holes. Upcoming
laws aim to harmonize approaches to sustainability and raise standards
for all members states, in turn influencing producers who wish to sell
in the EU common market. National governments need to adapt EU
legislation to local contexts. For example Estonian government adopted
the Estonian Green Deal Action Plan (Eesti Rohepöörde Tegevusplaan)
(Eesti Vabariigi Valitsus, 2022). From the legislative perspective, NFRD
(Non-Financial Reporting Directive) is replaced by CSRD (Corporate
Sustainability Reporting Directive) and ESRS reporting is the standard
to meet CSRD requirements.

Director of the French environmental NGO Pôle Eco-conception, eco-design
is ``{[}l{]}ocated at the interface between consumption and production
patterns, eco-design helps to structure the market for products and
services using a life cycle approach and tangible criteria'' (Chouai \&
Mayer, 2024).

The EU is also concerned with supply-chain deforestation. Sustainable
Products and EUDR (European Union Deforestation Regulation) work
hand-in-hand as part of EU's legislative efforts to promote
sustainability. EUDR applies to all products placed on the market from
December 2024 and June 2025 for small businesses.

The proposal for a Nature Restoration Law by the European Commission
requiring member countries to restore 20\% of EU's degraded ecosystems
by 2030 and full restoration by 2050 has not yet passed (as of writing)
(\emph{Scientists Urge {European Parliament} to Vote for Nature
Restoration Law}, 2023) and is facing a backlash (David Pinto, 2023).

The EU has a \emph{taxonomy of environmentally sustainable economic
activities} published by the Technical Expert Group (TEG) on sustainable
finance, as detailed in the report by (\emph{{EU} Taxonomy for
Sustainable Activities}, n.d.).

Europe is transforming into a hotbed of sustainability. One of the EU
goals is reducing careless consumption. Tacking our consumption habits
can help support eco-designed products. It's up to legislators to
provide sustainable products on our marketplace\ldots{} but until this
happens, we can use the green filter.

\subsubsection{Legislative Efforts Around the
World}\label{legislative-efforts-around-the-world}

Europe is not the only region undertaking legislative efforts to promote
sustainability. In the US, the \emph{Inflation Reduction Act} provided
funding to development of de-carbonizing technologies and includes plans
to combat air pollution, reduce green house gases and address
environmental injustices (Rajagopalan \& Landrigan, 2023).

Many other jurisdictions also have laws that aim to reduce the
environmental impact of products throughout their life cycles.

For instance Australia has a Product Stewardship (PS) scheme, which also
includes an investment fund targeted at increasing the recycling rates
of specific products (Australian Government, 2024). Australia, Japan,
and Taiwan all have Sustainable Procurement schemes prioritizing greener
products in public purchases {[}ADD CITATION{]}.

\subsubsection{Eco-Modulation: Incentive Design for Extended Producer
Responsibility and Product
Stewardship}\label{eco-modulation-incentive-design-for-extended-producer-responsibility-and-product-stewardship}

Eco-modulation means harder to recycle items are more expensive for the
producer. Recycling fees take into account eco-design: an item from a
single material is easier (cheaper) to recycle than product from
composite materials.

Eco-modulation makes the hidden cost of hard-to-recycle formats directly
visible on the invoice.

While Taiwan doesn't yet have a specific eco-design law, there are
various pieces of legislation promoting circular economy {[}ADD
CITATION{]}. Already in 1988 Taiwan implemented an Extended Producer
Responsibility (EPR) scheme, followed by a recycling system (initially
focused on electronic items) in 1998 (Chong et al., 2009). Eco-design
initiatives in Taiwan started at least as early as 1994, when Taiwanese
companies and universities noticed international sustainability trends
and began to implement their own sustainable design initiatives (Jahau
Lewis Chen et al., 2005).

Deposit Return Schemes (DRS)

In California, part of the EPR regulation is a large pool of funding for
cleaning up historic pollution resulting from Moolman (2024)

The key to comparing Product Stewardship, Extended Producer
Responsibility (EPR), and Eco-Design is the scope, as illustrated in the
chart below. While Product Stewardship (PS) and Extended Producer
Responsibility (EPR) deal mostly with the end of the product life-cycle
(they are \emph{reactive}), including their disposal and recycling (EPR
going a step further than PS by shifting the responsibility to the
producer), eco-design moves sustainability up the design chain (lbeing
\emph{pro-active}), setting standards for making better products - in
essence, attempting to \emph{design-out} the waste.

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-30-output-1.pdf}}

Extended Producer Responsibility Enables Companies to be Resposible.

Popular blogs such as (Kohli, 2019) and (Lose, 2023) offer many
suggestions how designers can help people become more sustainable in
their daily lives yet focusing on the end-user neglects the producers'
responsibility (termed as Extended Producer Responsibility or ERP) in
waste management studies.

Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is a policy tool first proposed
by Thomas Lindhqvist in Sweden in 1990 {[}ADD CITATION{]}, aimed to
encourage producers take responsibility for the entire life-cycle of
their products, thus leading to more eco-friendly products. Nonetheless,
EPR schemes do not guarantee circularity and may instead be designed
around fees to finance waste management in linear economy models
(Christiansen et al., 2021). The French EPR scheme was upgraded in 2020
to become more circular (Jacques Vernier, 2021). In July 2024, Latvia
was the 4th EU country to join an textile-EPR scheme ({``New {EPR}
Requirements for Textiles in {Latvia} from {July} 2024 On,''} 2024).

In any case, strong consumer legislation (such as EPR) has a direct
influence on producers' actions. For example, in HKTDC Research (2022),
the Hong Kong Trade Development Council notified textile producers in
July 2022 reminding factories to produce to French standards in order to
be able enter the EU market. J. Peng et al. (2023) finds that the
\emph{Carbon Disclosure Project} has been a crucial tool to empower ERP
in Chinese auto-producers.

  while in France textiles are covered by an Extended Producer
  Responsibility (EPR) scheme leading to higher recovery rates (Ibid).

Packaging is a rapidly growing industry, expanding on the back of online
shopping, which generates large amounts of waste materials, which if not
reused or recycled, easily becomes garbage. Over 161M tonnes of plastic
packaging is produced every year (Bradley \& Corsini, 2023). Already
more than a decade ago, ({``Detail-Rich Sustainable Packaging {Product
Database} Is an Industry First,''} 2010)~proposed a database of green
packaging to compare hundreds of sustainable packaging materials and
guide designers through environmental, performance, and cost trade-offs
in one unified tool, in order to help producers choose better packaging
- yet the problem is far from solved. More recently, (Bradley \&
Corsini, 2023) developed an analytical framework of key sustainability
factors, from an overview of 107 studies on reusable packaging, finding
customer acceptance, high return rates, supply-chain shortening, and
system standardisation, as the key factors critical to unlocking
reusable packaging solutions at scale. A survey by PMMI, the Association
for Packaging and Processing Technologies, among industry professional,
found legacy equipment, higher material costs, and supply consistency as
the top barriers to sustainable packaging; in turn, vital enablers were
clear vendor guidance, proven material and quipment solutions, and
customer demand ({``Challenges and {Opportunities} in {Sustainable
Packaging Today},''} 2022). In response to legacy equipment issues,
({``Sulapac -- {Replacing} Plastic,''} n.d.) a large producer of
packaging, has proposed a wood-based, microplastic-free composites to
serve as drop-in replacements for plastics; a material even compatible
with existing molding, extrusion, and thermoforming production lines,
while slashing cradle-to-gate CO₂ emissions and preventing microplastic
pollution.

In food packaging specifically, (Ada et al., 2023) identified distinct
challenges from consumer acceptance to material-supply mismatches,
collection logistics, and regulatory gaps, underscoring the multifaceted
barriers to circular food packaging. Over 85\% of companies in the
``protein industry'': meat, poultry, seafood, and alternative proteins
have some type of sustainability inititive ({``Protein {Brands} and
{Consumers Alike Focus} on {Sustainability},''} 2022). Yet, having
sustainability programs does not make a company sustainable, case in
point being Coca Cola in the beverage industry. (Lerner, 2019) describes
Coca Cola's plastic pollution problem, based on leaked audio, how
Coca-Cola was exposed for lobbying against container-deposit laws,
aiming to misrepresented recycling as a complete solution; strategies
that stalled effective legislation and maintained a ``green'' façade
despite obstructing real sustainability progress.

ESG ratings have faced criticism for lack of standards and failing to
account for the comprehensive impact a company is having. (Foley et al.,
2024) notes how Coca Cola fails to account the supply chain water usage
when reporting becoming ``water neutral'' and calls on companies to
release more detailed information; major ESG ratings omit 90\% of the
company's water footprint.

\subsubsection{Scenario-Building: Avoiding the Worst
Future}\label{scenario-building-avoiding-the-worst-future}

Scenario-building is a key tool for sustainability. Because
sustainability is so complex, sustainable design cannot always predict
certain outcomes but rather can use scenarios to prepare for several
possibilities. In sustainability there are rarely good choices. Rather
it's a question of avoiding the worst choices. \emph{Life Cycle
Assessment} and \emph{Environmental Impact Analysis} are needed to
provide eco-design scenarios (de Otazu et al., 2022).

Across several case studies, (Fabris \& Luburić, 2022) discusses
vulnerable sectors from agriculture to transport, under threat from
extreme weather events, such as floods, heatwaves, droughts, and storms
impact human health: societal development and economic growth should be
realistic on planning for weather-related impacts.

In the world of software production, user experience and iteration have
been the mainstay for a over a decade (Google Design, 2019)

\subsubsection{Design for Quality of
Life}\label{design-for-quality-of-life}

While traditional economic thinking is based on a conflict between
nature and development, some new models find there is potential for
synergy between economic, social, political, cultural, and environmental
metrics. (Kaklauskas et al., 2023) models multi-criteria analysis of 169
countries and 238 cities, finding 71\% average correlation between
Climate Change and Country Success (C3S) and Quality of Life (C3QL)
indicators. In a similar vein, (Rieger et al., 2023) develops an
integrated science of wellbeing, linking humans' psychological,
biological, societal and environmental domains to guide research and
public policy, based on interactions between domain experts.

Wellbeing Economy Governments is an example of country-level
collaboration in sharing expertise on sustainable development, looking
to bring post growth strategies and policy frameworks to the mainstream.
The concept of a wellbeing economy focuses on human and ecological
wellbeing rather than material growth since 2018 and includes Finland,
Iceland, New Zealand, Scotland, Wales, and Canada as founding members of
the network (Fioramonti et al., 2022).

For example, there's ample evidence from several countries suggesting
moving to renewal energy brings environmental benefits. In Bangladesh,
(Amin et al., 2022) suggests \emph{``removing fossil fuel subsidies and
intra-sectoral electricity price distortions coupled with carbon taxes
provides the highest benefits''} for both the economy and the
environment. In other words, green energy was a win-win solution, for
both the evironmental health and financial wealth.

I was torn whether to place \emph{politics} under \emph{sustainability}
or \emph{design}, and decided for the latter - as sustainability is
mostly \emph{descriptive}, using science to measure and present the real
situation, while design is \emph{prescriptive}: codifying decisions
about how do we live - in products and services. Design \emph{is}
political.

\textbf{Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)}

(Popkova et al., 2022) argues that SDGs need to discussed in their
totality and uses factor analysis to link SDGs to institutions and
digital technologies; findings include SDG 3 (Good Health and
Well-Being) and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) progress through
institutions in developed countries and are most impacted by digital
technologies and digital knowledge index, meanwhile SDG 16 (Peace,
Justice and Strong Institutions) makes the most headway in developing
countries, which are starting from a lower base. Likewise, the German
Institute of Development and Sustainability (IDOS) has built a tool to
connect SDGs and their 169 targets to NDCs (Nationally Determined
Contributions), looking for synergies for effective climate action plans
and sustainable development strategies, visualizing a clear skew which
SDGs receive the most climate‐related commitments - SDG 2 (Zero Hunger),
SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy);
meanwhile SDG 14 (Life Below Water), and the SDG 3 social goals
discussed above, SDG 4 (Quality Education) and SDG 5 (Gender Equality),
are the least adressed to climate plans (Dzebo et al., 2023).

\textbf{Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework}

Eco-Design is about improving processes and optimizing resources. While
the goal of reducing harm is shared, the specifics will depend on the
industry. (Van Doorsselaer, 2022) Defines ecodesign as ``design for X''
in a circular economy, thinking through the life cycle of a product,
tools, materials, production, use, and end-of-life phases.

In wine-making, (Manzardo et al., 2021) presents an Italian vinery case
study, where a redesigned Merlot red wine procedure reduced in
environmental impacts from fuel and pesticide use in vineyards; the
8-step procedure included calculating the product's environmental
footprint and following the ISO 14006 standard, titled
\emph{``Environmental management systems --- Guidelines for
incorporating ecodesign''}. Finding uses for by-products, can improve
sustainability even more. (Iñarra et al., 2022) designed a circular
scheme for brewery left-overs, producing feed ingredients for
aquaculture; in a further step, using life-cycle assessment (LCA) and
optimising logistics, reduced the aquafeed's environmental footprint
also by 6\%.

In architecture and the built environment, (\textbf{MUNARO202256?})
conducted a comprehensive reviews of ecodesign 288 articles, identifying
\emph{Design for Adaptability} and \emph{Disassembly} as the most
inclusive strategies, coining a new term DfAD; a framework linking DfAD
with lifecycle assessment tools is a promising are for research to
support sustainable construction.

In pharmaceuticals, (Bassani et al., 2022) proposes an approach to
eco-design using life-cycle assessment: optimizing packaging types,
alternative materials, transport, and weight reduction. A follow-up
study from the same group in 2023 extended the eco-design to a full
cradle-to-grave assessment and evaluated end-of-life alternatives
(Bassani et al., 2024).

In the printing industry, (Miyoshi et al., 2022) takes the example of
ink toner bottles and applies Life Cycle Simulation to show in a case
study how standardized compatibility between older and newer systems can
save resources and results in sustainability savings, highlighting how
remanufacturing is an important strategy in circularity for reducing CO₂
emissions and life cycle costs.

While these examples underline the industry-specifity of eco-design,
some authors attempt to come up with mores holistics approaches. For
instance (Ruiz-Pastor et al., 2022) developed ``CN\_Con'', a metric for
conceptual design, trying to measure circularity and novelty in
conjuction, by analysing product functions, durability, material
origins, and end-of-life, while at the same time supporting creative and
circular design solutions in early stages.

On an international level, looking at companies operating on the
European Single Market, (Arranz et al., 2022) conducted a large-scale
study using machine learning on firm survey data from 870 organisations
across diverse economic sectors, aqcuired from the 2015 EU Public
Consultation on the Circular Economy conducted by European Commission,
comparing coercive pressures (regulations, subsidies, grants), normative
pressures (industry standards, professional networks), and mimetic
pressures (competitive imitation), finding normative and mimetic
pressure only enhance sustainability, if coercive pressure already
exists - i.e.~regulations are a key point of leverage. In summary,
enacting laws which support sustainability can shift complex systems
with many parties towards a circular economy, and be enhanced by
additional voluntary forces. However, a comparative analysis of OECD
green growth indicators for the periods 2004--2005 and 2019 across EU
member states found that green transformation do not correlate directly
with development level - instead each country's unique socio-economic
context plays a role: governance quality and income distribution shape
the effectiveness of regulatory frameworks, suggesting that coercive
policies must be tailored to national circumstances in order to
reinforce circular-economy adoption at scale(Cheba et al., 2022).

\subsection{Thinking in Systems to Re-Design
Industries}\label{thinking-in-systems-to-re-design-industries}

Here I will use the lens of \emph{sustainability} - another complex term
- to look at how design can contribute to eco-friendly products. I
advocate looking at design methods as a toolbox, where I can pick the
tool suitable for the problem set in front of me. Here I look at a small
number of design practices I find relevant to designing a sustainability
app for college students that may improve on traditional design methods.
While AI allows us to look at a larger number of design scenarios thank
previously feasible, there are many approaches looking for ways to
design for sustainability. Designing for Sustainability is fundamentally
a hopeful act imbibed with the dream a healthier world is possible -
because health and sustainability are intrinsically connected.

\emph{Eco-Design}, \emph{Circular Design}, \emph{Design for Circularity,
Cradle-to-Cradle Design}, \emph{Green Design}, \emph{Regenerative
Design}, \emph{Climate-Responsive Design}, \emph{Life-Centered Design,
Design for Human Rights, Multispecies Design, Designing for Health} -
designing for sustainability has been called with many names in diverse
contexts of use, using a diversity of approaches, with subtle
differences of emphasis and nuance, with same general goal of being more
sustainable. While the European ESPR legislation chose \emph{Eco-Design}
as the overarching title, researchers and practitioners discuss all of
the above on a frequent basis. (Ceschin \& Gaziulusoy, 2016) gives a
comprehensive overview of the main themes of sustainable design and the
main contributions and limitations in the well--researched
\emph{``Evolution of design for sustainability: From product design to
design for system innovations and transitions''}.

In most cases, designing for sustainability makes use of \emph{systems
thinking}, underlining the importance of looking at the entire
life-cycle of a product or service. (Rossi et al., 2022) shows how
introducing sustainability early in the design process and providing
scenarios where sustainability is a metric, it's possible to achieve
more eco-friendly designs. Yet, calculating what's sustainable is hugely
complex because decisions may have unforeseen ramifications. To take a
single example (Nuez et al., 2022) shows how electric vehicles may
increase CO\textsubscript{2} emissions in some areas, such as Canary
Islands, where electricity production is polluting. In sum, sustainable
design encompasses all human activities, making this pursuit an
over-arching challenge across all industries and all human activities
with the complex interdependence contained within these interactions.

(Engkvist, 2024) calls for \emph{Design Sociology}, design should take
account the product's effect on society, giving the example of highly
individualized understanding of individualized psychology and dopamine
cycles for creating social media, while disregarding the societal
effects, such as spread of misinformation. Lack of sustainability in the
design process is a \emph{bug} in the design approach.

\emph{Service Design}, (Ceschin \& Gaziulusoy, 2016) shows how design
for sustainability has expanded from a product focus to systems-thinking
focus placing the product inside a societal context of use. For example
(\emph{Cargo Bike {\textbar} {FREITAG}}, n.d.), recycled clothing maker
FREITAG offers sustainability-focused services such as cargo bikes so
you can transport your purchases and a network for \emph{shopping
without payment} = swapping your items with other members, as well as
repairs of their products. Loaning terminology from \emph{service
design}, the user journey within an app needs to consider each
touchpoint on the way to a state of success.

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-31-output-1.pdf}}

As this research is \emph{practice-oriented} (i.e., my goal here is to
find design approaches that could influence my prototype), I will focus
on some fields of design which I hope relevant, fruitful, or contextual
to my project.

I will start with \emph{Human-Centered Design}, the grandfather of
design with attitude. There's even an ISO standard for human-centered
design, with the designated code ISO9241-210, revised as ISO
9241-210:2019 titled \emph{``Ergonomics of human-system interaction''}
and up for revision soon (ISO standards are reviewed every 5 years).
Some of the key takeaways include ``Understanding and specifying the
context of use'', ``Involving users throughout design and development'',
``Specifying user requirements'', ``Evaluating designs'',
``Multi-disciplinary Collaboration'', ``Iterative process'' and
``Continual Improvement'', and finally - usability is not enough, the
design should provide a user experience (UX) for human ``emotional
responses and satisfaction'' (ISO, 2019).

While \emph{Human-Centered Design} focuses exactly on what it says -
humans - \emph{Life-Centered Design} recognizes human impact on our
surrounding environment as well - making sure we include non-human
animals among our stakeholders. This is where we are getting on the
\emph{territory} of sustainability. While \emph{Human-Centered Design}
is ever popular, the effect humans are having on biodiversity is rarely
considered when designing. \emph{``{[}T{]}he design phase of a physical
product accounts for 80\% of its environmental impact''} notes(Borthwick
et al., 2022) in their framework for life-centered design.

If we're including \emph{other} lifeforms among our stakeholders, what
can we learn from them? \emph{Biomimicry} is about being inspired by
nature while \emph{Biodesign} focuses on design involving biology in the
design itself. Janine Benyus, who coined the word \emph{Biomimicry}
(Benyus, 2009) looks at very practical cases of innovation where
engineers and biologist meet and (Dicks, 2023) provides a much more
philosophical account of following the example of nature. Focusing on
the financial sector, (Thomas \& Mantri, 2022)'s philosophical account
advocates for an ``inside-out'' design pattern, much like natural
systems, starting from the smallest structures to guarantee resilience
and survival, instead of trying to control their external environment.

In a similar vein, \emph{Material Ecology} is the wording preferred by
the architect Neri Oxman based at the MIT Media Lab working with
biomaterials as a proponent of \emph{Nature-Centric Design} that adheres
to the principles of ecological sustainability with both an ecologically
conscious mindset and practical toolset (Hencz, 2022). Language and our
mental concepts shape our reality, which makes language-creation an
important tool for sustainability. Neri Oxman's expressions in her
(World Economic Forum, 2016) interview introduce some new vocabulary:
\emph{``ecology-indifferent''}, \emph{``naturing''}, \emph{``mother
naturing''}, \emph{``design is a practice of letting go of all that is
unnecessary''}, \emph{``nature should be our single client''}, which
reminds me how self-invented language gives un child-like freedom to
imagine new worlds.

\emph{Multi-Species Design} refers to the idea of considering non-human
life-forms as stakeholders of our design. (D. Metcalfe, 2015)`s PhD
Disseration titled \emph{``The devastating effects that unsustainable
design practices have on the natural world and other species with whom
we share this planet''} gives a good overview of the work done is this
branch of design. In a similar vein, \emph{Biodiversity Inclusive Design
(BID)}, developed by (Hernandez-Santin et al., 2023) through a
systematic review of 14 design frameworks, presents a
\emph{'participatory ladder for non-humans'}; including core design
principles that position species' needs within urban planning to achieve
a biodiversity-positive multi-species environment. Multi-species design
and participatory design can work together. (Haldrup et al., 2022)
examines how participatory design can include non-human species as
co-creators of the urban commons; drawing on cases from Copenhagen,
Denmark and the Viskan River (in the textile town, Borås, Sweden), the
authors highlight sensory and aesthetic encounters, and attempts to
perceive the agency of non-human species in a collaborative design
processes (The University of Melbourne, Australia \& Roudavski, 2020).
Multi-Species Design has also entered the art-world thanks to (Marcus,
06-11-23) who uses artworks to think about how material design
strategies, surface textures, substrates, and bio-inspired composites,
can foster biodiversity and interspecies cohabitation in the built
environment. A very practical example helps one visualize this field the
best. (Kosová et al., 2023) introduces the BioGeo Ecotile, a
eco-engineering tile combining pits, holes, grooves, and crevices to
mimic natural rocky shores and provide multi-species
living-environments; deployed on rock armour and flood walls along
Edinburgh's coast in Scotland, Ecotiles supported significantly higher
intertidal species richness compared to smooth tiles, helping animals
make a life there. (Selvan et al., 2023) goes deep into data modeling
multi-variate calculations on how to build buildings, which support
ecology, coming up with a general framework for the architecture of
building envelopes, that resulted in 20\% higher local species richness
and up to 77\% higher abundance for individual species.

\emph{Speculative Design} can also help us imagine
\emph{non-anthropocentric} (Edwards \& Pettersen, 2023; Hupkes \&
Hedman, 2022) as well as \emph{dystopian} futures (Pinto et al., 2021).
First introduced by (Dunne \& Raby, 2013) in their seminal book, the
field aims to question the intersection of \emph{user experience design}
and \emph{speculative fiction}. (Barendregt \& Vaage, 2021) explores the
potential of speculative design to stimulate public engagement; thought
experiments can spur public debate on an issue chosen by the designer.
Phil Balagtas, founder of The Design Futures Initiative at McKinsey,
discusses the value of building future scenarios at his talk at Google.
His favorite example, the Apple Knowledge Navigator, first appeared in
an Apple vision video in 1987 and took two decades to materialize in the
real world. It was inspired by a similar device first shown in a 1970s
episode of Star Trek as a \emph{magic device} (a term from participatory
design), which then inspired subsequent consumer product development. It
took another two decades, until the launch of the iPhone in 2007 - a
total of 40 years.

\emph{Participatory Design} and \emph{Speculative Design} can be
complementary as in the work of (Neuhoff et al., 2023), used together to
focus on engaging users deep in the design process to truly understand
their needs, contexts and interactions on a non-superficial level. For
both speculative and participatory design, the cost and makes it into a
niche activity. Generative AI holds the promise to allow designers to
dream up and prototype quicker. In order to build a future, it's
relevant to imagine and critique a future. By being quickly generate
prototypes, once can test out ideas with the future users involving more
of the community and stakeholders. To be able to build something, one
first needs to imagine it; imagination is crucial for change.
Speculative Design helps us envision future scenarios and be critical of
the current reality, by taking an alternative view-point. A related
field, \emph{Design Fiction}, goes even further by creating narratives
and artifacts that immerse participants in detailed visions of possible
futures, blending storytelling and tangible experiences. The
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is a source of many
fantastic innovations, used to host The Design Fiction group (from
September 2013 to May 2018), which designed projects to
\emph{``stimulate discussion about the social, cultural, and ethical
implications of emerging technologies''}, coming up with design such as
a Brain-Controlled Interface for Spermatozoa, the Human Perfume,
capturing the smell of the people significant to the author, as well as
Pop Roach, for designing edible cockroaches (A. Liu, 2017;
\textbf{esignfictiongroupGroupOverviewDesign2018?}).

\emph{Regenerative Design} suggests \emph{de}materializing (digitizing)
economies is not enough to be sustainable (by reduction of physical
impact). Design should look beyond reducing harm and find avenues to
\emph{regenerate} damaged or even completely destroyed natural systems
-- ecosystems, biodiversity, land, forests, lakes, rivers - natural
habitats.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Sufficiency
\end{itemize}

Moving from products and (digital) experiences towards the built
environment and architecture, \emph{Climate-Responsive Design} embeds a
building within the environmental constraints of a place and looks for
opportunities use the land, wind, sun, local materials, and local
vernacular history and culture when considering a design. Architect
Susanne Brorson suggests sustainability should be considered in the
earlier phases of design instead of trying to fix problems later,
discussing \emph{climate-responsive design principles} (EVM
maaarhitektuuri keskus, 2019). The sentiment is echoed by (S. Lee \&
Doevendans, 2011) who edited a volume on sustainable approaches of
world-renowned architects: \emph{``The principles of sustainable design
are rooted in the building's relationship to the site and its
environmental conditions such as topography, vegetation, and climate.''}
The pioneering book \emph{Architecture of the Well-Tempered Environment}
laid out ideas for integrating environmental concerns as part of
architecture already in 1980s (Banham, 1999).

\emph{Designing for Trust}, Weinschenk (2011) says \emph{``People expect
most online interactions to follow the same social rules as
person-to-person interactions. It's a shortcut that your brain uses to
quickly evaluate trustworthiness.''}

\emph{Cradle-to-Cradle Design} uses systems thinking focusing on the
reuse, re-manufacturing, and finally - recyclability - of products. The
Taiwanese Design Research Institute (TDRI) hosted a Nordic Circular
Design Forum in Taipei, where Scandinavian circular design practicioners
shared projects from several industries, highlighting how design
requires building relationships; it's not feasible to create a
sustainable product by oneself, as it takes a whole ecosystem (TDRI,
2021; {``台灣設計研究院（{TDRI} ） on {Instagram},''} 2021).

\emph{Durability} is an important dimension for sustainability. High
quality durable products are more sustainable as they last longer and
less likely to be thrown away. Forming an emotional bond with the
product makes it feel more valuable (Zonneveld \& Biggemann, 2014).
(Chapman, 2009) argues in his seminal paper (and later in his book) for
\emph{``Emotionally Durable Design''}, the simple idea that we hold to
things we value and thus they are sustainable. We don't throw away a
necklace gifted to us by mom, indeed this object might be passed down
for centuries. (Rose, 2015) has a similar idea, where \emph{``Enchanted
Objects''} become so interlinked with us, we're unlikely to throw them
away. This has implications for sustainability as the object is less
likely to be thrown away.

As the above shows, there are many partially overlapping design words
created by different people for diverse purposes. Design vocabulary may
be created for distinguishing a particular type of design from another -
or to market oneself as the creator of the word. There are designers who
define / brand themselves by their design method. Design Studies, a
field that studies \emph{design} as a subject.

Food and clothes (I'm omitting housing and transport here) are part of
the immediate environmental impact of college students.

As of 2025, \emph{circular economy} is a tiny part of the world economy.
(Circle Economy, 2022) reported in 2022 only 8.6\% of world economy was
circular and \emph{100B tonnes of virgin materials} was sourced every
year. An early pioneering innovator, (Jackson, 1996) showed through
detailed case studies how \emph{preventive environmental management},
redesigning industrial production at the source can avert pollution,
laying the conceptual groundwork for today's circular-economy models.
Many companies are investing into transforming their processes.
\emph{``{[}T{]}ransition to a low carbon economy presents challenges and
potential economic benefits that are comparable to those of previous
industrial revolutions''} (Pearson \& Foxon, 2012).

\end{itemize}

We're in an industrial revolution. It's possible to re-design entire
industries and that is exactly the expectation sustainability sets on
businesses. Across all industries, there's a call for more transparency.
Conversations about sustainability are too general and one needs to look
at the specific sustainability metrics at specific industries to be able
to design for meaningful interaction. There's plentiful domain-specific
research showing how varied industries can develop eco-designed
products. I will here focus on 3 industries that are relevant for
college students.

\ldots for Provenance and Traceability

Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) also known as Consumer Packaged Goods
(CPG) are large global congloremates operating with low margins and high
volumes (Toh, 2024). The largest of them have several billions in
revenue (Kenton, 2024).

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-32-output-1.pdf}}

Rise of e-commerce has pushed logistics companies to increase delivery
efficiency to keep up with FMCG sales (Deliverect, 2024).

Just like Fast-Moving Consumer Goods, fast fashion operates with low
margins and follows consumer trends. Young people are the largest
consumers of fast fashion ({``Young {Consumers}' ({Complicated}) {Love
For Fast Fashion In} 3 {Stats},''} n.d.). (In European Environment
Agency, 2022 European Environment Agency (EEA)) estimates based on trade
and production data that EU27 citizens consumed an average 15kg of
textile products per person per year. The European Commission wants to
reduce the impact of fast fashion on EU market (ERR, 2022). There are
also other local policy initiatives aiming to tackle the waste problem.
For example the New Standard Institute's proposed ``Fashion Act'' to
require brands doing business in New York City to disclose
sustainability data and set waste reduction targets (Emily Chan, 2022b)
.

In terms of total figures, the 2.4 Trillion USD fashion industry
contributes 2\%-8\% of total global green house gas (GHG emissions),
100B USD is lost to lack of recycling, contributes 9\% of microplastics
(Adamkiewicz et al., 2022). (Centobelli et al., 2022) Fashion industry
year uses 9B cubic meters of water, 1.7B tonnes of CO\textsubscript{2},
92 million tonnes of textile waste. Köhler et al. (2021) Globally 87\%
of textile products are burned or landfilled after 1st consumer use.
(Millward-Hopkins et al., 2023) shows how 50\% of the textile waste in
the UK is exported to other countries, often to be dumped as trash in
landfills or burned. (Tian Macleod Ji, 2024) found fast fashion propels
26 million tons of clothing in China's landfills annually.

Greenwashing is prevalent in the fashion industry. \textbf{Problem}:
Emily Chan (2022a) report says there's not enough transparency in
fashion. In order to tackle this very issue, (Fashion Revolution
Foundation, 2022) launched the fashion transparency index. (Wikirate,
2022b): ``Among the Index's main goals are to help different
stakeholders to better understand what data and information is being
disclosed by the world's largest fashion brands and retailers, raise
public awareness, educate citizens about the social and environmental
challenges facing the global fashion industry and support people's
activism''. Consumer understanding of sustainability is limited. Mabuza
et al. (2023) shows consumer knowledge of apparel coloration is very
limited.

Re-designing industrial food systems for an increasing global population
is a challenge. Supply chain innovation in food industries may enable
more transparency. \textbf{provenance and traceability of food has
implications for sustainability and health.}

Global warming leading to droughts and extreme weather, wars and
conflicts increased volatility in food prices (Eshe Nelson et al.,
2023).

``The agricultural sector contributes to approximately 13.5\% of the
total global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and accounts for
25\% of the total CO\textsubscript{2} emission'' (Nabipour Afrouzi et
al., 2023). Poore \& Nemecek (2018) suggests 26\% of carbon emissions
come from food production. Saner et al. (2015) reports dairy (46\%) and
meat and fish (29\%) products making up the largest GHG emission
potential. Springmann et al. (2021) proposes veganism is the most
effective decision to reduce personal CO\textsubscript{2} emissions.

\textbf{Perennial Crops,} multi-year crops reduce inputs of gasoline,
labor, etc. (Aubrey Streit Krug \& Yin Lu, 2023). Large agritech
companies like Monsanto rely on selling seeds annually for profits
putting them at odds with \textbf{Perennial crops}. Single-year seeds
have led to farmer suicides when crops fail in poor communities.

\emph{Farm to Fork} is a European Union policy to shorten the supply
chain from the producer to the consumer and add transparency to the
system (Financial Times, 2022). A. S. Patel et al. (2023) livestock
products (meat) are 15\% of agricultural foods valued at €152 billion in
2018 globally.

Food fraud is a contentius issue which can be solved with science.

  75\% of fishing is done using industrial Trawling, which has
  environmental impact
\item

\end{itemize}

Complex supply chains make seafood (marine Bivalvia, mollusks) logistics
prone to fraud, leading to financial losses and threats to consumer
health (Santos et al., 2023). (C.-H. Chang et al., 2021) \emph{fish
fraud} is a large global problem but it's possible to use DNA-tracking
to prove where the fish came from. In ``2019, the 27 KURA SUSHI branches
in Taiwan sold more than 46 million plates of sushi. in Taiwan''.
Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IIU) fishing is widespread;
the EU is adopting countermeasures (D. E. Kim \& Lim, 2024). Muñoz et
al. (2023) Is there such a thing as sustainable fishing? Bottom trawling
is the worst and should be banned. Katie Gustafson (2022) proposes a
\textbf{``Uniform traceability system for the entire supply chain''} for
seafood. Mamede et al. (2022) proposes \emph{Seafood tracing}:
Fingerprinting of Sea Urchin.

\textbf{Culture, Community, Cuisine, Storytelling}

Culture can be a proponent of sustainability. Food is about enticing
human imagination and taste buds. Potato used to be a newcomer and
innovative crop in Europe, and now it's so common, Europeans forget it's
no originally from Europe. Food is also about cuisine and culture; foods
become popular if we hear stories and see cuisine around a particular
crop (Aubrey Streit Krug \& Yin Lu, 2023).

\textbf{Food Waste}

There are several initiatives to reduce food waste by helping people
consume food that would otherwise be throw away including Olio and Too
Good To Go.

\subsection{In Practice Sustainability Begins in
Software}\label{in-practice-sustainability-begins-in-software}

Design encompasses most everything in our daily lives. Humans live in
artificial environments where \emph{most} \emph{things} are designed by
humans. The \emph{experiences} we take part in are increasingly created
based on some type of data.

Designing user interfaces for sustainable interactions means
incorporating data and tools to enable designers to make decisions which
reduce the emissions of their designs. Companies like AutoDesk have
introduced CO\textsubscript{2e} calculations inside their design
software, helping designers reduce material usage, energy consumption,
CO\textsubscript{2e} emissions, while increasing potential for reuse and
recyclability (Mike Haley, 2022). Software is key to building more
sustainable products, already for decades (B. B. Gupta et al., 2023).
AI-assisted design enables design for sustainability because the design
process is where sustainability begins. AI has the potential to provide
the parameters for sustainability. (Singh \& Sarkar, 2023) proposes an
AI tool for deciding the suitable life cycle design parameters.

One existing tool, which has been widely used is the En-ROADS climate
change solutions simulator; governments, organizations and individuals
around the world have used it explore climate scenarios based on
interactive changes and visualizations (Climate Interactive, n.d., 2023;
Creutzig \& Kapmeier, 2020; Czaika \& Selin, 2017).

\emph{Digital Sustainability}, information pertaining to emissions would
flow through the economy not unlike the carbon cycle itself.

(Pan \& Nishant, 2023) proposes 6 dimensions of \emph{AI} usage in
\emph{Digital Sustainability}. The chart is purely illustrative to
highlight the value of AI for sustainability; it's not based on numeric
metrics.

\subsubsection{Data-Driven Design}\label{data-driven-design}

Learning from the Growth of Digital Platforms and Superapps.

Data-Driven Design Enables Sustainability. Sustainability touches every
facet of human existence and is thus an enormous undertaking. Making
progress on sustainability is only possible if there's a large-scale
coordinated effort by humans around the planet. For this to happen,
appropriate technological tools are required.

Digital platforms are focused on \emph{Growth Design}, how to
\emph{attract} and \emph{retain} users. Superapps are the latter stage
of the Digital Platform Economy, where previously vertically targeted
apps expand horizontally to provide an ever-increasing number of
services.

For digital products (apps) the main application of interaction design
is for \emph{growth} in usage, how to get more people (user journey and
conversion funnels) to use the product i.e user acquisition, retention,
engagement, and monetization and keep using it (retention and
engagement), often optimizing on-boarding, features, and personalization
(Kende, 2023; Steger, 2019).

Platform economy companies popularized and expanded Data-Driven Design
in the service of growth marketing (also known colloquially as growth
hacking). Capturing User Data was part of this strategy which enabled
improving the products. Digital Product Design is increasingly
data-driven. Digital platforms operate a \emph{design as a process} in a
continuous feedback loop, where \emph{measurements}, \emph{experiments,}
predictive analytics and personalization form a data-drive design
culture. As we humans go about our daily business, governments and
companies track our activities using various technologies, which
produces massive amounts of user interaction data.

Platform economy companies are the capture and use large amounts of data
from users. Data is useful for designing better products. Designing for
high retention (users keep coming back). Network Effects, the more
people use a platform, the more valuable it becomes. Platforms that
continuously add features (provided consumer legislation allows it) may
eventually evolve into superapps, which are useful for providing
services for a wide category of human needs. Bundling many services
under one super-brand. Superapps are possible thanks to Nudge, Economies
of Scale, Network Effects, Behaviour Design. Large Digital Platforms
have a very small number of workers relative to the number of users they
serve. This creates the necessity for using automation for both
understanding user needs and providing the service itself. Creating a
good product that's useful for the large majority of users depends on
\emph{Data-Driven Design.}

Design is as much about how it works as it's about the interface. There
are many approaches to design - from playful to practical to critical
and to data-driven. Nonetheless, many types of design share a common
goal designing for a good \emph{user experience}. Digital product design
can be seen as a specific discipline under the umbrella of Experience
Design. In (Michael Abrash, 2017) Laura Fryer, Meta Oculus augmented
reality incubation general manager, said as much: \emph{``People buy
experiences, not technology.''}

Simplifying.

\emph{Personalization}: the largest businesses today (measured in number
of users) design the whole user experience in order to reach
\emph{Scale}. Intelligent Interfaces use interaction design to provide
relevant and personalized information in the right context and at the
right time. Popular consumer platforms strive to design solutions that
feel personalized at every touchpoint on the user journey (to use the
language of service design) at the scale of hundreds of billions of
users. Businesses care about Total addressable market (TAM), serviceable
addressable market (SAM), target audience (TA), and use hypothesis and
validation for iterating on features, to reach these lofty goals.

\subsubsection{Circular Design for a Circular
Economy}\label{circular-design-for-a-circular-economy}

The bible for Circular Economy, the ``Cradle to Grave'' book was
released over 2 decades ago; change is slow, but change is happening
(McDonough \& Braungart, 2002)

Circular design is only possible if supply chains become circular as
well. (Hedberg \& Šipka, 2021) argues digitization and data sharing is a
requirement for building a circular economy. Yet, sometimes technology
fails. Nonetheless, many current technological hurdles can be overcome
by supply chain professionals who are experts in connecting supply
streams (Dull, 2021). (Oikos Denktank, 2021) argues circular design
requires new skills, one of which is circular material procurement.

To take a specific industyr, digitization of mining systems allows
enhance the reliability of supply chains, and provides better supply
chain transparency (CRM Alliance, 2020). This does not only include
tracking the critical raw materials, but also the social aspects
surround the mine. While this rarely makes the international media,
(Eerola, 2022) maps 20 ongoing mining and mineral-exploration disputes
in Finland, calling for systematic dispute monitoring, in order to
maintain a social license to operate.

The complexity of resource and delivery networks necessitates more
advanced tools to map supply chains (Knight et al., 2022). The COVID19
pandemic - and resulting blockages in resource delivery - highlighted
the need to have real-time visibility into supply chains (Finkenstadt \&
Handfield, 2021). Moreover, in the context of the EU Plastics Strategy,
``the European Commission has launched a pledge to increase the use of
recycled content to 10 million tons by 2025''.

Already in 2020, a company founded to solve these exact issues,
Circularise, and funded in part by the EU Commission H2020 SME
Instrument, developed a privacy-focused blockchain-based data exchange
protocol for tracing plastics across supply chains, aiming to boost
transparency and circularity (Circularise, 2020a). Circularise launched
an ``Open Standard for Sustainability and Transparency'' based on
blockchain technology \& Zero-knowledge Proofs'' Circularise (2020b).
Circularise is currently the market leader in providing \emph{Digital
Product Passports} (Stretton, 2022a).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ``Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (part of the
  Sustainable Products Initiative) is one of the key actions under the
  Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP). The goal of this initiative is to
  lay the groundwork for a gradual introduction of a digital product
  passport in at least 3 key markets by 2024'' ``Connecting the Value
  Chain, One Product at a Time''. ``Circularise aims to overcome the
  communication barrier that is limiting the transition to a circular
  economy with an open, distributed and secure communications protocol
  based on blockchain technology.''
\end{itemize}

It's important in which structure data is stored, affecting the ability
to efficiently access and manage the data while guaranteeing a high
level of data integrity, security, as well as energy usage of said data.
Blockchains are a type of shared database where the data is stored in
several locations with a focus on making the data secure and very
difficult to modify after it's been written to the database. Once data
is written to the blockchain, modifying it would require changing all
subsequent records in the chain and agreement of the majority of
validators who host a version of the database. Blockchain is the main
technology considered for accounting for the various inputs and complex
web of interactions between many participants inside the supply chain
networks.

Several startups are using to track source material arriving to the
factories and product movements from factories to markets and there are
hundreds of paper researching blockchain use in supply change operations
since 2017 (Dutta et al., 2020). Blockchains enable saving immutable
records into distributed databases (also known as ledgers). It's not
possible to (or extremely difficult) to change the same record, only new
records can be added on top of new ones. Blockchains are useful for data
sharing and auditing, as the time and place of data input can be
guaranteed, and it will be easier to conduct a search on who inputted
incorrect data; however the system still relies on correct data input.
As the saying goes, \emph{``garbage in, garbage out''}.

There are several technologies for tracking goods across the supply
chain, from shipping to client delivery. Data entry is a combination of
manual data input and automated record-keeping facilitated by sensors
and integrated internet of things (IoT) capabilities. For example
(Ashraf \& Heavey, 2023) describes using the Solana blockchain and
Sigfox internet of things (IoT) Integration for supply chain
traceability where Sigfox does not need direct access to internet but
can send low powered messages across long distances (for example
shipping containers on the ocean). (Van Wassenaer et al., 2023) compares
use cases for blockchains in enhancing traceability, transparency and
cleaning up the supply chain in agricultural products.

(K. Liu et al., 2023) reports, e-waste is growing 3\%-5\% every year,
globally. (Thukral \& Singh, 2023) identifies several barriers to
e-waste management among producers including lack of awareness and
infrastructure, attitudinal barriers, existing \emph{informal} e-waste
sector, and the need for an e-waste license.

\subsubsection{Tracking Transport Supply Chains: Towards Sustainable
Supply
Chains}\label{tracking-transport-supply-chains-towards-sustainable-supply-chains}

In the most general sense, supply chain transparency enables stakeholder
accountability (Circularise, 2018; Doorey, 2011; J. Fox, 2007). Products
are made from resources distributed across the planet and transported to
clients around the world which currently causes high levels (and
increasing) of greenhouse gases. \emph{``Transport greenhouse gas
emissions have increased every year since 2014''} (\emph{Climate Change
Mitigation}, 2023). Freight (transport of goods by trucks, trains,
planes, ships) accounts for 1.14 gigatons of CO\textsubscript{2}
emissions as per 2015 data or 16\% of total international supply chain
emissions (Yuqing Wang et al., 2022).

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}

In shipping, (Matthew Gore et al., 2022) reports the International

equivalent emissions in shipping 50\% by 2050 compared to 2008. In
aviation, {[}Platzer (2023)\}, a scientist working on the Apollo space
program, calls for emergency action to develop \emph{green aviation}.

Superapps are honeypots of data that is used for many types of behavior
modeling. Guido Becher from Rappi defines their super-app as
``customer-centric high frequency multi-vertical ecosystem'' this
enables cross-promotion, for example a hotel in Argentina targeted
people people who buy almond milk on Rappi with their offer of a yoga
retreat (Phocuswright, 2023; G. Suarez et al., 2021) suggests using
alternative data from super-apps to estimate user income levels,
including 4 types of data: \emph{Personal Information},
\emph{Consumption Patterns}, \emph{Payment Information}, and
\emph{Financial Services}. (Roa et al., 2021) finds super-app
alternative data is especially useful for credit-scoring young,
low-wealth individuals. The massive amounts of data generated by these
companies are used by smart cities to re-design their physical
environments, such as the collaboration between Bolt and the city of
Seville in Spain (Bolt, 2025).

Kakao Pay was found guilty of mishandling 40 million users' data by
handing it over to Alipay without user consent; Alipay owns a 32 percent
stake in Kakao Pay (K. Lee, 2024).

59 million people use Zhixiaobao, an Al financial assistant inside the
Ant Fortune and Ant Insurance mini-apps inside Alipay (Finextra, 2024).

Alipay has build the digital infrastructure to provide thousands of
services to billions of users

Superapps offer a platform with key infrastructure such as payments,
where miniapps thrive Perri (2022); Heath (2021)

\subsubsection{Aspiring Superapps}\label{aspiring-superapps}

There are many companies which aspire to build superapps but are
hindered by various challenges.

Telegram integrates web3 apps into the chat and supports investing into
cryptocurrencies without ever understanding the complex technology of
wallets. Pylarinou (2024)

LINE is integrating web3 technologies based on the Kaia blockchain to
provide decentralized mini-apps (dapps) for the LINE chat userbase and
integrates with the LINE Pay wallet for financial interactions Hintzy

AI labs are putting a lot of effort into engineering likable AIs,
working on honesty of the modelds, teaching them to convey their own
uncertainty (Anthropic, 2024a, 2024b); Which sometimes can go wrong.
ChatGPT-4o overnight became your biggest fan, which users found
annoying; the abrupt shift to an overly enthusiastic persona drew user
backlash (Mollick, 2025). And it also felt jarring, if you already got
used to a certain persona and it suddenly changed.

\emph{Narrative Design,} humans respond well to \emph{storytelling},
making \emph{character design} and \emph{narrative design} relevant to
interaction design. Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are
able to assume the personality of any character that exists inside of
its training data, creating opportunities for automated narrative
design. (Alethea AI, 2021) discusses writing AI Characters, creating a

\subsection{Open Data Enables
Interoperability}\label{open-data-enables-interoperability}

Data is the \emph{interface} between idle resources and retail demand,
which makes \emph{exchange of value} possible. Yet often data is
expensive, hard-to-get, and inaccessible. If done well, open data can
enhance interoperability and enable collaboration (\emph{What Is {Open
Data}?}, n.d.).

While not officially a member, Taiwan is a proponent of Open Government
Partnership (OGP), and has launched its Open Government National Action
Plan, promoting open data, information transparency, and expanding
inclusive public participation (Lab, 2021; Open Government Partnership,
2021). Taiwan's Government Open Data Platform (資料開放平臺), managed by
the Ministry of Digital Affairs, centralizes hundreds of datasets; from
spatial information to energy use (Ministry of Digital Affairs, 2024a).

Open Knowledge International's Global Open Data Index (GODI) ranked
Taiwan as number 1 in its global index in 2017; the project has since
been discontinued, so the ranking may be out of date in 2024 (Open
Knowledge Foundation, 2017).

Data-driven design requires access to data, making the movement towards
\emph{open data sharing} very important. Some countries and cities are
better than others at sharing data openly.

\subsection{Context Design Enables Behavioral Nudges Towards Green
Defaults}\label{context-design-enables-behavioral-nudges-towards-green-defaults}

For several decades, marketing researchers have been looking into how to
affect human behavior towards increasing purchase decisions in commerce,
both offline and online, which is why the literature on behavioral
design is massive. One of the key concepts is \emph{nudge}, first coined
in 2008 by the Nobel-winning economist Richard Thaler; nudges are based
on a scientific understanding of human psychology and shortcuts and
triggers that human brains use and leverages that knowledge to influence
humans in small but powerful ways (Thaler \& Sunstein, 2009).

The principles of nudge have also been applied to sustainability. For
example, a small study (n = 33) in the Future Consumer Lab in Copenhagen
by (Perez-Cueto, 2021) found that designing a ``dish-of-the-day'' which
was prominently displayed helped to increase vegetarian food choice by
85\%. Experiments by (Guath et al., 2022) focused on environmentally
friendly online purchases in Sweden (n = 200) suggest nudging can be
effective in influencing online shopping behavior towards more
sustainable options. A study of behavior change in Australia at large
university setting (N = 156) by (Novoradovskaya et al., 2021) found
nudging behavioral change had a significant effect and the author
suggested it may help to avoid some of the \emph{``16 billion paper
coffee cups are being thrown away every year''} globally (based on the
abstract - I was unable to access the full paper).

Google uses nudges in Google Flights and Google Maps, which allow
filtering flights and driving routes by the amount of
CO\textsubscript{2} emissions, as well as surfacing hotels with Green
Key and EarthCheck credentials, while promising new sustainability
features across its portfolio of products (Sundar Pichai, 2021). Such
tools are small user interface nudges which Google's research calls
\emph{digital decarbonization}, defined by (Implement Consulting Group,
2022) as \emph{``Maximising the enabling role of digital technologies by
accelerating already available digital solutions''}.

In (Kate Brandt \& Matt Brittin, 2022), Google's Chief Sustainability
Officer Kate Brandt set a target of ``at least 20-25\%''
CO\textsubscript{2} emission reductions in Europe to reach a net-zero
economy and the global announcement set a target of helping 1 billion
people make more sustainable choices around the world (Jeni Miles,
2022). In addition to end--users, Google offers digital decarbonization
software for developers, including the Google Cloud Carbon Footprint
tool and invests in regenerative agriculture projects (Google, 2023;
\emph{Inside {Google}'s Regenerative Agriculture Play {\textbar}
{Greenbiz}}, 2021).

Google has launched eco--focused features across its range of products,
most famously Google green routes for driving, which collaborate with
local city governments to have data from the semaphores, which allows
the map to suggest routes which would reduce stopping {``{Google

vuelos seg{ú}n su impacto ambiental}''} (2021); Worthington (2025a)

questions that interaction design is called upon to solve. Hoang (2022):
\emph{``Dynamic interfaces might invoke a new design language for
extended reality''. it's a balancing at: while} AI enables generative
UIs while users need some type of stability (think: text input stays in

Building a community is a way to design a context, where the culture
creates certain expectations of behavior. Humans working together are
able to achieve more than single individuals. ``Any community on the
internet should be able to come together, with capital, and work towards
any shared vision. That starts with empowering creators and artists to
create and own the culture they're creating. In the long term this moves
to internet communities taking on societal endeavors.''

\subsection{Learning from Quantified Self: Tracking Health and
Lifestyle}\label{learning-from-quantified-self-tracking-health-and-lifestyle}

An early example of how tracking personal data enables behavior change,
are health and lifestyle tracking apps. Research on \emph{personal data
tracking} also known as \emph{quantified self} or \emph{self-monitoring}
is abundant. There's substantial academic evidence indicating that
health tracking apps can have a measurable impact on user health
behaviors and increase positive health outcomes. Wearable devices
including the Apple Watch, Oura Ring, Fitbit and others, combined with
apps, help users track a variety of health metrics. Apart from health,
wearable devices have been used to track other metrics such as
physiological parameters of students at school to determine their
learning efficiency (Giannakos et al., 2020). Not only can health
metrics be tracking, but exposure to pollution as well as personal
carbon footprint, are all to some extent track-able (if not traceable).

Recently, npj Biosensing published a device from the MIT Media Lab that
can track cells inside the human body from a wrist-worn device (Jang et
al., 2025; Jarvis, 2025)

\subsubsection{Health and Fitness
Tracking}\label{health-and-fitness-tracking}

Tracking one's health and fitness is a familiar mode of \emph{quantified
self}, available to many smartwatch users - and even pretty much to
anyone who has a phone made in the past decade. Apple is a leader in
health tracking, releasing Apple Health in 2008 as an iOS 8 software
feature and the Apple Watch in 2015, filled with health-focused sensors
and features (Apple, 2022b). In 2022 Apple outlined plans for
\emph{``empowering people to live a healthier day,''} promising a new
set of health-features with every release, such as the rumored
temperature measurement inside of Apple Aipord earphones; and providing
most of this data to developers through Apple's HealthKit health metrics
APIs, which app builders can tap into (Apple, 2022a, 2022c).

Sleep quality is an important aspect of health and many devices and apps
focus on helping people get enough high quality sleep. There's plenty of
academic literature on how physical activity, as well as environmental
aspects, such as air quality, affect sleep (X. Liu et al., 2019) tracks
how wearable data is used for tracking sleep improvements from exercise.
(Grigsby-Toussaint et al., 2017) made use of sleep apps to construct
humans behaviors also known as \emph{behavioral constructs}.

The Oura ring is an example of \emph{calm technology}, providing helpful
data without calling an attention to itself (Phelan, 2024). More
recently, Oura Ring launched an AI-advisor to help explain the health
data recorded by its device: deliver contextual and personalized
guidance, remember past interactions while emphasizing privacy, and
analyze both short- and long-term biometric trends (Team, 2025). There's
value in developing standardized fitness metrics, which different
digital health providers can use to create dashboards with comparable
data. Even with messy data, AI has a useful role as a translator between
different standards.

Could one track personal sustainability in a similar fashion? (G. Shin
et al., 2019)'s synthesis review of 463 studies shows wearable devices
have potential to influence behavior change towards healthier
lifestyles. While the behavior changes may sound simple - like switching
from driving to walking - and would have and effect both on health and
the environmental, they are hindered by factors from personal motivation
to (lack of) suitable urban architecture. (Delclòs-Alió et al., 2022)
discusses walking in Latin-American cities. Walking is the most
sustainable method or transport but requires the availability of city
infrastructure, such as sidewalks, which many cities still lack.

(Saubade et al., 2016) finds health tracking is useful for motivating
physical activity. The urban environment has an influence on health.
(Sanchez et al., 2022) suggests tracking users using their smartphones
and attributing points for actions deemed beneficial - yet this has
potential privacy issues. For any service tracking the user's action,
following privacy UX guidelines is crucial (Jarovsky, 2022b).

Green Finance Platform (2020) report predicts the rise of personalizing
sustainable finance, because of its potential to grow customer loyalty,
through improving the user experience. Similarly to good design,
interacting with sustainable finance for the `green-minded'
demographics, providing a reliable green product is a way to build
customer loyalty. The UN has been handing out Global Climate Action
Awards since 2011 for idea such as the Climate Credit Card in
Switzerland, which automatically tracks emissions of purchases, creates
emissions' reports for the user which can then be offset with
investments in climate projects around the world (UNFCCC, 2023a). Shop

\subsubsection{Carbon Tracking: Personal Emissions
Trackers}\label{carbon-tracking-personal-emissions-trackers}

The founder of the Commons (formerly known as Joro) consumer
CO\textsubscript{2e} tracking app recounts how people have a gut feeling
about the 2000 calories one needs to eat daily, so perhaps daily
CO\textsubscript{2e} tracking could develop a gut feeling about one's
carbon footprint (Jason Jacobs, 2019).

Tracking sustainability may have collective benefits but tracking health
has immediate personal benefits. Health apps feel tangible with
increased well-being while sustainability apps often feel more
collective, long-term and sometimes with benefits too small to matter,
making it harder to motivate individual users.

However, sustainability tracking, while perhaps less than health
tracking, can have a measurable impact. One study of personal carbon
footprint tracking apps (aka CO2 calculators) in a mid-sized German city
(n = 216) helped overall emission reduction by 23\% correlating with
feedback from the app specifically reducing emissions from heating
26.9\%, food 16.4\%, household 34.7\% reduction, and mobility 12\%(S.
Hoffmann et al., 2024).

We have a limited carbon budget so calculating CO2e-cost become
integrated into every activity.

\item
  CO2e calculations will be part of our everyday experience
\item

  currency used for buying and selling goods and services, as well as an
  individual carbon exchange to trade one's carbon permits (S. Zhang,
  2018).

  Echeverría et al. (2022) suggests greener modes of mobility.
\end{itemize}

Personal carbon footprint calculators have been released online, ranging
from those made by governments and companies to student projects.
Similar to personal health trackers, personal CO\textsubscript{2}
trackers help one track emissions and suggests sustainable actions.

however, the paper further suggests that current robo-advisors

making the person lose agency over their financial decisions.

\subsection{Digital Product Passports: Toward Sustainability
Superapps}\label{digital-product-passports-toward-sustainability-superapps}

Sustaining user engagement over time in sustainability tracking apps is
challenging, because the perceived personal benefit and measurable
impact is so minimal - it may feel meaningless.\hspace{0pt}

Towards Tracking Sustainability

Even though this topic belongs under Circular Economy, I've chose to
highlight \emph{digital product passports} here as it's the main design
implication from this chapter - an emerging technology which needs to be
designed for the user.

To contextualize the discussion, a brief historical overview of previous
efforts in this area may be helpful. CO\textsubscript{2e} labeling
initiatives represent an early attempt to communicate the environmental
cost of each product. Using carbon labels to convey CO\textsubscript{2e}
emission of consumer products has been a topic of discussion for decades
(Adam Corner, 2012). Academic literature has looked at minute details
such as color and positioning of the label (S. Zhou et al., 2019).
There's some indication consumers are willing to pay a small premium for
low-CO\textsubscript{2e} products; all else being equal, consumers
choose the option with a lower CO\textsubscript{2e} number (Carlsson et
al., 2022; M. Xu \& Lin, 2022). (Cohen \& Vandenbergh, 2012) argues
labeling the carbon footprint of products does help inform consumer
choice towards sustainability and help promote a green economy. A
large-scale study of UK university students finds some evidence to
suggest labeling low CO\textsubscript{2e} food enables people to choose
a \emph{climatarian diet}, however the impact of carbon labels on the
market share of low-carbon meals is negligible (Lohmann et al., 2022).

Labels alone are not enough - they are insufficient to drive significant
behavioral change. A study in Sweden underlines a negative correlation
between worrying about climate impact and interest in climate
information on products (Edenbrandt \& Lagerkvist, 2022). This latter
finding may be interpreted to suggest a need for wider environmental
education programs among consumers. (Asioli et al., 2022) found
differences between countries, where Spanish and British consumers chose
meat products with \emph{`No antibiotics ever'} over a \emph{Carbon
Trust} label, whereas French consumers chose CO\textsubscript{2} labeled
meat products.

Despite ongoing interest, several studies have shown that the overall
impact of carbon labeling on consumer behavior remains negligible. The
idea of \emph{Carbon Labelling} is yet to find mainstream adoption.

Participation in carbon labeling schemes remains voluntary, with only a
limited number of companies implementing such practices, although their
numbers are gradually increasing. Notable examples include the
U.S.-based restaurant chain \emph{Just Salad} , U.K.-based vegan
meat-alternative \emph{Quorn}, and plant milk \emph{Oatly}, all of which
provide carbon labeling on their products (Brian Kateman, 2020).
(ClimatePartner, 2020): Companies like ClimatePartner and Carbon
Calories offers labeling consumer goods with emission data as a service.
(The Carbon Trust, n.d.): The Carbon Trust reports it's certified 27
thousand product footprints.

\subsection{Human Patterns}\label{human-patterns}

The fact that AI systems work so well is proof that we live in a
measurable world. The world is filled with structures: nature, cultures,
languages, human interactions - all form intricate patterns. Computer
systems are increasingly capable in their ability copy these patterns
into computer models - known as machine learning. As of 2023, 97
zettabytes (and growing) of data was created in the world per year
(Soundarya Jayaraman, 2023). Big data is a basic requirement for
training AIs, enabling learning from the structures of the world with
increasing accuracy. Large data-sets such as the LAION-5B of 5.85
billion image-text pairs, were foundational for training AI to recognize
images (Romain Beaumont, 2022; Schuhmann et al., 2022). Just 3 years
later, \emph{generating} images with GenAI models is now fast enought to
create images in real-time while the user is typing (Dwarkesh Patel,
2024). Similarly huge data-sets exist about other types of media - and
the open Internet itself, albeit less structured, is a data-source
frequently scraped by AI-model builders. Representations of the real
world in digital models enable humans to ask questions about the
real-world structures and to manipulate them to create synthetic
experiments that may match the real world (if the model is accurate
enough). This can be used for generating human-sounding language and
realistic images, finding mechanisms for novel medicines as well as
understanding the fundamental functioning of life on its deep physical
and chemical level (No Priors: AI, Machine Learning, Tech, \& Startups,
2023). Venture capitalists backing OpenAI describe AI as a foundational
technology, which will unlock human potential across all fields of human
activity (Greylock, 2022).

In essence, \emph{human patterns} enable AIs. Already 90 years ago
(McCulloch \& Pitts, 1943) proposed the first mathematical model of a
neural network inspired by the human brain. Alan Turing's Test for
Machine Intelligence followed in 1950. Turing's initial idea was to
design a game of imitation to test human-computer interaction using text
messages between a human and 2 other participants, one of which was a
human, and the other - a computer. The question was, if the human was
simultaneously speaking to another human and a machine, could the
messages from the machine be clearly distinguished or would they
resemble a human being so much, that the person asking questions would
be deceived, unable to realize which one is the human and which one is
the machine? (Turing, 1950).

\begin{quote}
Alan Turing: \emph{``I believe that in about fifty years' time it will
be possible to program computers, with a storage capacity of about
10\textsuperscript{9}, to make them play the imitation game so well that
an average interrogator will not have more than 70 percent chance of
making the right identification after five minutes of questioning.
\ldots{} I believe that at the end of the century the use of words and
general educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able
to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted.''} -
from (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 2021)
\end{quote}

By the 2010s AI models became capable enough to beat humans in games of
Go and Chess, yet they did not yet pass the Turing test. AI use was
limited to specific tasks. While over the years, the field of AI had
seen a long process of incremental improvements, developing increasingly
advanced models of decision-making, it took an \textbf{\emph{increase in
computing power}} and an approach called \textbf{\emph{deep learning}},
a variation of \textbf{\emph{machine learning (1980s),}} largely modeled
after the \textbf{\emph{neural networks}} of the biological (human)
brain, returning to the idea of \textbf{\emph{biomimicry}}, inspired by
nature, building a machine to resemble the connections between neurons,
but digitally, on layers much deeper than attempted before.

Founder of NVIDIA, Jensen Huang, whose computer chips power much of this
revolution, calls it the \emph{``Intelligence Infrastructure''},
produced by intelligence factories, and integrated into everything, just
like electricity was (NVIDIA, 2025). In order to produce this
intelligence, huge AI factories are being built around the world,
measured in the energy requirements. The 500B USD Stargate project, is
currently building 1.2 gigawatts of AI capacity in the Texas, and
expanding to other areas around the U.S., and data center in Abu Dhabi,
U.A.E., which requires 5GW of energy, and is physically bigger than the
country of Monaco (Loizos, 2025; Moss, 2025). In comparison, the 500MW
xAI AI factory, built by Elon Musk's company, powered by natural gas
generators, is moderate in size (B. Wang, 2025). While OpenAIs Sam
Altman is repeatedly quoted as saying the productivity gains created by
AI will far offset any of its environmental footprint or other words to
that effect (Altman, 2024; Di Pizio, 2023), critics like (iGenius, 2020)
argue that AI cannot enable a sustainable future if it is not
sustainable by design; training and delivery of AI products must include
sustainability considerations tied into data intelligence and business
analytics.

\subsubsection{Human Feedback}\label{human-feedback}

Combining deep learning and \emph{reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF)} enabled to achieve levels of intelligence high enough
to beat the Turing test (Christiano et al., 2017; Christiano, 2021; Kara
Manke, 2022). John Schulman, a co-founder of OpenAI describes RLHF
simply: \emph{``the models are just trained to produce a single message
that gets high approval from a human reader''} (Kara Manke, 2022).
Bigger models aren't necessarily better; rather models need human
feedback to improve the quality of responses (Ouyang et al., 2022).

The nature-inspired approach was successful. Innovations such as
\emph{back-propagation} for reducing errors through updating model
weights and \emph{transformers} for tracking relationships in sequential
data (for example in sentences), enabled AI models to became
increasingly capable (Merritt, 2022; Vaswani et al., 2017). Generative
Adversarial Networks*** (GAN), (\textbf{ADD CITATION, 2016}), and
\textbf{\emph{Large Language Models (}ADD CITATION\emph{, 2018)}},
enabled increasingly generalized models, capable of more complex tasks,
such as language generation. One of the leading scientists in this field
of research, Geoffrey Hinton, had attempted back-propagation already in
the 1980s and reminiscents how \emph{``the only reason neural networks
didn't work in the 1980s was because we didn't have have enough data and
we didn't have enough computing power''} (CBS Mornings, 2023). (Epoch
AI, 2024) reports the growth in computing power and the evolution of
more than 800 AI models since the 1950s. Very simply, more data and more
computing power means more intelligent models.

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-41-output-1.pdf}}

Illustration of how transformers work by (Alammar, 2018).

By the 2020s, AI-based models became a mainstay in medical research,
drug development, patient care (Holzinger et al., 2023; Leite et al.,
2021), quickly finding potential vaccine candidates during the COVID19
pandemic (Zafar \& Ahamed, 2022), self-driving vehicles, including cars,
delivery robots, drones in the sea and air, as well as AI-based
assistants. The existence of AI models has wide implications for all
human activities from personal to professional. The founder of the
largest chimp-maker NVIDIA calls upon all countries do develop their own
AI-models which would encode their local knowledge, culture, and
language to make sure these are accurately captured (World Governments
Summit, 2024).

OpenAI has researched a wide range of approaches towards artificial
general intelligence (AGI), work which has led to advances in large
language models(AI Frontiers, 2018; Ilya Sutskever, 2018). In 2020
OpenAI released a LLM called GPT-3 trained on 570 GB of text (Alex
Tamkin \& Deep Ganguli, 2021) which was adept in text-generation.
(Singer et al., 2022) describes how collecting billions of images with
descriptive data (for example the descriptive \emph{alt} text which
accompanies images on websites) enabled researchers to train AI models
such as \textbf{\emph{stable diffusion}} for image-generation based on
human-language. These training make use of \emph{Deep Learning}, a
layered approach to AI training, where increasing depth of the computer
model captures minute details of the world. Much is still to be
understood about how deep learning works; even for specialists, the
fractal structure of deep learning can only be called \emph{mysterious}
(Sohl-Dickstein, 2024).

AI responses are probabilistic and need some function for ranking
response quality. Achieving higher percentage or correct responses
requires oversight which can come in the form of human feedback or by
using other AIs systems which are deemed to be already well-aligned
(termed Constitutional AI by Anthropic) (Bai et al., 2022; J. Bailey,
2023). One approach to reduce non-alignmnet issues with AI is to
introduce some function for human feedback and oversight to automated
systems. Human involvement can take the form of interventions from the
AI-developer themselves as well as from the end-users of the AI system.
Such feedback is not only provided by humans, computer can give feedback
to computers too. Less powerful AIs are taught by more poweful and
aligned AIs, which understand the world better, to follow human values:
for example META used LLAMA 2 for aligning LLAMA 3.

There are many examples of combination of AI and human, also known as
\emph{``human-in-the-loop'',} used for fields as diverse as training
computer vision algorithms for self-driving cars and detection of
disinformation in social media posts (Bonet-Jover et al., 2023; Jingda
Wu et al., 2023). Also known as Human-based computation or Human-aided
Artificial Intelligence (Mühlhoff, 2019; Shahaf \& Amir, 2007). (Ge
Wang, 2019) from the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial
Intelligence, describes core design principles for building interactive
AI systems that augment rather than replace people: value human agency,
granularity of control, transparent interfaces.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{AI as the \emph{Idiot
Savant}}{AI as the Idiot Savant}}\label{ai-as-the-idiot-savant}

Hinton likes to call AI an \emph{idiot savant}: someone with exceptional
aptitude yet serious mental disorder (CBS Mornings, 2023). Large AI
models don't understand the world like humans do. Their responses are
predictions based on their training data and complex statistics. Indeed,
the comparison is apt, as the AI field now offers jobs for \emph{AI
psychologists (ADD CITATION)}, whose role is to figure out what exactly
is happening inside the `AI brain'. Understading the insides of AI
models trained of massive amounts of data is important because they are
\emph{foundational}, enabling a holistic approach to learning, combining
many disciplines using languages, instead of the reductionist way we as
human think because of our limitations (CapInstitute, 2023).

Hinton received a Nobel prize for modeling how the brain works and
coming up with the idea of predicting the next word in a sequence,
already in 1986, which later became the basis for large language models
CBS Mornings (2025)

Standford ``thorough account of the opportunities and risks of
foundation models'' (Bommasani et al., 2021).

Foundation models in turn enabled \emph{generative AIs}, a class of
models which are able to generate many types of \emph{tokens\textbf{,}}
such as text, speech, audio (Kreuk et al., 2022; San Roman et al.,
2023), music (Copet et al., 2023; Meta AI, 2023), video, and even
complex structures such 3D models and DNA structures, in any language
it's trained on. The advent of generative AIs was a revolution in
human-computer interaction as AI models became increasingly capable of
producing human-like content which is hard to distinguish from actual
human creations. This power comes with \emph{increased need for
responsibility}, drawing growing interest in fields like \emph{AI
ethics} and \emph{AI explainability.} Generative has a potential for
misuse, as humans are increasingly confused by what is
computer-generated and what is human-created, unable to separate one
from the other with certainty.

The technological leap is great enough for people to start calling it a
start of a new era.(Noble et al., 2022) proposes AI has reached a stage
of development marking beginning of the \emph{5th industrial
revolution}, a time of collaboration between humans and AI. Widespread
Internet of Things (IoT) sensor networks that gather data analyzed by AI
algorithms, integrates computing even deeper into the fabric of daily
human existence. Several terms of different origin but considerable
overlap describe this phenomenon, including \emph{Pervasive Computing
(PC)} (Y. Rogers, 2022) and \emph{Ubiquitous Computing}. Similar
concepts are \emph{Ambient Computing}, which focuses more on the
invisibility of technology, fading into the background, without us,
humans, even noticing it, and \emph{Calm Technology}, which highlights
how technology respects humans and our limited attention spans, and
doesn't call attention to itself. In all cases, AI is integral part of
our everyday life, inside everything and everywhere. Today AI is not an
academic concept but a mainstream reality, affecting our daily lives
everywhere, even when we don't notice it.

\subsubsection{Algorithmic Experience and Transparency: Before
AIs}\label{algorithmic-experience-and-transparency-before-ais}

Before AIs, as a user of social media, one may be accustomed to
interacting with the feed algorithms that provide a personalized
\emph{algorithmic experience}. Social media user feed algorithms are
more \emph{deterministic} than AI, meaning they would produce more
predictable output in comparison AI models. Nonetheless, there are many
reports about effects these algorithms have on human psychology
\textbf{(ADD CITATION)}.

Design is increasingly relevant to algorithms, - \emph{algorithm design}
- and more specifically to algorithms that affect user experience and
user interfaces. \textbf{\emph{When the design is concerned with the
ethical, environmental, socioeconomic, resource-saving, and
participatory aspects of human-machine interactions and aims to affect
technology in a more human direction, it can hope to create an
experience designed for sustainability.}}

(Lorenzo et al., 2015) underlines the role of design beyond
\emph{designing} as a tool for envisioning; in her words, \emph{``design
can set agendas and not necessarily be in service, but be used to find
ways to explore our world and how we want it to be''}. Practitioners of
Participatory Design (PD) have for decades advocated for designers to
become more activist through \textbf{\emph{action research}}. This means
to influencing outcomes, not only being a passive observer of phenomena
as a researcher, or only focusing on usability as a designer, without
taking into account the wider context.

(Shenoi, 2018) argues inviting domain expertise into the discussion
while having a sustainable design process enables designers to design
for experiences where they are not a domain expert; this applies to
highly technical fields, such as medicine, education, governance, and in
our case here - finance and sustainability -, while building respectful
dialogue through participatory design. After many years of political
outcry (ADD CITATION), social media platforms such Meta Facebook and
Twitter (later renamed to X) have begun to shed more light on how these
algorithms work, in some cases releasing the source code (Nick Clegg,
2023; Twitter, 2023).

The content on the platform can be more important than the interface.
Applications with a similar UI depend on the community as well as the
content and how the content is shown to the user.

\subsubsection{Transitioning to Complexity: Non-Deterministic
Systems}\label{transitioning-to-complexity-non-deterministic-systems}

AIs are non-deterministic, which requires a new set of consideration
when designing AI.

AI systems may make use of several algorithms within one larger model.
It follows that AI Explainability requires \emph{\textbf{Algorithmic
Transparency}.}

\subsubsection{Being Responsible, Explainable, and Safe: Legislation
Adapts and Sets Boundaries for
AI}\label{being-responsible-explainable-and-safe-legislation-adapts-and-sets-boundaries-for-ai}

On March 13 2024, the European Parliament (with 523 votes for and 46
against) the EU AI Law, taking a risk-based approach to a regulatory
framework, which aims to support innovation, while safeguarding
democracy and environmental sustainability (Lomas, 2024). Specifically,
the EU Artificial Intelligence Act (Regulation EU 2024/1689) establishes
the first comprehensive legal framework for AI in the world, aiming to
harmonize rules to ensure that AI systems are safe, human-centric, and
rights-respecting; the act defines a tiered system that bans
unacceptable risks and regulates high-risk uses, imposing transparency
duties on developers of AI systems, for example near-realtime (hourly)
CO2 emissions reports from the AI models (European Union, 2024). As
AI-based solutions permeate every aspect of human life, legislation is
starting to catch up. In order to help international jurisdictions
tailor which incidents and hazards they track and enable
interoperability, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) later also defined 2 types of AI risk, ``AI
incident'' - AI system causes real harm; ``AI hazard'' - potential‐harm
scenario, both which can be raised to ``serious'' variants (OECD,
2024a).

\emph{``As humans we tend to fear what we don't understand''} is a
common sentiment which has been confirmed psychology (Allport, 1979).
Current AI-models are opaque '\emph{black boxes'}, where it's difficult
to pin-point exactly why a certain decision was made or how a certain
expression was reached, not unlike inside the human brain. This line of
thought leads me to the idea of \textbf{\emph{AI Psychologists,}} who
might figure out the \textbf{\emph{Thought Patterns}} inside the model.
Research in AI-explainability (XAI in literature) is on the lookout for
ways to create more \textbf{\emph{Transparency and Credibility}} in AI
systems, which could lead to building trust in AI systems and would form
the foundations for \textbf{\emph{AI Acceptance}}.

The problems of opaqueness creates the field of \emph{Explainable AI}.
(Bowman, 2023) says steering Large Language Models is unreliable; even
experts don't fully understand the inner workings of the models. Work
towards improving both \textbf{\emph{AI steerability}} and
\textbf{\emph{AI Alignment}} (doing what humans expect) is ongoing.
(Holbrook, 2018) argues that in order to reduce errors which only humans
can detect, and provide a way to stop automation from going in the wrong
direction, it's important to focus on making users feel in control of
the technology. There's an increasing number of tools for LLM
evaluation. ``Evaluate and Track LLM Applications, Explainability for
Neural Networks'' (Leino et al., 2018; TruEra, 2023). (P. Liang et al.,
2022) believes there's early evidence it's possible to assess the
quality of LLM output transparently. (Cabitza et al., 2023) proposes a
framework for explainability of AI-expressions to guide XAI research,
focusing on the quality of formal soundness and cognitive clarity.
(Khosravi et al., 2022) proposes a framework for AI explainability,
focused squarely on education, which brings in communication with
stakeholders and human-centered interface design (Holzinger et al.,
2021) highlights possible approaches to implementing transparency and
explainability in AI models, introducing the concept of \emph{multimodal
causability}, where an AI system uses pictures, text, and charts all at
once, which could help the human user see cause and effect across
different kinds of data.

Responsible AI Seeks to Mitigate Generative AIs' Known Issues.

Given the widespread use of AI and its increasing power of foundational
models, it's important these systems are created in a safe and
responsible manner. While there have been calls to pause the development
of large AI experiments (Future of Life Institute, 2023) so the world
could catch up, this is unlikely to happen. There are several problems
with the current generation of LLMs from OpenAI, Microsoft, Google,
Nvidia, and others.

(Christiano, 2023) believes there are plenty of ways for bad outcomes
(existential risk) even without extinction risk. In order to mitigate
these risks (and perhaps to appease the public), all the major AI labs
have taken steps to be more safe. Anthropic, which was founded by former
OpenAI employees, after leaving the OpenAI over this very issue, led the
movement by announcing responsible \emph{scaling policy}
(\emph{Anthropic's {Responsible Scaling Policy}}, 2023). OpenAI itself
announced a dedicated ``Superalignment'' team, co-led by Ilya Sutskever
and Jan Leike; they made a specific promise to commit 20\% of its
compute budget to build an AI system in the next 4 years, that can
itself research and refine alignment methods, effectively solving the
alignment problem for superintelligent AI (which is considered the
highest risk) (Jan Leike \& Ilya Sutskever, 2023). OpenAI has previously
admitted, it does not yet fully understand how the internals of an
neural network work; they are developing tools to represent neural
network concepts for humans (L. Gao et al., 2024; OpenAI, 2024a).
Outside of the major labs, several intependent AI safety organizations
have also been launched, for example METR, the Model Evaluation \&
Threat Research incubated in the Alignment Research Center
(\emph{{METR}}, 2023).

A popular approach to AI safety is \emph{red-teaming}, which means
pushing the limits of LLMs, trying to get them to produce outputs that
are racist, false, or otherwise unhelpful. Mapping the emerging
abilities of new models is a job in itself.

\bottomrule\noalign{}
\endlastfoot
\textbf{Problem} & \textbf{Description} \\
Monolithicity & LLMs are massive monolithic models requiring large
amounts of computing power for training to offer
\textbf{\emph{multi-modal}} \textbf{\emph{capabilities}} across diverse
domains of knowledge, making training such models possible for very few
companies. Shikun Liu et al. (2023) proposes future AI models may
instead consist of a number networked domain-specific models to increase
efficiency and thus become more scalable. \\
Opaqueness & LLMs are opaque, making it difficult to explain why a
certain prediction was made by the AI model. One visible expression of
this problem are \emph{\textbf{hallucinations},} the language models are
able to generate text that is confident and eloquent yet entirely wrong.
Jack Krawczyk, the product lead for Google's Bard (now renamed to
Gemini): ``Bard and ChatGPT are large language models, not knowledge
models. They are great at generating human-sounding text, they are not
good at ensuring their text is fact-based. Why do we think the big first
application should be Search, which at its heart is about finding true
information?'' \\
Biases and Prejudices & AI bias is well-documented and a hard problem to
solve (W. Liang et al., 2023). \textbf{Humans don't necessarily correct
mistakes made by computers and may instead become ``partners in crime''}
(Krügel et al., 2023). People are prone to bias and prejudice. It's a
part of the human psyche. Human brains are limited and actively avoid
learning to save energy. These same biases are likely to appear in LLM
outputs as they are trained on human-produced content. Unless there is
active work to try to counter and eliminate these biases from LLM
output, they will appear frequently. \\
Missing Data & LLMs have been pre-trained on massive amounts of public
data, which gives them the ability for for reasoning and generating in a
human-like way, yet they are missing specific private data, which needs
to be ingested to augment LLMs ability to respond to questions on niche
topics (J. Liu, 2022). \\
Data Contamination & Concerns with the math ability of LLMs.
``performance actually reflects dataset contamination, where data
closely resembling benchmark questions leaks into the training data,
instead of true reasoning ability'' H. Zhang et al. (2024) \\
Lack of Legislation & Anderljung et al. (2023) OpenAI proposes we need
to proactively work on common standards and legislation to ensure AI
safety. It's difficult to come up with clear legislation; the U.K.
government organized the first AI safety summit in 2023 Browne
(2023). \\
\end{longtable}

In 2024, OpenAI released its ``Model Spec'' to define clearly their
approach to AI safety with the stated intention to provide clear
guidelines for the RLHF approach (OpenAI, 2024c).

\subsubsection{Evolution of Models and Emerging
Abilities}\label{evolution-of-models-and-emerging-abilities}

The debate between open source vs closed-source AI is ongoing.
Historically, open-source has been useful for finding bugs in code as
more pairs of eyes are looking at the code and someone may see a problem
the programmers have not noticed. Proponents of closed-source
development however worry about the dangers or releasing such powerful
technology openly and the possibility of bad actors such as terrorists,
hackers, violent governments using LLMs for malice. The question whether
closed-sourced or open-sourced development will be lead to more AI
safety is one of the large debates in the AI industry. In any case, open
or closed-sourced, real-world usage of LLMs may demonstrate the
limitations and edge-cases of AI. Hackathons such as (Pete, 2023) help
come up with new use-cases and disprove some potential ideas. The
strongest proponent of Open Source AI, META, open-sourced the largest
language model (70 billion parameters) which with performance rivaling
several of the proprietary models; because META's core business is not
AI, rather it would benefit from having access to cheaper, better AI
across the board, open-sourcing may be their best strategy (Dwarkesh
Patel, 2024).

Metacognition is defined as \emph{knowing about knowing} (J. Metcalfe \&
Shimamura, 1994) or ``\emph{keeping track of your own learning''} (Zero
Waste Europe et al., 2022). Anthropic's Claude 3 was the first model
capable of Metacognition, promoting it as a feature.

Another important metric is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
performance. Generative AI applications retrieve data from unstructured
external sources in order to augment LLMs existing knowledge with
current information (Leng et al., Mon, 08/12/2024 - 19:46). (Ragas,
2023) suggests evaluating one's RAG pipelines enables
\emph{Metrics-Driven Development}. Likewise, LangSmith, the developer
platform for LLM-powered apps (which makes extensive use of RAG),
dissects the LLM app lifecycle into a pipeline: debug, collaborate,
test, and monitor (LangChain, 2024).

Meta's head AI researcher Yann LeCun predicts LLMs may have reached
their limitations, for innovation AIs need to understand the physical
world and do reasoning in abstract space, which does not require a
language, i.e.~something a cat could do when figuring out where to jump;
in comparison, languages are simple because they are discrete, with very
little noise (NVIDIA Developer, 2025).

\subsubsection{Price of Tokens vs Price of Human
Labor}\label{price-of-tokens-vs-price-of-human-labor}

At the end of the day, the adoption of AI to everyday life, even in the
smallest of contexts, will come down to the price. Long-time AI-engineer
(Ng, 2024) predicts, having seen the roadmaps for the microchip
industries, as well as incoming hardware and software innovations, the
price of tokens will be very low, and much lower than a comparative
human worker.

\subsection{Human Acceptance of Artificial
Companions}\label{human-acceptance-of-artificial-companions}

\subsubsection{Human Expectations Take Time to
Change}\label{human-expectations-take-time-to-change}

\emph{AI acceptance} is incumbent on traits that are increasingly
human-like and would make a human be acceptable: credibility,
trustworthiness, reliability, dependability, integrity, character, etc.
Should AIs be required to disclose they are AIs? (G. Zhang et al., 2023)
found humans are more likely to trust an AI teammate if they are not
deceived by it's identity. It's better for collaboration to make it
clear, one is talking to a machine. One step towards trust is the
explainability of AI-systems.

Humans still need some time to adjust their expectations of \emph{what's
possible} using conversational AI interfaces. (J. Bailey, 2023) believes
people are used to \emph{search engines} and it will take a little bit
time to get familiar with talking to a computer in natural language to
accomplish their tasks. For example, new users of v0, an AI assistant
for building user interfaces through conversation, would tell humans
(the company make this app) about the issues they encounter, instead of
telling the AI assistant directly, even though the AI in many cases
would be able to fix the problem instantly; human users don't yet
necessarily expect computers to behave like another human, there's
\emph{inertia} in the mental model of what computers are capable of,
requiring the user interfaces to provide context and teaching humans how
to interact with their AI coworkers(Rauch, 2024). Indeed, ChatGPT is
already using buttons to explain context (Feifei Liu 刘菲菲, n.d.).

Speaking in the mother language of the users is a way to gain trust.
English is still over-represented in current models so some local models
focus on better understanding local context, such as the Finnish
({``Silo {AI}'s New Release {Viking 7B}, Bridges the Gap for
Low-Resource Languages,''} 2024) focuses on Nordic languages. However,
as time progresses, large, general-purpose LLMs may catch up and
integrate all this knowledge - or even potentially being taught by the
local models.

\subsubsection{Affective Computing: Towards Friendly
Machines}\label{affective-computing-towards-friendly-machines}

\emph{Rosalind Picard} founded the field of \emph{affective computing},
aiming to make computers more human-friendly, pioneering early
approaches to recognizing human emotions with sensors and providing
users experiences that take human emotion into account (Picard, 1997).

It's not an overstatement to say that data from all the processes around
us will define the future of computing (HIITTV, 2021). In the early
examples, electrodermal activity of the skin and heart-rate variance
data were used to detect the emotional state and stress level of the
user (Velmovitsky et al., 2022; Zangróniz et al., 2017). This technology
has since become mainstream in products such as Fitbit and the Apple
Watch, among many others.

\emph{Personal experience:}

\begin{quote}
Apple Watch features Fall Detection, which I've experienced personally.
Riding my bicycle to the NCKU library after rain, I slipped and landed
on my stomach on the pavement. Apple Watch immediately asked me:
\emph{``It looks like you've taken a hard fall''} and offered an option
to call the ambulance. Fortunately I was OK but if I did need
assistance, this AI algorithm delivered contextual help, which could
save my health!
\end{quote}

Affective computing doesn't only rely on sensors. It make use of human
language using the tools of computational linguistics. such as natural
language processing (NLP). Since the first mainframe computers with
rudimentary ability to use pattern matching to respond with simple text
messages, humans have been drawn to discussions of our private lives
with machines. If programmed to be helpful, computers don't necessarily
judge us like a human could. A famous anecdote is about the MIT ELIZA
project (an early examples of a language model) developed by Joseph
Weizenbaum in the mid-1960s, where the lab assistant Pamela McCorduck
would dedicate extended time to talking to the machine in private. The
machine was called ELIZA and would assume the persona of called DOCTOR
to emulate a Rogerian psychotherapist, a style of person-centered
therapy developed by Carl Rogers, from the core idea that positive
psychological functioning is a inherently human motivation (Bassett,
2019; McCorduck, 2004; C. R. Rogers, 1995).

An excerpt from the classic, first-of-a-kind conversation between a
human and a machine (called DOCTOR) in 1965, as documented by (Tarnoff,
2023; Weizenbaum, 1966)

\begin{quote}
User: Well, my boyfriend made me come here.\\
DOCTOR: YOUR BOYFRIEND MADE YOU COME HERE?\\
User: He says I'm depressed much of the time.\\
DOCTOR: I AM SORRY TO HEAR YOU ARE DEPRESSED.\\
User: It's true. I am unhappy.\\
DOCTOR: DO YOU THINK COMING HERE WILL HELP YOU NOT TO BE UNHAPPY?\\
User: I need some help, that much seems certain.\\
DOCTOR: WHAT WOULD IT MEAN TO YOU IF YOU GOT SOME HELP?\\
User: Perhaps I could learn to get along with my mother.\\
DOCTOR: TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR FAMILY.\\
User: My mother takes care of me.\\
DOCTOR: WHO ELSE IN YOUR FAMILY TAKES CARE OF YOU?\\
User: My father.\\
DOCTOR: YOUR FATHER?\\
User: You are like my father in some ways.\\
DOCTOR: WHAT RESEMBLANCE DO YOU SEE?
\end{quote}

Weizenbaum later expressed concerns about how easily humans might be
misled by AIs, by projecting fantasies onto computer systems, cautioning
technologists not to neglect human responsibility from societal
problems; AI is \emph{not} a universal solution (Z.M.L, 2023)

\subsubsection{Artificial Empathy Also Builds
Trust}\label{artificial-empathy-also-builds-trust}

Today's machines are much more capable so it's not a surprise humans
would like to talk to them. One example is \emph{AI Friend} is Replika,
a computer model trained to be your companion in daily life. (Q. Jiang
et al., 2022) describes how Replika users in China using in 5 main ways,
all of which rely on empathy. The company's CEO insists it's not trying
to replace human relationship but to create an entirely new relationship
category with the AI companion; there's value for the users in more
realistic avatars, integrating the experience further into users' daily
lives through various activities and interactions (N. Patel, 2024).

Jakob Nielsen notes two recent studies suggesting human deem
AI-generated responses \emph{more empathetic than human responses,} at
times by a significant margin; however telling users the response is
AI-generated reduces the perceived empathy (Ayers et al., 2023; Nielsen,
2024c; Yidan Yin et al., 2024).

On the output side, (Lv et al., 2022) studies the effect of
\emph{cuteness} of AI apps on users and found high perceived cuteness
correlated with higher willingness to use the apps, especially for
emotional tasks.

\subsubsection{Conversation: A Magical Starting Point of a
Relationship}\label{conversation-a-magical-starting-point-of-a-relationship}

High quality conversations are somewhat magical in that they can
establish trust and build rapport which humans. (Celino \& Re Calegari,
2020) found in testing chatbots for survey interfaces that
``{[}c{]}onversational survey lead to an improved response data
quality.''

There are noticeable differences in the quality of the LLM output, which
increases with model size. (Levesque et al., 2012) developed the
\emph{Winograd Schema Challenge}, looking to improve on the Turing test,
by requiring the AI to display an understanding of language and context.
The test consists of a story and a question, which has a different
meaning as the context changes: ``The trophy would not fit in the brown
suitcase because it was too big'' - what does the \emph{it} refer to?
Humans are able to understand this from context while a computer models
would fail. Even GPT-3 still failed the test, but later LLMs have been
able to solve this test correctly (90\% accuracy) Kocijan et al. (2022).
This is to say AI is in constant development and improving it's ability
to make sense of language.

\emph{ChatGPT} is the first \emph{user interface (UI)} built on top of
GPT-4 by OpenAI and is able to communicate in a human-like way - using
first-person, making coherent sentences that sound plausible, and even -
confident and convincing. M. C. Wang Sarah (2023) ChatGPT reached 1
million users in 5 days and 6 months after launch has 230 million
monthly active users. While it was the first, competing offers from
Google (Gemini), Anthrophic (Claude), Meta (Llama) and others quickly
followed starting a race for best performance across specific tasks
including standardized tests from math to science to general knowledge
and reasoning abilities.

OpenAI provides AI-as-a-service through its \emph{application
programming interfaces (APIs),} allowing 3rd party developers to build
custom UIs to serve the specific needs of their customer. For example
Snapchat has created a \emph{virtual friend} called ``My AI'' who lives
inside the chat section of the Snapchat app and helps people write
faster with predictive text completion and answering questions. The APIs
make state-of-the-art AI models easy to use without needing much
technical knowledge. Teams at AI-hackathons have produced interfaces for
problems as diverse as humanitarian crises communication, briefing
generation, code-completion, and many others. For instance, (Unleash,
2017) used BJ Fogg's \emph{tiny habits model} to develop a
sustainability-focused AI assistant at the Danish hackathon series
Unleash, to encourage behavioral changes towards maintaining an
aspirational lifestyle, nudged by a chatbot buddy.

ChatGPT makes it possible to \emph{evaluate AI models} just by talking,
i.e.~having conversations with the machine and judging the output with
some sort of structured content analysis tools. Cahan \& Treutlein
(2023) have conversations about science with AI. Brent A. Anders
(2022/2023) report on AI in education. Just as humans, AIs are
continuously learning. (Ramchurn et al., 2021) discusses positive
feedback loops in continually learning AI systems which adapt to human
needs. (Kecht et al., 2023) suggests AI is even capable of learning
business processes.

\subsubsection{Multi-Modality: Natural Interactions with AI Systems,
Agents and the Intention
Economy}\label{multi-modality-natural-interactions-with-ai-systems-agents-and-the-intention-economy}

While AI outperforms humans on many tasks, humans are experts in
multi-modal thinking, bridging diverse fields. Humans are multi-modal
creatures by birth. To varied ability, we speak, see, listen using our
biological bodies. AIs are becoming multi-modal by design to be able to
match all the human modes of communication - increasing their humanity.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Fu et al. (2022) Learning towards conversational AI: Survey
\end{itemize}

By early 2024, widely available LLMs front-ends such as Gemini, Claude
and ChatGPT have all released basic features for multi-modal
communication. In practice, this means combination several AI models
within the same interface. For example, on the input side, one model is
used for human speech or image recognition which are transcribed into
tokens that can be ingested into an LLM. On the output side, the LLM can
generate instructions which are fed into an image / audio generation
model or even computer code which can be ran on a virtual machine and
then the output displayed inside the conversation.

The quality of LLM output depends on the quality of the provided prompt.
(Y. Zhou et al., 2022) reports creating an ``Automatic Prompt Engineer''
which automatically generates instructions that outperform the baseline
output quality by using another model in the AI pipeline in front of the
LLM to enhance the human input with language that is known to produce
better quality. This approach however is a moving target as foundational
models keep changing rapidly and the baseline might differ from today to
6 months later.

Multimodal model development is also ongoing. In the case of Google's
Gemini 1.5 Pro, one model is able to handle several types of prompts
from text to images. Multimodal prompting however requires larger
context windows, as of writing, limited to 1 million tokens in a private
version allows combining text and images in the question directed to the
AI, used to reason in examples such as a 44-minute Buster Keaton silent
film or Apollo 11 launch transcript (404 pages) (Google, 2024).

Literature delves into human-AI interactions on almost human-like level
discussing what kind of roles can the AIs take. (Seeber et al., 2020)
proposes a future research agenda for regarding \textbf{\emph{AI
assistants as teammates}} rather than just tools and the implications of
such mindset shift. From assistant -\textgreater{} teammate
-\textgreater{} companion -\textgreater{} friend The best help for
anxiety is a friend. AIs are able to assume different roles based on
user requirements and usage context. This makes AI-generated content
flexible and malleable.

The path from Assistance to Collaboration requires another level of
trust. It's not only what role the AI takes but how that affects the
human. As humans have ample experience relating to other humans and as
such the approach towards an assistants vs a teammate will vary. While
(Lenharo, 2023) experimental study reports AI productivity gains, with
DALL-E and ChatGPT being qualitatively better than former automation
systems, we might still be 1-3 years away from systems that qualify as
team-mates. Once AI reaches that level, would it change how do humans
treat it? Not because the AI might be hurt, but because how it affects
the psyche of the user: this is an area which needs much more attention.
One researcher in this field Karpus et al. (2021) is concerned with
humans treating AI badly and coins the term **``*algorithm
exploitation''**.

\emph{Context of Use,} Where is the AI used? (Schoonderwoerd et al.,
2021) focuses on human-centered design of AI-apps and multi-modal
information display. It's important to understand the domain where the
AI is deployed in order to develop explanations. However, in the real
world, how feasible is it to have control over the domain? Calisto et
al. (2021) discusses \textbf{multi-modal AI-assistant} for breast cancer
classification.

If we see the AI as being in human service. (David Johnston, 2023)
proposes \textbf{\emph{Smart Agents}}, ``general purpose AI that acts
according to the goals of an individual human''. AI agents can enable
\textbf{\emph{Intention Economy}} where one simply describes one's needs
and a complex orchestration of services ensues, managed by the the AI,
in order to fulfill human needs Searls (2012). AI assistants provide
help at scale with little to no human intervention in a variety of
fields from finance to healthcare to logistics to customer support.
OpenAI's ``A practical guide to building agents'' defines and AI agents
as ``Agents are systems that independently accomplish tasks on your
behalf.'' and details step-by-step how to build one (OpenAI, 2025).

AI agents enable workflow automation, with reasoning capability, and
taking actions across different tools, achieving the user's original
\emph{intent}; what's left for the user to do is to say what they want
to achieve. As models get smarter, there's less and less need to build
workflows (chains of thought) manually, as they end up restricting the
model instead of improving the output; the one use case would be to use
a cheaper model with less intelligence and more guardrails set in code
(Latent Space, 2025; Sengottuvelu, 2025). In software development, AI
can already debug problems automatically. Apple uses data from bug
reports to train AI models for improving their software (Saini, 2025).
And it's increasingly possible to generate entire apps from a prompt,
using tools such as Bolt.new (Fanelli, 2024).

\subsubsection{Mediated Experiences Set User
Expectations}\label{mediated-experiences-set-user-expectations}

How AIs are represented in popular media shapes the way we think about
AI companions. Some stories have AIs both in positive and negative
roles, such as Star Trek and Knight Rider. In some cases like Her and Ex
Machina, the characters may be complex and ambivalent rather than
fitting into a simple positive or negative box. In Isaac Asimov's books,
the AIs (mostly in robot form) struggle with the 3 laws of robotics,
raising thought-provoking questions.

AI Assistants in Media Portrayals mostly have some level of
anthropomorphism through voice or image to be able to film; indeed, a
purely text-based representation may be too boring an un-cinematic.

There have been dozens of AI-characters in the movies, TV-series, games,
and (comic) books. In most cases, they have a physical presence or a
voice, so they could be visible for the viewers. Some include KITT
(Knight Industries Two Thousand).

\subsubsection{Roleplay Fits Computers Into Social Contexts: AI Friends
and
Anthropomorphism}\label{roleplay-fits-computers-into-social-contexts-ai-friends-and-anthropomorphism}

\emph{Affective Design} emerged from affective computing, with a focus
on understanding user emotions to design UI/UX which elicits specific
emotional responses (Reynolds, 2001). Calling a machine a friend is a
proposal bound to turn heads. But if we take a step back and think about
how children have been playing with toys since before we have records of
history. It's very common for children to imagine stories and characters
in play - it's a way to develop one's imagination \textbf{\emph{learn
through roleplay}}. A child might have toys with human names and an
imaginary friend and it all seems very normal. Indeed, if a child
doesn't like to play with toys, we might think something is wrong.
Likewise, inanimate objects with human form have had a role to play for
adults too. Anthropomorphic paddle dolls have been found from Egyptian
tombs dated 2000 years B.C. ({``Paddle {Doll} {\textbar} {Middle
Kingdom},''} 2023): we don't know if these dolls were for religious
purposes, for play, or for something else, yet their burial with the
body underlines their importance.

Research on anthropomorphism suggests that giving an AI assistant
stronger human-like cues (high-anthropomorphism) rather than weaker ones
(low-anthropomorphism) leads users to view it more favorably, and this
effect operates through a shorter perceived psychological distance;yet,
even though many studies confirm the benefits of anthropomorphism, the
precise psychological pathway behind those benefits has rarely been
dissected in depth (X. Li \& Sung, 2021). Nonetheless, people are less
likely to attribute humanness to an AI companion if they understand how
the system works, thus higher \emph{algorithmic transparency may inhibit
anthropomorphism} (B. Liu \& Wei, 2021).

Coming back closer to our own time, Barbie dolls are popular since their
release in 1959 till today. Throughout the years, the doll would follow
changing social norms, but retain in human figure. In the 1990s, a
Tamagotchi is perhaps not a human-like friend but an animal-like friend,
who can interact in limited ways.

How are conversational AIs different from dolls? They can respond
coherently and perhaps that's the issue - they are too much like humans
in their communication. We have crossed the \textbf{\emph{Uncanny
Valley}} (where the computer-generated is nearly human and thus
unsettling) to a place where is really hard to tell a difference. And if
that's the case, are we still playing?

Should the AI play a human, animal, or robot? Anthropomorphism can have
its drawbacks; humans have certain biases and preconceptions that can
affect human-computer interactions. For example, somewhat curiously,
(Pilacinski et al., 2023) reports humans were less likely to collaborate
with red-eyed robots.

The AI startups like Inworld and Character.AI have raised large rounds
of funding to create characters, which can be plugged in into online
worlds, and more importantly, remember key facts about the player, such
as their likes and dislikes, to generate more natural-sounding dialogues
(Wiggers, 2023).

Is anthropomorphism, being human-like necessary? (Savings literature
says it is) Or does being another animal also work? Animal-like: Some
have an avatar, some not. I've created a framework for categorization.
Human-like or not\ldots{} etc

As AIs became more expressive and able to to \textbf{roleplay}, we can
begin discussing some human-centric concepts and how people relate to
other people. AI companions, AI partners, AI assistants, AI trainers -
there's are many \textbf{roles} for the automated systems that help
humans in many activities, powered by artificial intelligence models and
algorithms.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  RQ: Do college students prefer to talk to an Assistant, Friend,
  Companion, Coach, Trainer, or some other Role?
\item
  RQ: Are animal-like, human-like or machine-like AI companions more
  palatable to college students?
\end{itemize}

Humans (want to) see machines as human {[}ADD CITATION{]}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  There is also the question of who takes responsibility for the actions
  take by the AI agent. ``Organization research suggests that acting
  through human agents (i.e., the problem of indirect agency) can
  undermine ethical forecasting such that actors believe they are acting
  ethically, yet a) show less benevolence for the recipients of their
  power, b) receive less blame for ethical lapses, and c) anticipate
  less retribution for unethical behavior.'' (Gratch \& Fast, 2022)
\item

  Human-Like Artificial Intelligence''
\item
  Martínez-Plumed et al. (2021) envisions the future of AI ``Futures of
  artificial intelligence through technology readiness levels''
\item
  The number of AI-powered assistants is too large to list here. I've
  chosen a few select examples in the table below.
\end{itemize}

Non-Anthropomorphic, machine-like AIs have been with us for a while. The
Oxford Internet Institute defines AI simply as \textbf{\emph{``computer
programming that learns and adapts''}} (Google \& The Oxford Internet
Institute, 2022). Google started using AI in 2001, when a simple machine
learning model improved spelling mistakes while searching; now in 2023
most of Google's products are are based on AI (Google, 2022). Throughout
Google's services, AI is hidden and calls no attention itself. It's
simply the complex system working behind the scenes to delivery a result
in a barebones interface.

The rising availability of AI assistants may displace Google search with
a more conversational user experience. Google itself is working on tools
that could cannibalize their search product. The examples include Google
Assistant, Google Gemini (previously known as Bard) and large
investments into LLMs.

Everything that existed before OpenAI's GPT 4 has been blown out of the
water.

Pre-2023 literature is somewhat limited when it comes to AI companions
as the advantage of LLMs has significantly raised the bar for AI-advisor
abilities as well as user expectations.

Some evergreen advice most relates to human psychology which has
remained the same. (Haugeland et al., 2022) discusses
\textbf{\emph{hedonic user experience}} in chatbots and (Steph Hay,
2017) explains the relationship between emotions and financial AI.

Conversational chatbot Replika was launched in 2017 and in 2024 was used
by 30 million people; the focus is on empathetic dialogue to support
mental well being, sort of like a friend, a digital companion, (or even
a romantic partner, in paid versions of the app), and includes an
animated avatar interface (Eugenia Kuyda, 2023). Replika can ask probing
questions, tell jokes, and learning about your personality and
preferences to generate more natural-sounding conversations.

Before AI, chatbots struggled with evolving human language,
understanding the complexity of context, irregular grammar, slang, etc
(Lower, 2017).

(Isabella Ghassemi Smith, 2019) early performance metrics of AI-driven
features across financial markets show that AI outperforms traditional
quant strategies, which will lead to wider adoption of autonomously
generated investment signals.

\subsection{Interfaces for Human-Computer
Interaction}\label{interfaces-for-human-computer-interaction}

\subsubsection{Speech Makes Computers Feel
Real}\label{speech-makes-computers-feel-real}

Voice has a visceral effect on the human psyche; since birth we
recognize the voice of our mother. The voice of a loved one has a
special effect. Voice is a integral part of the human experience.
Machines that can use voice in an effective way are closer to
representing and affecting human emotions.

Voice assistants such as Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa are well-known
examples of AI technology in the world. Amazon's Rohit Prasad thinks it
can do so much more, ``Alexa is not just an AI assistant -- it's a
trusted advisor and a companion'' (Prasad, 2022).

\end{itemize}

Some research suggests that voice UI accompanied by a \emph{physical
embodied system} is the preffered by users in comparison with voice-only
UI (Celino \& Re Calegari, 2020).

There's evidence across disciplines about the usefulness of AI
assistants:

  to be like humans or places''
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Generative UIs Enable Flexibility of
Use}\label{generative-uis-enable-flexibility-of-use}

The `grandfather' of user experience design, (Nielsen, 2024a) recounts
how 30 years of work towards usability has largely failed - computers
are still not accessible enough (\emph{``difficult, slow, and
unpleasant''}) - and has hope Generative UI could offer a chance to
provide levels of accessibility humans could not. The promise of
\emph{Generative User Interfaces} (GenUI) is to dynamically provide an
interface appropriate for the particular user and context. The advances
in the capabilities of LLMs makes it possible to achieve \emph{user
experience (UX) which previously was science fiction}. AI is able to
predict what kind of UI would the user need right now, based on the data
and context. Generative UIs are largely invented in practice, based on
user data analysis and experimentation, rather than being built in
theory. Kelly Dern, a Senior Product Designer at Google lead a workshop
in early 2024 on \emph{GenUI for product inclusion} aiming to create
\textbf{\emph{``\textbf{more accessible and inclusive {[}UIs for{]}
users of all backgrounds}''.}} (Matteo Sciortino, 2024) coins the phrase
RTAG UIs \emph{``real-time automatically-generated UI interfaces''}
mainly drawing from the example of how his Netflix interface looks
different from that of his sister's because of their distinct usage
patterns.

While (Fletcher, 2023) and (Joe Blair, 2024) are worried about UIs
becoming average: more and more similar to the lowest common
denominator. Yet, when we can generate better UIs (UI orchestration,
crafting ``systems of intent'', as (Nielsen, 2025) calls it) that are
based on user data and would be truly personalized. Software itself can
increasingly be generated by AI systems (i.e.~machines making machines).
As machines become more capable, machines will eventually be capable of
producing machines. Already a decade ago in 2014, the eminent journal
\emph{Information Sciences} decided to dedicate a special section to
AI-generated software to call attention to this tectonic shift in
software development (Reformat, 2014). Replit, a startup known for
allowing user build apps in the web browser, released Openv0, a
framework of AI-generated UI components. \emph{``Components are the
foundation upon which user interfaces (UI) are built, and generative AI
is unlocking component creation for front-end developers, transforming a
once arduous process, and aiding them in swiftly transitioning from idea
to working components''} (Replit, 2023). Vercel introduced an
open-source prototype UI-generator called V0 which used large language
models (LLMs) to create code for web pages based on text prompts
(Vercel, 2023). Other similar tools quickly following including Galileo
AI, Uizard AutoDesigner and Visily (\emph{Who {Benefits} the Most from
{Generative UI}}, 2024). NVIDIA founder Jensen Huang makes the idea
exceedingly clear, saying \emph{``Everyone is a programmer. Now, you
just have to say something to the computer''} (Leswing, 2023).

The history of \emph{intelligent interfaces} is long (Kobetz, 2023).
({``Generative {UI Design},''} 2023) gives an overview of the history of
generative AI design tools going back in time until 2012 when (Troiano
\& Birtolo, 2014) proposed genetic algorithms for UI design.

There's wide literature available describing human-AI interactions
across varied scientific disciplines. While the fields of application
are diverse, some key lessons can be transferred horizontally across
fields of knowledge.

Many large corporations have released guidelines for Human-AI
interaction. Mikael Eriksson Björling \& Ahmed H. Ali (n.d.) Ericcson AI
UX.

McKeough (2018) business consultancies have begun to recognize the
importance of design to business. They advise their corporate clients to
bring user experience design to the core of their business operations.

There's a number of user interface design patterns that have provide
successful across a range of social media apps. Such \emph{user
experience / user interface} (UX/UI) patterns are copied from one app to
another, to the extent that the largest apps share a similar look and
feature set. Common UX/UI parts include the Feed and Stories. By using
common UI parts from social media users have an easier time to accept
the innovative parts. add Viz charts. Avatars are increasingly common
and new generations are used to talking to computers.

There are also more philosophical approaches to \emph{Interface
Studies}. (David Hoang, 2022), the head of product design at Webflow,
suggests taking cues from art studies to \emph{isolate the core
problem}: \emph{``An art study is any action done with the intention of
learning about the subject you want to draw''}. As a former art student,
Hoang looks at an interface as \emph{``a piece of design is an artwork
with function''}. Indeed, art can be a way to see new paths forward,
practicing ``\emph{fictioning}'' to deal with problematic legacies
({``Review of the 2023 {Helsinki Biennial},''} 2023).

Usability sets the baseline but AI-interfaces are capable of more.

The user experience (UX) of AI is a topic under active development by
all the largest online platforms. The general public is familiar with
the most famous AI helpers, ChatGPT, Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa,
Microsoft's Cortana, Google's Assistant, Alibaba's Genie, Xiaomi's Xiao
Ai, and many others. For general, everyday tasks, such as asking factual
questions, controlling home devices, playing media, making orders, and
navigating the smart city.

\item
  AI is usually a model that spits out a number between 0 and 1, a

\end{itemize}

Design starts with understanding human psychology. (Donghee Shin, 2020)
looks at user experience through the lens of \emph{usability of
algorithms} - focusing on users' cognitive process allows one appreciate
how product features are received by the brain and transformed into
experiences by interacting with the algorithm.

(J. Bailey, 2023) believes people will increasingly use AI capabilities
through UIs that are specific to a task rather than generalist
interfaces like ChatGPT.

Usability Guidelines

Microsoft Co-Founder predicted in 1982 \emph{``personal agents that help
us get a variety of tasks''} (Bill Gates, 1982) and it was Microsoft
that introduced the first widely available personal assistant in 1996,
called Clippy, inside the Microsoft Word software. Clippy was among the
first assistants to reach mainstream adoption, helping users not yet
accustomed to working on a computer, to get their bearings (Tash
Keuneman, 2022). Nonetheless, it was in many ways useless and intrusive,
suggesting there was still little knowledge about UX and human-centered
design. Gates never wavered though and is quoted in 2004 saying
\emph{``If you invent a breakthrough in artificial intelligence, so
machines can learn, that is worth 10 Microsofts''} Lohr (2004). Gates
updated his ideas in 2023 focuses on the idea of \emph{AI Agents}
(Gates, 2023).

As late as in 2017, scientists were trying to create a program with
enough \emph{natural-language understanding} to extract basic facts from
scientific papers (Stockton, 2017).

Might we try again?

With the advent of ChatGPT, the story of Clippy has new relevance as
part of the history of AI Assistants. Benjamin Cassidy (2022) and
Abigail Cain (2017) illustrate beautifully the story of Clippy and Tash
Keuneman (2022) ask poignantly: ``We love to hate Clippy --- but what if
Clippy was right?''

\subsubsection{Human-Computer Interactions Without a
``Computer''}\label{human-computer-interactions-without-a-computer}

How does AI affect Human-Computer Interactions

The field of Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) emphasizes designing
user experiences (UX) that cater to human needs (The International
Ergonomics Association, 2019). Designers think through every interaction
of the user with a system and consider a set of metrics at each point of
interaction including the user's context of use and emotional needs.

Software designers, unlike industrial designers, can't physically alter
the ergonomics of a device, which should be optimized for human
well-being to begin with and form a cohesive experience together with
the software. However, software designers can significantly reduce
mental strain by crafting easy-to-use software and user-friendly user
journeys. Software interaction design goes beyond the form-factor and
accounts for human needs by using responsive design on the screen, aural
feedback cues in sound design, and even more crucially, by showing the
relevant content at the right time, making a profound difference to the
experience, keeping the user engaged and returning for more. In the
words of (Babich, 2019), \textbf{\emph{``}}{[}T{]}he moment of
interaction is just a part of the journey that a user goes through when
they interact with a product. User experience design accounts for all
user-facing aspects of a product or system''.

Drawing a parallel from narrative studies terminology, we can view user
interaction as a heroic journey of the user to achieve their goals, by
navigating through the interface until a success state - or facing
failure. Storytelling has its part in interface design however designing
for transparency is just as important, when we're dealing with the
user's finances and sustainability data, which need to be communicated
clearly and accurately, to build long-term trust in the service. For a
sustainable investment service, getting to a state of success - or
failure - may take years, and even longer. Given such long timeframes,
how can the app provide support to the user's emotional and practical
needs throughout the journey?

(Tubik Studio, 2018) argues \emph{affordance} measures the
\emph{clarity} of the interface to take action in user experience
design, rooted in human visual perception, however, affected by
knowledge of the world around us. A famous example is the door handle -
by way of acculturation, most of us would immediately know how to use it
- however, would that be the case for someone who saw a door handle for
the first time? A similar situation is happening to the people born
today. Think of all the technologies they have not seen before - what
will be the interface they feel the most comfortable with?

For the vast majority of this study's target audience (college
students), social media can be assumed as the primary interface through
which they experience daily life. The widespread availability of mobile
devices, cheap internet access, and AI-based optimizations for user
retention, implemented by social media companies, means this is the
baseline for young adult users' expectations (as of writing in 2020).

(Don Shin et al., 2020) proposes the model (fig.~10) of Algorithmic
Experience (AX) \emph{``investigating the nature and processes through
which users perceive and actualize the potential for algorithmic
affordance''} highlighting how interaction design is increasingly
becoming dependent on AI. The user interface might remain the same in
terms of architecture, but the content is improved, based on
personalization and understanding the user at a deeper level.

In 2020 (when I proposed this thesis topic), Google had recently
launched an improved natural language engine to better understand search
queries ({``Understanding Searches Better Than Ever Before,''} 2019),
which was considered the next step towards \emph{understanding} human
language semantics. The trend was clear, and different types of
algorithms were already involved in many types of interaction design,
however, we were in the early stages of this technology (and still are
\emph{early} in 2024). Today's ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini have no
problem understanding human semantics - yet are they intelligent?

Intelligence may be besides the point as long as AI \emph{becomes very
good at reasoning}. AI is a \emph{reasoning engine} (Bubeck et al.,
2023; Shipper, 2023; see J. Bailey, 2023 for a summary). That general
observation applies to voice recognition, voice generation, natural
language parsing, among others. Large consumer companies like McDonald's
are in the process of replacing human staff with AI assistants in the
drive-through, which can do a better job in providing a personal service
than human clerks, for whom it would be impossible to remember the
information of thousands of clients. In (Barrett, 2019), in the words of
\emph{Easterbrook}, a previous CEO of McDonald's \emph{``How do you
transition from mass marketing to mass personalization?''}

Should AIs look anthropomorphic or fade in the background? It's an open
question. Perhaps we can expect a mix of both depending on the context
of use and goals of the particular AI.

(Aschenbrenner, 2024) predicts ``drop-in virtual coworkers'', AI-agents
who are able to use computer systems like a human seamlessly replacing
human employees.

\subsubsection{Roleplay for Financial
Robo-Advisors}\label{roleplay-for-financial-robo-advisors}

\emph{Robo-advisors} is a fintech term that was in fashion largely
before the arrival of AI assistants and has been thus superseded by
newer technologies. Ideally, robo-advisors can be more dynamic than
humans and respond to changes to quickly and cheaply. Human advisors are
very expensive and not affordable for most consumers. (Capponi et al.,
2019) argues \emph{``The client has a risk profile that varies with time
and to which the robo-advisor's investment performance criterion
dynamically adapts''}. The key improvement of \emph{personalized
financial advice} is understanding the user's \emph{dynamic risk
profile}.

In the early days of robo-advisory, Germany and the United Kingdom led
the way with the most robo-advisory usage in Europe (Cowan, 2018). While
Germany had 30+ robot-advisors on the market in 2019, with a total of
3.9 billion EUR under robotic management, it was far less than
individual apps like Betterment managed in the US (Bankinghub, 2019).
Already in 2017, several of the early robo-advisors apps have shut down
in the UK (AltFi, 2017). ETFmatic gained the largest number of downloads
by 2017, focusing exclusively on exchange-traded funds (ETFs), tracking
stock-market indexes automatically, with much less sophistication, than
their US counterparts {[}ibid{]}. The app was bought by a bank in 2021
and closed down in 2023 (AltFi, 2021; {``{ETFmatic} - {Account} Funding
of {EURO} Accounts Ceases,''} 2023; Silva, 2023).

\begin{figure}[H]

}

\caption{Out-of-date user interface of a European AI-Advisor ETFmatic in
2017 which was closed down in 2023 (Photo copyright ETFmatic)}

\end{figure}%

Some relevant papers include a comparison of robot advisors by (Barbara
Friedberg, 2021) and (Slack, 2021)'s account of how before Generative
AI, financial chatbots were developed manually using a painstaking
process that was slow and error-prone, for example using the Atura
Process. Older financial robo-advisors, built by fintech companies
aiming to provide personalized suggestions for making investments such
as Betterment and Wealthfront are forced to upgrade their technology to
keep up.

While the financial AI companion apps in the US market are ahead
globally, they are not yet using many of the user experience innovations
that are prevalent on social media platforms targeted at Gen-Z and/or
Millennials, possibly presenting an opportunity for cross-industry
knowledge transfer, from businesses that are traditionally closer to the
consumer - such as retailers. Financial AI companion apps have not yet
grown to mainstream scale in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Europe,
being for the moment a largely US-based retail investor trend. The apps
outside of the US are niche products in a nascent stage, however, they
still provide relevant design directions or stories of what to avoid.
The user interface and user experience (UI/UX) of consumer-focused
investing apps in Europe has improved a over the past decade. The
changing landscape is related to the earlier availability of better
quality apps available in the US and the disappearance of the 1st
generation of rudimentary investing apps and the lessons learned on how
to automate the delivery of financial services while increasing user
satisfaction.

Robo-advisors compete with community investing such as hedge funds,
mutual funds, copy-trading, and DAOs with treasuries. Robo-Advisor do
not have the type of social proof a community-based investment vehicle
has. The question is, does the user trust the robot or a human.

In India, research is being conducted on how AI advisors could assist
with investors' erratic behavior in stock market volatility situations,
albeit without much success (Bhatia et al., 2020). India had more than
2000 fintechs since 2015 (Migozzi et al., 2023).

Newer literature notes robo-advisor related research is scattered across
disciplines (H. Zhu et al., 2024).

Athropomorphism: human-like attributes in robo-advisors, such as
conversational chatbots, can affect adoption and risk preferences among
customers. Studies show that anthropomorphic robo-advisors increase
customer trust and reduce algorithm aversion.'' \textbf{similar to my

\subsection{The Convergence of Money: One Wallet to Rule Shopping,
Saving, and
Investing}\label{the-convergence-of-money-one-wallet-to-rule-shopping-saving-and-investing}

This chapter explores how money could incorporate sustainability as a
feature.

\begin{quote}
``Money is information\ldots{} it shouldn't be more expensive or slower
than sending an email.'' (K. Käärmann, Co-Founder of the Wise , formerly
known as Transferwise, money transfer platform), said in 2018 (Käärmann,
2018)
\end{quote}

\emph{Money} itself is changing and the meaning of money is becoming
more diverse. Traditionally, money referred to the fiat money created by
governments by law, using central banks, which loan money to commercial
banks, that in turn make it available to the society. Now, we also have
new types of money created by companies and individuals using
blockchain-cryptography based distributed databases, which keep track of
transactions (who-paid-whom). We have various types of tokens of value,
such as cryptocurrencies, digital assets, loyalty points, etc, which can
all function as types of money. Whatever the method of creation, in
essence, money is a \emph{system of trust} where \emph{something} is
used as a \emph{medium of value exchange} and accepted by \emph{other
people} as payment.

\subsubsection{Spurred by Fintech: The Democratization of Finance: A
Precursor for Sustainable
Superapps}\label{spurred-by-fintech-the-democratization-of-finance-a-precursor-for-sustainable-superapps}

Digital money in it's various forms connects industries on popular
financial mobile apps, which makes digital money more accessible and
socially engaging, appealing to people who are active online. Because of
the \emph{democratization of finance} enabled by digitization and
financial technologies\emph{,} the journey from consumer to investor is
becoming increasingly simple\emph{.} Consumer-oriented financial apps
increasingly enable new user interactions which blur boundaries between
shopping, saving, and investing - termed here \emph{``money
convergence''}. Empowering consumers to access finance through digital
technologies and delivering a simple user experience is the fintech
trend of the last decade. Motivated by boosting user numbers, apps such
as N26 and Revolut, that started out with only payments-focused
businesses, founded in 2013 and 2015, respectively, began making efforts
to expand into all-in-one financial superapps offering varied saving and
investing services ({``Kickstart Your Investment Journey,''} 2023;
{``Revolut Launches {ETF} Trading Platform in {Europe},''} 2023).

While it took N26 and Revolut more than a decade to grow into a global
business, fintechs can growth really fast. Just last year in Canada, Neo
Financial, which offers a mobile app and credit cards to consumers
featuring cashback rewards on payments, savings and investing, won
Canada's fastest growing company award in 2024, posting a 3-year revenue
growth of 38,431\% earning between \$75M and \$100M USD in annual
revenue from 1.3 million customers ({``Ranking {Canada}'s {Top Growing
Companies} of 2024,''} 2024). (Qorus, 2023)~a survey of 200 banking
executives worldwide, revaled we're in a digital banking revolution,
with growing adoption of personalization, automation, and \emph{embedded
finance} - the availability of savings, loans, insurance, debit cards,
and investment opportunities embedded within the apps of non-financial
platforms, like e-commerce or social media platforms.

\subsubsection{Financial Literacy and Education: Young Investors Follow
Financial
Influencers}\label{financial-literacy-and-education-young-investors-follow-financial-influencers}

Young investors are typically \emph{retail investors} investing small
amounts of money for themselves. (Unless they have inherited wealth or
are among the very few who work in an institution such as an investment
firm, university endowment, pension fund or mutual fund, and have a say
in where to invest large amounts of other peoples' money.) Retail
investors face many challenges in comparison with their institutional
counterparts. For instance, they may have much less time to do proper
research, face information asymmetries, where finding good information
is limited by time, ability, as well as financial literacy, whereas
professional investors have the tools, skills, time, and knowledge, to
make better investment decisions.

The common expectation is that young investors typically have less
understanding financial concepts. While consumers are beginning to
become more money-savvy, they still lag in both financial and
sustainability literacy. Financial and sustainability literacy are
intertwined. Integrating these literacies is essential, because a
financially informed public is better equipped to channel capital toward
environmentally beneficial uses. Media plays a significant role here,
with retail investing being heavily influenced by social media
influencers.

Popular financial blogger (Austin Ryder, 2020) believes a good starting
point is ask the user to define their habits: are you consumer or
investor? This helps users recognize whether their spending habits
define them primarily as consumers or as investors. (SmartWealth, 2021)
urges readers to ``consume knowledge, not products''; for financial
health one should get rid of debt, automate tracking of expenses and
savings, and create a pathway for income to flow into investments.
Consumer mindset is the main obstacle that keeps people from financial
independence and investing.

The next step is to provide frictionless digital pathways that let
everyday purchases morph into micro-investments with transparent
sustainability impacts. This user journey is a type of blended
learning-by-doing experience. Framing the problem as a dual journey:
first, helping users recognise whether their spending habits define them
primarily as consumers or as investors, then giving users exposure to
investment opportunities through familiar activities like shopping may
hold the potential to boost financial literacy levels, enticing
consumers to learn more about taking advantage of their financial
opportunities as well as understanding how to manage the types or risk
involved. Indeed, retail investor are the most vulnerable to
misinformation and speculative hype if educational scaffolding is
absent.

Financial superapps for shopping, saving, and investing are converging
on digital platforms, aiming to permeate our daily financial lives, with
features such banking, payments, transfers, rewards and cashback
programs (e.g.~Rakuten), automated micro-investing round-up to next
dollar (e.g.~Acorn, Stash, Swedbank, many others), retail investing
(Robinhood, Public, Lightyear), copy-trading (eToro) and offering
various investment vehicles, to name just a few: (fractional shares of)
stocks, derivatives like CFDs and futures, microloans (Kiva),
commodities and precious metals such as gold and silver (Revolut),
physical assets such as real estate, land, forest and digital assets
such as cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and many other alternative assets of
varied price, volatility, liquidity, and risk profile.

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-47-output-1.pdf}}

Community-based copy-trading apps live on the intersection of social
media and investing, enabling financial inclusion through letting
novice, inexperienced investors piggy-back on more sophisticated
investors by copying their investments. In some ways community-investing
competes with robo-advisors as communities can be led by professional
investors and followed by less sophisticated investors. Because of this
investing leadership aspect, investor communities can have the type of
\emph{social proof}, which robo-advisor do not possess. eToro's,
Robinhood's and Dub's copy trade feature turn portfolios, watch-lists
and trade votes into public content (dub, 2025). The visible social
proof approach can feel safer than robo-adviser; retail investors cite
seeing what others do an important trust trigger (Andraszewicz et al.,
2023).

Evidence of a similar phenomenon of peer behavior measurably shifting
sustainability choices has been documented in the entreprise sector in
green financing of Chinese industries, albeit in a modest 1--2\%
increase (incremental nudges); companies tend to invest green when they
see when other companies signal a green preference (S. Yang et al.,
2022). In a Swedish study, investors' belief in sustainable investing
was found to be affected by other investors: an online coordination game
with 559 private investors showed that 2nd-order pro-sustainable beliefs
(\emph{what one thinks others care about}) also drove up sustainable
asset allocations, underlining the social dimension of ESG investing
(Luz et al., 2024).

Indepedent of what is the technology used, access to investing is about
financial empowerment. Ugandan investor John Ssenkeezi celebrated on X
(formerly know as Twitter) being able to vote at Apple's 2022 AGM
stockholder meeting using stock investments app Chipper Cash, which
allows users by fractional‑shares, illustrating shareholder democracy
for emerging‑market users (John Ssenkeezi, 2022). AngelList was an early
pioneer in opening startup deal flow to retail users, offering access
once reserved for angel investors and VCs. Similarly, community-based
investment clubs could potentially enable everyday investors to pool
resources and back sustainability initiatives alongside more experienced
professionals.

Build a community can be lucrative. In Singapore, Chinese influencer
Yuqing ``Irene'' Zhao's photos generated S\$7.5 million in 10 days as
NFT sales; she tokenized her selfies as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) via
IreneDAO, a decentralized version of OnlyFans, Discord, Twitch and
Patreon, arguing that Web3 empowers creators to earn directly from their
communities, turning fans into investors and aligning content creation
with tokenized membership rights --- evidence that retail capital can
flow directly to media personalities through crypto communities (Irene
Zhao, 2022; Yuqing Zhao, 2021). Similarly, in South Korea, media
personalities have become ``investable,'' through more traditional
financial vehicles, such as K-pop idols as the focus for ``thematic''
ETFs, including KPOP and Korean Entertainment ETF and the Mirae Asset
Global X K-pop and Culture ETF, enabling fans and investors to
financially participate in the growth of the Korean entertainment and
celebrity-driven cultural capital (Darwyne, 2025).

Brokers which is a mobile trading platform focused on socially conscious
investors interested in sustainability (Trahant, 2022).

\subsubsection{New Rules of Money: Legislative Efforts Empowering
Consumers to Deploy Capital in
Sustainability}\label{new-rules-of-money-legislative-efforts-empowering-consumers-to-deploy-capital-in-sustainability}

Regardless if it's money spent on shopping or money saved and invested,
these are all consumers' financial decisions of \emph{capital
allocation}. In one way or another, people are giving their money to
companies. The critical question is: \emph{do people choose to support
sustainability-focused companies} - companies which invest deeply into
green innovation and eco-friendly practices - or do people choose
companies that pay less attention to sustainability? While all financial
transactions support economic growth in the sense of being reflected in
the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), not all money flows equally support
sustainable economic growth.

Legislation is catching up with fintechs and setting higher standards
for consumer protection. For example the Directive 14 2014/65/EU, 2014
of The European Union fully recognizes the changing financial landscape
trending towards the democratization of investments: \emph{``more
investors have become active in the financial markets and are offered an
even more complex wide-ranging set of services and instruments''}
(European Parliament, 2014). Some key legislation for investors has been
put in place recently, for example ``MiFID II is a legislative framework
instituted by the European Union (EU) to regulate financial markets in
the bloc and improve protections for investors'' (Kenton, 2020). MiFID
II and MiFIR will ensure fairer, safer and more efficient markets and
facilitate greater transparency for all participants'' (European
Securities and Markets Authority, 2017).

(PWC, 2020) Changes to laws and regulations aimed at achieving climate
change mitigation is a key driver behind the wave of ESG adoption. The
goal of these laws, first adopted in the European Union, a
self-proclaimed leader in eco-friendliness, is to pressure unsustainable
companies to change towards greener practices, in fear of losing their
access to future capital, and to create a mechanism forcing entire
environmentally non-compliant business sectors to innovate towards
sustainability unless they want to suffer from financial penalties. On
the flip side of this stick and carrot fiscal strategy, ESG-compliant
companies will have incentives to access to cheaper capital and larger
investor demand from ESG-friendly investors.

Already in 2001, while still part of the EU, the UK government was
discussing ways to promote sustainable investment \emph{``fundamental
changes in VAT or corporation taxes could be used to promote greener
consumption and investment''} (House of Commons, 2002). More recently,
(HM Treasury, 2020) released a taxonomy of sustainable activities in the
UK.

While the above trend is for governments to adapt to and work towards
their environmental climate commitments and public demand, the sovereign
risk remains an issue. For example, in the U.S. the policies supported
by President Donald Trump during his presidency ran counter to many
sustainability recommendations, including those directed at the
financial markets, helping legacy industries stay competitive for longer
through subsidies, and lack of regulation, or even regulation supporting
legacy technologies (Quinson, 2020).

Governments are powerful in passing legislation, with a strong positive
or negative ESG impact, and people do have a voice. Among the many
grassroots campaigns, one environmental success story is about success
story, asking that EU shops can't sell deforestation products, gathering
over 100 thousand online signatures (WeMove Europe, 2022). Subsequently,
legislation banning products contributing to deforestation was passed by
the EU Parliament and Council in 2023 and came into effect in July 2024
(Abnett \& Abnett, 2024; European Parliament, 2023).

In the social sector of ESG, there are also stories worth sharing. For
example, during COVID-19, financial advisor Malaika Maphalala co-led the
``Invest in Black Economic Liberation'' calling for racial justice
investing to direct flows into sustainable funds (naturalinvest, 2020).

\subsubsection{ESG Crisis: Opaque Metrics and Lack of
Standardisation}\label{esg-crisis-opaque-metrics-and-lack-of-standardisation}

(Gemma Woodward, 2022) Identifies fundamental problems in current ESG
frameworks include inconsistent data and superficial rating schemes, and
calls for a complete overhaul to restore credibility in sustainable
investing. ESG Needs Standardisation of Methodologies. ``Disparity
between ESG methodologies was one of the key hurdles to finding the
right sustainable strategy'' (Margaryta Kirakosian \& Angus Foote,
2022). This is supported by econometric analysis showing how
inconsistent ESG scoring methodologies and greenwashing risk can predict
the yields of green bonds, meaning scoring variance could materially
affect bond pricing (Baldi \& Pandimiglio, 2022).

There are those rebuffing misleading claims made by asset managers.
Prominent investment research firm Morningstar conducted a forensic
analysis of the industry, and re-classified 1/5 of the tracked funds
(over 1200 in total) or over \$1 trillion USD in total valuation, as
non-ESG; Hortense Bioy, Morningstar's Head of Sustainability Research,
commented these funds don't integrate ESG factors ``in a determinative
way for their investment selection'' (Schwartzkopff \& Kishan, 2022).

In theory, Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) integrates ESG criteria
to screen out harmful industries and direct capital to companies with
positive social and environmental impacts for both ethical and financial
returns ({``Socially {Responsible Investing Advisors},''} n.d.).
Nonetheless, a large-scale input--output life-cycle assessment of 1340
European equity funds (11275 unique holdings) including sustainable
(SRI) funds, and found that 24\% of the sampled SRI funds actually show
higher total CO2 emissions exposure within their assets than a
conventional market index (Popescu et al., 2023). (Amenc et al., 2023)
reviewed ESG ratings from 3 major providers (Moody's Analytics, MSCI
Inc., and Refinitiv), finding that \emph{``well-rated companies do not
emit significantly less carbon than those with lower scores''}.

({``{ESG 浪潮反思：一間減碳表現優異、但產品有害健康的企業，符合 ESG
精神嗎？},''} 2022) critiques leading ESG rating methodologies (e.g.,
MSCI, Sustainalytics), showing they assess a company's ability to
withstand ESG-related financial risk (not its actual environmental,
social, or governance performance), allowing firms like Philip Morris,
which joined the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) in 2020 despite
selling 7 trillion cigarettes per year, to score highly, and calls for
urgent re-calibration of these frameworks.

The lack of rigor is creating a backlash against ESG reporting. (C. Yu,
2021) reports ESG is filled with greenwashing. ({``Anti-{ESG Crusade} in
{US Sweeps} 15 {States With More Laws} in {Works},''} 2023) several US
states are introducing regulation for ESG to curb greenwashing. (Frances
Schwartzkopff, 2022a) suggests the ESMA and EU has strengthened
legislation to counter ESG greenwashing. (Shashwat Mohanty, 2022)
``sustainable funds don't buy Zomato's ESG narrative''. (Bindman et al.,
2024) reports large ESG funds managed by BlackRock and Vanguard are
investing into JBS, a meat-packing company which is linked to
deforestation of the Amazon rainforest through it's supply chain.

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-48-output-1.pdf}}

(Sanjai Bhagat, 2022) argues that despite more than \$2.7 trillion in
ESG-rated AUM as of December 2021, (assets under management, the total
market value of all the investments including stocks, bonds, crypto,
etc.), that investment managers are looking after on behalf of their
clients (81\% in Europe and 13\% in U.S.), funds marketed as
`sustainable' fail to deliver improvements to environmental and social
metrics; the inconvenient truth is that ESG ratings don't deliver better
ESG performance. In the face a crisis of underperformance and mounting
scandals, (James Phillipps, 2022) questions whether ESG is fundamentally
broken or simply misunderstood. (PIETRO CECERE, 2023) calls ESG labeling
confusing and arbitrary; fund selectors describe ESG labeling as ``a
total mess,'' pointing to confusing definitions, inconsistent
methodologies, and overlapping ratings that undermine clarity.
({``Financial {Materiality Marks Next Big ESG Investing Battle},''}
2023) argues that the main challenge in credible ESG investing is
defining which sustainability factors are genuinely financially
material; the market is confused by inconsistent scoring methods and
needs more government-backed policies that create incentives to align
short- and long-term risk assessments. ESG-activist Georgia
Elliott-Smith argues in her TEDx talk that large corporations are using
ESG for greenwashing - but not changing their fundamental polluting
practices (TEDx Talks, 2022).

ESG gave banks a new tool to market and sell environmentally conscious
opportunities to institutional investors, for example: universities. A
case in point being the partnership between HSBC and the University of
Edinburgh (Reid, 2020). Some banks even use tactics such as co-branding
with famous individuals. One of the largest private banks in
Switzerland, Lombard Odier \& Co (LOIM), launched a thematic bio-economy
fund marketed using the words of The Prince of Wales, \emph{``Building a
sustainable future is, in fact, the growth story of our time''}
(Kirakosian, Noveber 16, 2020). Investment can also be advertised in
media publications. In the United Emirates, the richest oil-drilling
region in the world, Mubadala, on of the state-owned sovereign wealth
funds of the government of Abu Dhabi with \$326 billion AUM, has taken
out sponsored content in Bloomberg to market their national ESG vision
and regulatory strategies to accelerate ESG investment growth toward
net-zero goals, including many green energy projects; the Abu Dhabi
funds together manage \$1.7 trillion AUM (Maccioni, 2025; {``The
{Future} of {ESG Investing},''} n.d.).

Yet, the question remains, whether one can trust financial professional
to hold ESG to a high standard. (Agnew, 2022) Argues that ESG has become
a diluted corporate marketing label nearing the end of its usefulness,
and urges a pivot toward more substantive responsible-investment
practices beyond ticking the ESG checkbox. Banks are hiding emissions
related to capital markets, which is a major financing source for oil
and gas projects; the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials
(PCAF) working group voted to attribute only 33\% of CO2 emissions from
bond and equity underwriting to their own financed-emissions footprints,
effectively excluding and hiding 2/3 of their carbon emissions (Wilkes,
2023). In the U.S., Blackrock, the largest private investment fund in
the world with \$10T USD under management, released guidance reflecting
their plans to shift their investments to vehicles that are measured on
ESG performance; however they later backtracked from their decision
(Posner, 2024). In the U.K., while promising to become sustainable, oil
companies are increasing production; Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister of
the UK at the time announced 100 new licenses for oil drilling (Noor,
2023). In a sense this strategy could be described as ``have your cake
and eat it too'', with investing going to all types of energy,
regardless of its environmental footprint.

In early 2025, ESG investing saw \$8.6 billion in global outflows,
mainly due to political pushback in the U.S., including rollbacks of
climate and DEI policies under the Trump administration. U.S.
sustainable funds lost \$6.1 billion, and Europe saw its first net
outflow since 2018; ESG is shifting toward a more practical phase, with
less focus on branding and more on measurable outcomes (Bioy, 2025;
Johnson, 2025; Mitchell, 2025; Vosburg \& Bioy, 2025).

\subsubsection{ESG Crisis: Modern Slavery Persists and ESG Falls Short
in Protecting Workers' Rights and Mitigating Environmental
Harm}\label{esg-crisis-modern-slavery-persists-and-esg-falls-short-in-protecting-workers-rights-and-mitigating-environmental-harm}

In 2023, an estimated 50 million people were in slavery around the
world; lack of supply chain visibility hides forced labor and
exploitation of undocumented migrants in agricultural work; 71\% of
enslaved people are estimated to be women. (Borrelli et al., 2023; Kunz
et al., 2023). (Christ \& V Helliar, 2021) estimates 20 million people
are \emph{`stuck inside corporate blockchains'}. The Global Slavery
Index measures the considerable \emph{`import risk'} of having slavery
inside its imports (Walk Free, 2023). (Hans van Leeuwen, 2023) slavery
affects industries from fashion to technology, including sustainability
enablers such as solar panels. The Internaional Labor Organization (ILO)
estimates 236 billion USD are generated in illegal profits from forced
labor (International Labour Organization, 2024). On the global level,
the United Nations SDG target 8.7 targets to eliminate all forms of
slavery by 2025 however progress has been slow (The Minderoo Foundation
\& Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, 2020).

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act which came into effect
in 2012 applies to large retailers and manufacturers focused on pushing
companies to to eradicate human trafficking and slavery in their supply
chains. Similarly, the German Supply Chain Act (Gesetz über die
unternehmerischen Sorgfaltspflichten zur Vermeidung von
Menschenrechtsverletzungen in Lieferketten) enacted in 2021 requires
companies to monitor violations in their supply chains
(Bundesministerium für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung,
2023; Stretton, 2022b).

The Modern Slavery Act has been passed in several countries starting
with the U.K. in 2015, yet commodification of human beings is still
practiced worldwide (UK Parliament, 2024). (Mai et al., 2023) finds the
quality of the reporting remains low among FTSE 100 (index of highly
capitalized listings on the London Stock Exchange) companies. Not
everyone is in favor of more stringent labor practices either. Voters in
Switzerland rejected the responsible business initiative in 2020 while
the country is a global hub for trading commodities. \emph{``Switzerland
has a hand in over 50\% of the global trade in coffee and vegetable oils
like palm oil as well as 35\% of the global volume of cocoa, according
to government estimates''} (Anand Chandrasekhar \& Andreas Gefe, 2021)
begging the question can Swiss traders have more scrutiny over what they
trade.

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-49-output-1.pdf}}

Slavery is connected to environmental degradation, and climate change
(Decker Sparks et al., 2021). Enslaved people are used in environmental
crimes such as 40\% of deforestation globally. Cobalt used in
technological products is in risk of being produced under forced labor
in the D.R. Congo (Sovacool, 2021). In India and Pakistan, forced labor
in brick kiln farms is possible to capture remotely from satellite
images (Boyd et al., 2018). In effect, the need for cheap labor turns
slavery into a \emph{subsidy} keeping prices lower, and environmental
degradation happening.

While reducing slavery in the supply chain sets very low bar for ESG,
another aspect of supply tracing is the treatment of workers and working
conditions. Companies that create ``worker voice apps'', intending to to
\emph{``give the supply chain a voice''} by connecting workers directly
to the consumer (even if anonymously, to protect the workers from
retribution), include CTMFile, Alexandria, and PrimaDollar (PrimaDollar
Media, 2021; Tim Nicolle, 2021; {``Worker {Voice},''} 2022). If people
working at the factories can directly report working conditions to a
safe and anonymous tool, it could serve as a data source for further
investigation of labor issues. While there are certainly pitfalls to
this approach, one could imagine assigning each factory a social score
based on the S-band of their general ESG performance.

\subsubsection{ESG Opportunity: Environmental, Social, and Corporate
Governance Criteria Provide a Shared
Language}\label{esg-opportunity-environmental-social-and-corporate-governance-criteria-provide-a-shared-language}

Since the 1970s, international bodies, governments, and private
corporations have developed sustainability measurement metrics, the
prominent one being ESG (Environmental, Social, and Corporate
Governance) developed by the UN in 2005. This rating system has already
been implemented or is in the process of being adopted on stock markets
all over the world and has implications beyond the stock markets,
allowing analysts to measure companies' performance on the triple bottom
line: the financial, social, and environmental metrics.

In Taiwan, the Taipei stock market has listed ESG stocks since 2017 and
was hailed by Bloomberg as a regional leader in ESG reporting (Grauer,
2017). In December 2017, the \emph{FTSE4Good TIP Taiwan ESG Index} was
launched, which tracks ESG-rated companies on the Taipei stock market
(Taiwan Index, 2024). Nasdaq Nordic introduced an ESG index in 2018, and
Euronext, the largest stock market in Europe, introduced an ESG index
and a series of derivative instruments in the summer of 2020 (Euronext,
2020).

(\emph{The Importance of {ESG} Measurement and {Canada}'s Opportunity
for Improvement}, 2022) suggests ACWI ESG leaders outperform the non-ESG
screened ACWI based on comparing MSCI indexes. It's notable that ACWI
ESG starts to outperform the traditional ACWI only in the past few years
(evidence that capital markets are starting to price sustainability, but
still inconsistently). Nordic Climate Transparency Leadership analysis
of Nasdaq OMX Nordic 120 companies: \emph{``companies with higher
quality climate reporting also provide higher returns''}. In contrast,
(D. Luo, 2022) found firms with a lower ESG score are more profitable.

Rating?}\label{esg-opportunity-green-transparency---but-who-does-the-rating}

Trucost, a company launched in 2000 to calculate the hidden
environmental costs of large corporations and advance circular-economy
practices was acquired in 2016 by S\&P Dow Jones Indices, which by 2019
became a part of its ESG product offering (Indices, Oct 03, 2016, 08:30
ET; Mike Hower, Dec 9, 2015 7am EST; {``S\&{P} Rolls Out {Trucost ESG}
Data to Its Customers,''} 2019; Toffel \& Sice, 2011). It's parent
company S\&P Global also acquired RobecoSAM's ESG rating business,
consolidating S\&P's control of ESG ratings (George Geddes, 2019).

Three frameworks for corporate to think about ESG compliance is to

size, complexity and available resources of the company.

Robeco's survey of 300 large global investors totaling \$27T under

\subsubsection{ESG Success Depends on Good Governance: Boards, Policy,
and Investor
Pressure}\label{esg-success-depends-on-good-governance-boards-policy-and-investor-pressure}

Governance in ESG is the G that makes E and S happen - or put in another
way: governance drives social and environmental initiatives at
companies. Yet MSCI research finds company boards severely lacking in
climate experts; among the 164 large CO2 emitters (1986 directors in
total) benchmarked by the Climate Action 100+ alliance, 65\% have no
board member with demonstrated climate expertise, highlighting a major
governance gap (Climate Action 100+, 2023; Sommer et al., 2024).

Lack of leadership is a key challenge for sustainability. (Capgemini,
2022) \emph{``Many business leaders see sustainability as costly
obligation rather than investment in the future''} was the finding from
the Capgemini Research Institute's report ``Why sustainability ambition
is not translating to action'' surveyed 2,004 executives from 668 large
organizations; 53\% of leaders view sustainability initiatives as a
financial burden, believing the costs outweigh the benefits, and only
21\% agree that the business case for sustainability is clear,
underscoring a pervasive leadership gap that treats sustainability as a
costly obligation.

A systematic study of 153 peer-reviewed papers of ESG literature
published between 2006 and 2023 around the world reports the major
determinants of high ESG performance are board member diversity, firm
size, and CEO attributes; actively diversifying boards, especially
adding members with sustainability expertise, and aligning executive
compensation with ESG targets to translate strategic ambitions into
operational results, may boost ESG outcomes (Martiny et al., 2024).

The CEO of the Swedish clothing producer H\&M - one of the largest
fast-fashion companies in the world -, recognized the potential impact
of \emph{conscious consumers} as a threat (Hoikkala, 2019) and at the
same time launched a clothes repair service in partnership with the
Norwegian start-up Repairable, as reported by the Norwedgian
Sustainability Hub (S HUB, 2018). These kind of discrepancies are all
over the place. While Coca-Cola is the largest plastic polluter in the
world, at the same time it runs the ``World Without Waste'' program
which supports packaging recycling around the world, reporting achieving
a global 90\% recycling rate for Coca-Cola packaging (Break Free From
Plastic, 2024; Simões-Coelho et al., 2023). Large corporations such as
Coca Cola and Nestle also support the biodiversity law, calling for a
level playing field for business limit biodiversity risk (Greens EFA,
2023).

Many large businesses have tried to find solutions by launching
climate-focused funding. (Korosec, 2021) reports that Amazon's 2B USD to
a Climate Pledge Fund earmarked to fix climate problems is invested in
energy, logistics, and packaging startups, which will reduce material
waste. ``Good intentions don't work, mechanisms do,'' Amazon's founder
Bezos is quoted as saying in (Clifford, 2022). Walmart is taking a
similar approach, having launched a project in 2017 to set
CO\textsubscript{2} reduction targets in collaboration with its
suppliers (Walmart, 2023). These examples underline how money marketed
as climate funding by retail conglomerates means focus on reducing
operational cost of running their business through automation and
material savings.

Shareholders can leverage their numbers and join forces in order to
affect the board members of large corporations. For example, the As Your
Sow NGO aims to champion CSR through building coalitions of shareholders
and taking legal action, including the Fossil Free Funds initiative
which researches and rates funds' exposure to fossil fuels finance and
its sister project Invest in Your Values rates retirement plans offered
by employers (mostly US technology companies) (As You Sow, 2024a, 2024b)

\subsubsection{ESG Success Depends on Digitization and
GenAI}\label{esg-success-depends-on-digitization-and-genai}

In the U.S. and European banking sector (Dicuonzo et al., 2024)
performed an analysis of 1551 banks, of which only 180 banks disclosed
sufficient ESG data for comparison, building an Fintech Adoption Index;
the key findings included a positive correlation between Fintech Index
and ESG Scores , suggesting the adoption of technology has a
statistically significant influence on better environmental stewardship,
social and governance quality. Even larger predictors of high ESG score
were than were Board Gender Diversity (Women on Board), the Size of the
Bank, and Board Independence (governance structures with more
independent directors could be more socially and environmentally
responsible).

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-59-output-1.pdf}}

In the context of China's industrial modernization,(Lu \& Li, 2023)
finds that \emph{digitization} is the pathway to increased Environmental
Information Disclosure (EID) and Green Innovation, correlating with
increased numbers of green patents and sustainable R\&D projects.

The ability to build sustainability into the organization requires deep
understanding of how the complex structure works and what drives change
and innovation within business units. (Jim Boehm et al., 2021) distilled
key strategies from the banking sector to speed up digital
transformation, while improving risk management and compliance.

While ESG is riddled with problems, it has started a common language and
there are many ways how to improve it. The advice consultancies are
providing to banks establishes a common language and helps banks to sell
strategical alignment for long-term institutional sustainability in
terms of environmental, social, and governance performance. PWC suggests
\emph{``asset managers educate their staff and client base. `It will be
critical to build stronger ESG expertise among their employees by
up-skilling existing staff on ESG principles and strategically scout for
and integrate more diverse and ESG-trained talent'\,''} (PWC, 2020).

For AI-powered assistants to be able to provide guidance, metrics are
needed to evaluate sustainable assets, and ESG provides the current
state-of-the-art for this. The largest obstacle to eco-friendly
investing is greenwashing where companies and governments try to portray
an asset as green when in reality it's not. A personal investing
assistant can provide an interface to focus on transparency,
highlighting data sources and limitations, to help users feel in control
of their investment decisions, and potentially even provide large-scale
consumer feedback on negative practices back to the business through
infringement discovery.

In general, a futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a market
index at a fixed price on a set date, locking in today's price for the
future. The exchange's clearinghouse guarantees the trade, so one
doesn't have to worry about the other side not honoring the deal. ESG
futures specifically, are financial derivatives, standardized contracts,
which allow investors to hedge or speculate on the future performance of
ESG-compliant investments. Some ESG futures contracts include the E-mini
S\&P 500 ESG futures (on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a large
derivatives exchange), which track the U.S. S\&P 500, while skipping
companies with poor ESG scores, letting one bet on or hedge
``sustainable'' American companies with large market capitalization;
notably, the index has recently been renamed to S\&P 500 Scored \&
Screened Index, without a specific mention of the acronym ESG, while
keeping the methodology unchanged, presumably for marketing purposes in
the changing political landscape (CME Group, 2025). In Europe, the STOXX
Europe 600 ESG-X futures (on the Eurex stock market) let one trade
Europe's top ESG-screened companies, with cash settlement and the same
margin rules as regular (non-ESG) index futures (Deutsche Börse Group,
2025; Harding, 2019). Globally, the MSCI Sustainability and Climate
Change futures (on the Intercontinental Exchange) cover global and
regional ESG benchmarks, allowing one to take a position on low-carbon
or Paris Climate Agreement-aligned stock indices anywhere in the world
(Intercontinental Exchange, 2025). The CFI2Z4 Carbon Emissions Futures
tool tracks live coverage of ICE EU Allowance futures priced in EUR per
tonne, with real-time quotes as well as historical charts, enabling
traders to monitor and analyze the compliance-phase carbon market
(Investing.com, 2024). Specifically in Taiwan, the FTSE4Good TIP Taiwan
ESG futures (on TAIFEX, Taiwan Futures Exchange), launched in June 2020
to follow a basket of Taiwanese stocks that meet global ESG standards
(TAIFEX, 2025).

\subsubsection{ESG Accessibility: Curbing Corruption with Realtime Data
Streams and Product Lifecycle
Traceability}\label{esg-accessibility-curbing-corruption-with-realtime-data-streams-and-product-lifecycle-traceability}

ESG is a marketing tool but it could achieve more. One of the key
emerging issues is that ESG is an annual report not real-time,
actionable data. (Sahota, 2021) argues that ``{[}T{]}hanks to other
emerging technology like IoT sensors (to collect ESG data) and
blockchain (to track transactions), we have the infrastructure to
collect more data, particularly for machine consumption. By measuring
real-time energy usage, transportation routes, manufacturing waste, and
so forth, we have more quantifiable ways to track corporations'
environmental performance without relying purely on what they say.''

(Tim Nicolle, 2021) believ ``Real-time ESG data is more difficult to
greenwash'', ``supply chain is a significant source of ESG content''.
``But the real breakthrough is how we can surface that real-time ESG
data directly to individuals in the shops and online, linked to the
products that they are browsing and potentially buying. This means that
ESG change will finally be driven by the ultimate judge of business
success -- the customer.'' (Ratkovic, 2023).

(Kyle Wiggers, 2022) a startup called Makersite proposes instant
sustainability impact from supply chain, deep supply-chain data can
surface product--level environmental footprints in minutes instead of
months, which they call ``Product Lifecycle Intelligence''. (Makersite,
n.d.) proposes \emph{product sustainability modeling}.

Google Environmental Insights Explorer enables local governments
(cities) to measure CO2 emissions and enact environmental policies that
optimize city functions such as traffic flows (\emph{Methodology -
{Google Environmental Insights Explorer} - {Make Informed Decisions}},
n.d.; Nicole Lombardo, 2021).

For corporations respond to the climate crisis they are expected to
become more digital and data-driven. Requirements ESG compliance has
given rise to a plethora of new monitoring tools. LSEG's MarketPsych ESG
Analytics platform mines global news and social feeds for near‐real‐time
controversy alerts and ESG risk‐scores with historical data going back
to 1998 (LSEG, 2025). Envify aim to automate compliance with the
Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), by providing a
suite of carbon accounting tools(Rajan, 2025). Flowit Estonia automated
real‐time CO2e accounting in 2022 by combining invoices and sensor data
to generating instant per‐transaction emission footprints (Indrek Kald,
2022).

There's also a growing number of companies helping businesses to measure
CO2e emissions in through their entire product lifecycle. In order to
improve product \emph{provenance}, blockchains offer transparency.
Several enterprise blockchain offerings from vendor such as Hyperledger
Fabric and ConsenSys use immutable supply‐chain ledgers to record
origin, certifications, and product movements end‐to‐end ({``Blockchain
{Companies Team Up To Track ESG Data},''} 2021). Blockchain's immutable
data and programmable incentives enable transparent ESG tracking, secure
carbon‐credit registries and tokenized rewards that align corporate
behavior with climate goals (Ganu, 2021).

Supply Chain Mapping improves Transaction Traceability. What data should
be surfaced to the consumer? The founder of Sourcemap Leonardo Bonanni
started out with doing product autopsy in 2015 to assess products
(\emph{{\textless\textless{} Fast fashion \textgreater\textgreater{}}},
2023)

EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) is a success story.

Know your suppliers' suppliers (Sourcemap, 2025): ``Sourcemap's
\textbf{Supply Chain Mapping} platform (2025) offers a SaaS solution to
document and monitor every tier of a company's physical supply chain. It

integrity checks and cross-referencing with third-party registries and
watchlists. Real-time transaction traceability lets users audit all
movements and detect fraud or non-compliance instantly, while an expert
supplier-engagement team handles onboarding, training and ongoing
support to keep maps current and compliant with global due-diligence
laws''

\subsubsection{Consumer Activits are a Small
Minority}\label{consumer-activits-are-a-small-minority}

Recognition precedes protection, as the Estonian slogan goes:
\emph{``Õpetame märkama, et oskaksime hoida'' / ``Learn to notice so we
can preserve.''} (Tartu loodusmaja, 2019). (Milne et al., 2020) coins
the term \emph{mindful consumers}, who do research and are aware of the
impact of their shopping choices. Yet these types of \emph{mindful
consumers} and \emph{conscious consumers} only make up a small
percentage of the entire consumer public, which may make individual
action seem close to meaningless.

For consumer activism to become mainstream it needs to much simpler.
Sustainable options must become effortless: we need one-click tools that
turn everyday spending into votes for circular design, transparent
supply chains and mandatory climate disclosures. By setting clear
CO₂-reduction targets for products, embedding dynamic ESG-risk pricing
at point of sale, and harnessing our collective purchasing power, we can
push companies to embed sustainability at the core of business,
transforming vague ESG ideals into tangible market incentives.

There is plenty of research on if and how sustainable shopping could be
possible. Already in 2016, (Klinglmayr et al., 2016) proposed a mobile
app to channel ``political consumerism'' into sustainable shopping
through self-regulation: personalized recommendations could be provided
by aggregating vast product datasets into distilled advice, empowering
individuals follow clear sustainable-shopping rules, discover
like-minded peers, and communicate concerns directly to retailers, in
theory turning vague ESG ideals into a transparent, data-driven,
community-backed approach to sustainable consumption - however the
Horizon 2020-funded was only deployed in 2 supermarkets (Estonia and
Spain) as a pilot project. In order to understand the needed changes to
shopping, (Fuentes et al., 2019) employed a shopping-as-practice
ethnography in a Swedish zero-waste grocery store to show that removing
packaging requires reinventing the shopping practice itself,
e.g.~introducing reusable containers, new retail setups, and consumer
routines. (Weber, 2021) proposed a sustainable shopping guide in a study
which demonstrates that embedding eco-score rankings into a mobile
shopping app significantly increases consumers' selection of low-impact
food products by improving decision support and reducing information
overload. Consumer psychology is complex and (van der Wal et al., 2016)
discusses how status motives make people publicly display sustainable
behavior, revealing that shoppers purchase branded reusable bags rather
than bring their own, exposing a ``paradox of green to be seen'' and its
hidden environmental costs.

Online Shopping impact. Single's day, etc.

Double Eleven 11/11 celebrated on November 11 is the world's largest
shopping festival (時代財經, 2023). In June 2023, 526 million people
watch e-commerce live-streams in China; online bargaining is a type of
ritual (Shiyu Liu et al., 2024). According to (Igini, 2024b) ``Asia is
set to account for 50\% of the world's total online retail sales''.

It may seem impossible to turn the tide of consumerism, given the
projected growth in online shopping (Forrester, 2024)

Payments is one way consumers can take individual climate action. In the
words of a Canadian investment blogger, \emph{``every dollar you spend
or invest is a vote for the companies and their ethical and
sustainability practices''} (Fotheringham, 2017). The combination of
consumption and investment is an access point to get the consumer
thinking about investing. Even if the amount are small, they are a
starting point for a thought process.

Banks and fintechs both are skilled at capturing user data and digital
payments are an important entry point for financial services and a
source of consumer action data, shopping data. Payments is the primary
way consumers use money. Is there a funnel From Payments to Investing?
ESG Shopping is about Changing our relationship with money. Make
commerce more transparent. Current shopping is quite superficial. One
barely knows the name of the company. You don't know much about their
background. Building consumer feeling of ownership, create meaningful
connections between producers and consumers.

Digitalisation of payments creates lots of Point of Sale (PoS) data
that's valuable to understand what people buy. Banks have access to each
person's financial habits which makes it possible to model sustainable
behavior using big data analysis. Asian markets have shown the fastest
growth in the use of digital payments (McKinsey, 2020). In Macao,
contactless payments are becoming the most prevalent form of value
exchange, growing rapidly, up 40\% from the prior year ({``Contactless
Payments Prevalent in {Macau} - {City}'s de Facto Central Bank,''}
2023). In Europe, fintech is also one of the fastest-growing sectors,
with 35\% of the fintech ecosystem is made up by giants like Klarna,
Checkout.com and Revolut and 65\% belonging to new-comers; in general
describe equally strong consumer uptake and friendly regulators
(\emph{The {European} Fintechs to Watch in 2022}, 2022). With the
increasing number of financial services available, open banking
initiatives, which set standards for financial data sharing, have the
potential to improve the user experience by allowing people to access
their data across all the different banking apps they use, seamlessly
and securely, which improves the flow of the entire customer journey.

Sustainability data is an important part of the customer journey. In
Taiwan, O Bank makes use of Mastercard's data to calculate each
transaction's CO\textsubscript{2} emissions and offer Taiwanese clients
``Consumer Spending Carbon Calculator'' and ``Low-Carbon Lifestyle Debit
Card'' products (\emph{Taiwan's {O-Bank} Launches '{Consumer Spending
Carbon Calculator},' Rewards Carbon Reduction}, 2022). This is based on
technology by Mastercard, which has developed a white-label service for
sustainability reports that banks can in turn offer to their clients
(Mastercard, 2021). Similarly, Commons, formerly known as Joro, an
independent app, analyses one's personal financial data to estimate
their CO\textsubscript{2} footprint (Chant, 2022). Another example is
the Dutch fintech company Bunq offers payment cards for sustainability,
provided by MasterCard, which connects everyday payments to green
projects, such as planting trees and donations to charities within the
same user interface (Bunq, 2020). However, arguably this could be
considered greenwashing as Bunq only plants 1 tree per every €1,000
spend with a Bunq card. The example marketed at students cites \emph{8
trees planted this month} while students scarcely would have €8,000 to
spend every month.

Sharing a similar goal to Alibaba's Ant Forest, Bunq's approach creates
a new interaction dynamic in a familiar context (card payments),
enabling customers to effortlessly contribute to sustainability.
However, it lacks the level of gamification which makes Alibaba's
offering so addictive, while also not differentiating between the types
of purchases the consumer makes, in terms of the level of
eco-friendliness.

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth,height=\textheight,keepaspectratio]{./images/finance/bunq.jpg}

}

\caption{Bunq promises to combine banking and eco-friendly actions in
the same user interface - yet is this greenwashing?}

\end{figure}%

In Nigeria, (Emele Onu \& Anthony Osae-Brown, 2022) reports how in order
to promote the eNaira digital currency use, the Nigerian government
limited the amount of cash that can be withdrawn from ATMs \emph{``In
Nigeria's largely informal economy, cash outside banks represents 85\%
of currency in circulation and almost 40 million adults are without a
bank account.''} \textbf{{[}E-Naira find papers{]}}

In Kenya, M-Pesa started since 2007 for mobile payments, used by more
than 80\% of farmers (Parlasca et al., 2022; Tyce, 2020). Using digital
payments instead of cash enables a new class of experiences, in terms of
personalization, and potentially, for sustainability.

People will be more likely to save and invest if it's easy. In Sweden,
point of sales (PoS) lending is a common practice, and one of the
reasons for the success of Klarna, the Swedish banking startup, which
has managed to lend money to more consumers than ever, through this
improved user experience. Taking out loans for consumption is a
questionable personal financial strategy at best. Yet, if people can
loan money at the point of sales, why couldn't there be 180 degrees
opposite service - point of sales investing? And there is, called
``round-up apps''. (Next Generation Customer Experience, n.d.) suggests
\emph{``Targeted at millennials, Acorns is the investing app that rounds
up purchases to the nearest dollar and invests the difference.''} - and
example of From Shopping to Investing. Likewise, many banks have started
offering a service to automatically save and invest tiny amounts of
money collected from shopping expenses. Every purchase one makes
contributes a small percentage - usually rounded up to the nearest whole
number - to one's investment accounts. For example, (Swedbank, 2022),
the leading bank in the Estonian market, offers a savings service where
everyday payments made with one's debit card are rounded up to the next
Euro, and this amount is transferred to a separate savings account.
Similarly, the Estonian bank (LHV, 2020) offers micro-investing and
micro-savings services, with an interesting user experience innovation
showing how for an average Estonian means additional savings of about
400€ per year. User experience innovation can improve accessibility and
financial inclusion, while opening up a new market which used to be
underserved. For example, (Y Combinator, 2023) launched a bank inside of
Whatsapp for the underbanked gig workers in Latin America.

While the financial industry is highly digitized, plenty of banks are
still paper-oriented, running digital and offline processes
simultaneously, making them slower and less competitive, than startups.
Indeed, the new baseline for customer-facing finance is set by fintech,
taking cues from the successful mobile apps in a variety of sectors,
foregoing physical offices, and focusing on offering the best possible
online experience for a specific financial service, such as payments.

Traditional banks and fintechs are becoming more similar than ever. 39\%
of Millenials are willing to leave their bank for a better fintech
(n=4282); innovation in payments helps retention (PYMNTS, 2023). The
European Central Bank describes fintech as improving the user experience
across the board, making interactions more convenient, user-friendly,
cheaper, and faster. ``Fintech has had a more pronounced impact in the
payments market {[}\ldots{]} where the incumbents have accumulated the
most glaring shortcomings, often resulting in inefficient and overpriced
products,'' Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB says
in European Central Bank (2019).

There are also people who are concerned with digital payments. There are
concerns digital currencies also help to \emph{``democratize financial
surveillance''.} China was a money innovator introducing paper money in
the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD) ({``First Paper Money,''} n.d.). Jeff
Benson (2022) is troubled by the ``use the e-CNY network to increase
financial surveillance'' ({``Central {Bank Digital Currency} ({CBDC})
{Tracker},''} 2023) believes digital currencies make tracking easier.
Economist Eswar Prasad argues that the era of ``private''
cryptocurrencies is coming to an end down as they'll be supplanted by
government-backed central bank-issued digital currencies that marry
blockchain's efficiency with legal oversight (MARISA ADÁN GIL, 2022).
The same author compares WeChat, Alipay vs the digital yuan {[}Yahoo
Finance (2022){]}.

There are many \emph{neobanks}, or challenger banks, far too many to
list. The table only includes a small sample of banks and the landscape
is even larger if one includes the wider array of fintechs. Neo-banks
often use sustainability marketing. Legendary investor Warren Buffett's
company Berkshire Hathaway invested \$1 Billion USD in Nubank, Brazilian
digital challenger Bank, while reducing its stakes in Mastercard and
Visa, signaling growing faith in digital banking platforms over
traditional card-issuers (Andrés Engler, 2022).

Becoming a major payments player requires navigating the maze of global
directives, including legislation regarding finance, privacy, data
protection, money laundering, localized licensing regimes, and more. For
an example, Google Wallet's privacy notice sheds some light on how a
unified payments profile links services under one's Google account while
following its broader data‑use policies (Google, 2025).

Alipay is by far the largest payments super-app and provides two
investment services within it's payments platform, first launching Yu'e
Bao (餘額寶) in 2013, which automatically invests small amounts on the
users' accounts for returns typically above those of traditional banks'
saving accounts, and later in 2015 Ant Fortune (螞蟻財富), offering
access to thousands of investment products from partner companies
(KraneShares, 2020). Alibaba owns over 30\% of Alipay and both companies
are pushing for increased use of AI within their services ({``Chinese
Billionaire {Jack Ma} Sees {AI} Future for {Ant Group}, in Rare
Appearance,''} 2024).

Similary, both Line, through it's Line Pay, Line Securities, and Line
Bank, and Naver, though Naver Pay, have been on a path for several years
evolving into comprehensive financial platforms (Anna J. Park, 2023;
LINE Corporation, 2019). None of these payment apps have a specific
focus on sustainability while Alipay does have a separate
sustainability-focused service called Ant Forest for planting trees.
Payment apps created by Apple and Google are less-feature rich focusing
on payments only, and are being challenged by new-comers. An Australian
fintech Douugh released it's robo-advisor in 2024 (Paul, 2024). Douugh's
tagline explain the ethos of a unified financial app simply: \emph{``One
app to spend and grow your money''.} The newest generation of
robo-advisors are integrating large-language modules, for example
Reuters highlights the Chinese brokerage firm Tiger Brokers as one among
20 Chinese companies integrating DeepSeek deeply into asset management
from simple chat functionality all the way to executing trades.

Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) is the biggest consumer payments / financing
success story innovated by Klarna in Sweden in 2005 and Afterpay in
Australia in 2015 but with roots in Layaway Programs created during the
1930's US Great Depression (Kenton, 2023). By 2021, 44.1\% of Gen-Z in
the US had used BNPL according to (EMarketer, 2021). Users in the Gen-Z
demographic mostly use BNPL to buy clothes (LHV, 2024).

\subsubsection{The Psychology Saving: Anthropomorphism and Loyalty
Schemes}\label{the-psychology-saving-anthropomorphism-and-loyalty-schemes}

There are at least two ways to look at sustainable savings, however
related. In general, people will save nature if it also saves money.
This section looks at savings in the \emph{financial} sense of the word.
Savings in the sense of CO\textsubscript{2}e emission and environmental
cost reductions have an entire separate chapter dedicated to them titled
`\emph{sustainability}' however a short definition might be valuable
here as well.

\begin{quote}
\emph{Environmental Savings} means \emph{``the credit incurred by a
community that invests in environmental protection now instead of paying
more for corrective action in the future}'' (see Yale Center for
Environmental Law \& Policy, 2018) and (\emph{Yale, {Princeton},
{Stanford}, {MIT} and {Vanderbilt} Students Take Legal Action to Try to
Force Fossil Fuel Divestment - {The Washington Post}}, n.d., p. 33).
\end{quote}

Savings in CO\textsubscript{2}e equivalent emissions:
CO\textsubscript{2}e savings are the amount of CO\textsubscript{2}e
reduction one manages to achieve by changing one's behavior and
influencing others (people, companies). While the individual footprint
is so small, the largest reduction will come from influencing large
groups of people, either by leadership, role-model, or other means.

In theory, ethical savings accounts only finance businesses aligned with
the customers' values: screening out problematic and potentially harmful
industries such as fossil fuels, tobacco, weapons, etc; in practice, one
should carefully evaluate a bank's investment principles, environmental
policies and governance practices (\emph{Ethical {Savings}}, 2023).

Pension funds are some of the largest asset holders and choosing where
to invest one's pension can be a sustainable financial action. College
students might not have a pension fund yet, however their financial
savvy will influence their choices in the future. Savings and investing
are somewhat conflated because the large majority of savings that people
have are invested by their banks. Thus the question of \emph{sustainable
savings} comes one of where exactly are they invested and what is the
impact of that investment of sustainability. Savings are the money one
has in a pension fund or managed by themselves. For the majority of
people, savings are invested by the bank and make up the largest
proportion on investments for the people who are not active investors
themselves. However, there are cases where people manage their pensions
themselves; for example due to a law change Estonian could take out
their entire accumulated pension and invest or spend them however they
wanted (Raido Tõnisson, 2022b). While many Estonians used the money for
consumption, some people invested their retirement funds in
crypto(Marten Põllumees, 2022).

Saving precedes investing. From building loyalty to building ownership,
the first step towards investing is to start saving money. How to
encourage savings in daily life and make it a part of the everyday
payments experience? Even starting with a small step, gathering a small
target amount per month for savings, has the potential to shift the
user's way of thinking about money. The second step, choosing where to
invest these savings, will help us begin thinking like an investor. To
start noticing trends and looking into how finance shapes the world. One
experimental study showed people think about putting money in a ``safe''
place and \emph{money anthropomorphism} increased saving behavior by
18\%(L. Wang et al., 2023). Mobile money users are better at saving
(Naito et al., 2021). Nerdwallet's (Tommy Tindall, 2023) suggests making
\emph{financial commitment}s instead of resolutions, in order to
successfully save money.

Help consumers save money and business increase repeat business.
Building customer loyalty is a key part of repeat business and financial
predictability for any company. Large consumer brands like Starbucks
have for long ran successful rewards programs that encourage customers
to come back (Steinhoff \& Zondag, 2021). Could loyalty schemes create a
pathway to investing in the company to a strengthen the feeling of
connection with the business even further? After all, I'm now a minority
owner! Yet in practice, many consumers lack the financial literacy for
investing and there are many legislative difficulties for turning
loyalty points into investments. It's easier instead to create a
separate cryptocurrency or token program which users could collect and
redeem for some benefit.

Loyalty schemes can take a physical form. In Malaysia, Beebag shopping
bags made of recycled plastic bottles with a NFC ship that works in
conjunction with an app to provide rebates for customers (The Green
Factor, 2022).

\subsubsection{Sustainable Investing: Measuring the Eco-Investment
Gap}\label{sustainable-investing-measuring-the-eco-investment-gap}

By the latest estimates sustainability lacks several trillions of USD in
investment. Even with massive financing already in the pipeline, the
estimate for the global \emph{financing gap} for low-carbon energy
production was 5.2 trillion USD as of 2016 (Earth Day, 2023; {``Mapping
the {Gap},''} 2016). Ray Dalio puts the needed climate investment at
\$5T and believes these financial goals won't be met (Ray Dalio, 2023).
A newer United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) calculation
lowered the world needs an additional 4.1 Trillion USD of financing in
nature-based solutions by 2050 to meet climate change, biodiversity, and
land degradation reduction targets (UNEP, 2022).

According to (The Rockefeller Foundation, 2022) a slightly lower 2.5-3.2
Trillion USD would be sufficient.

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-63-output-1.pdf}}

What if 10\% of annual consumer spending -- \emph{ten percent is about
\$2,8T} - went towards protecting our climate. The theme for the 2023
Earth Day was \emph{``Invest In Our Planet''}.

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-64-output-1.pdf}}

The needed investment doesn't seem so large, around 5\% of the global
GDP, if one compares it to the \emph{per year} Global Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) estimated at around 100 Trillion USD in 2022 and growing
to 105 Trillion USD in 2023 (Aaron O'Neill, 2023; IMF, 2023b). In
essence, the estimated total investment gap in climate fits into the
economic growth of 1-2 years of the global economy. (OECD, 2024b)
projects steady economic growth 3.1\% in 2024 and 3.2\% in 2025 while
the (World Bank \& World Bank, 2024) is more conservative projecting
2.6\% and 2.7\% respectively.

Bad news. It would be easier for large institutional investors to move
their money to sustainable assets than for retail investors to move
their relatively small investments.

The lack of funding in green energy especially affects emerging
economies ({``Mobilizing {Capital Into Emerging Markets} and {Developing
Economies},''} 2022). \emph{``We can and must channel private capital
into nature-based solutions. This will require policy and regulatory
support, catalytic capital and financial innovation''} argued the CEO
Green Finance Institute, Dr Rhian-Mari Thomas, ahead of COP27 in Egypt
(\emph{Green {Finance Institute}}, 2023). It's not happening fast
enough.

While these assets and GDP values reflect different aspects of the
global economy, the comparison illustrates that redirecting a relatively
small fraction of global wealth and economic activity towards
sustainable investments can close the investment gap. This perspective
should inspire confidence that the goal is achievable with coordinated
effort and policy support.

\subsubsection{Retail Investing Enables Financial Inclusion and Growing
Money
Sustainably}\label{retail-investing-enables-financial-inclusion-and-growing-money-sustainably}

\emph{Retail investing} can be seen as a form of financial inclusion.
Ant Group's CEO Eric Jing remarked in (Turrin, 2021): \emph{``The
financial system of the past 200 years was designed for the industrial
era and served only 20\% of the population and organizations. As we
enter the digital age, we must better serve the remaining 80\%''.}

Many ecologically-focused funds with different approaches have been
launched in recent years, with variations in asset mix and style of
management; thematic asset management is expected to grow, with
investors packaging opportunities based on consumer trends (Doorn,
2020). Among retail investors, there's some appetite for sustainability
however investors are not sure how to separate sustainable assets from
less sustainable ones (S. Ho, 2019). While literature has been debating
if it's possible to \emph{``do well while doing good''}, latest research
suggests it's possible to make investments that both make an attractive
financial return and adhere to sustainability goals (Y.-M. Tan et al.,
2023). ``sustainable investing is now part of mainstream financial
strategy'' (Morgan Stanley, 2019).

(T. Smith, 2019) suggests 74\% of Chinese youth are looking for
``positive impact'' and (Lingeswaran, 2019) suggest philanthropy is on
the rise in Asia in general. (M. Li et al., 2022) suggests retail
``investor attention can significantly improve enterprises' green
innovation level''.

Sweden is a country with highly developed financial markets and active
social campaigns demanding sustainability as well as well as the home
for several green fintech companies, including Doconomy and Trine
({``Meet the Fintechs Leading {Sweden}'s Green Revolution,''} 2021).
(Lagerkvist et al., 2020) undertook a choice experiment ``Preferences
for sustainable and responsible equity funds'' with 559 Swedish private
investors In Sweden, and found that sustainability strategies and an
environmental focus carry more weight than fees, past performance or
fund size.

(BlackRock, 2022) notes some ESG-oriented hedge funds can be ``highly
engaged with management teams'' in order to influence management towards
ESG practices in said companies. Barclays' 2021 investor survey found
hedge‑fund LPs (limited partners) adding screening for ESG data and
willingness to start new ``green alpha'' funds if performance can be
proven by robust data (\emph{{ESG} Hedge Funds {\textbar} {Barclays
Corporate} \& {Investment Bank}}, 2021). High quality data is the key to
unlocking this potential. ESG Analytics founder Qayyum Rajan introduces
a sentiment‑driven, alternative‑data platform that maps real‑time ESG
events to SASB topics for deeper, faster screening (Qayyum Rajan, 2021).
In addition to finance being increasingly data-driven, it's also
increasingly personalized, for example Vise showcases its AI‑powered
portfolio‑builder that lets RIAs customise, manage and explain client
portfolios at scale, pitching itself as the ``Copilot for wealth
managers'', allowing creation of highly personalised portfolios
(\emph{Vise}, 2023). RavenPack provides an analysis tool tracking media
and sentiment to gauge capital flows driven by ESG (RavenPack, 2021).

Companies themselves need to better understand their emissions, giving
birth to the industry of climate accounting. The myclimate NGO is among
the many providers or detailed calculate climate cost calculators,
consulting and verified carbon‑offset projects aimed at helping firms
net‑zero targets (\emph{Myclimate -- Your Partner for Climate
Protection}, 2023).

Institutional finance is highly linked and constantly learning from
each-other. For example, The Network for Greening the Financial System
(NGFS) is a coalition of over 140 central banks that publishes
scenarios, best‑practice guides and policy papers on climate‑related
financial risk (\textbf{NGFS2023?}). In Thailand, the Thai Fintech
Association site lists its ecosystem map, events and membership tiers
aimed at fostering fintech innovation and regulatory dialogue in
Thailand ({``Thai {Fintech Association} ({TFA}),''} n.d.). Online news
platforms such as ({``Green {Central Banking},''} n.d.) aggregate
research and daily news on how central banks integrate climate
risk---scorecards, policy trackers and expert commentary.

\subsubsection{Investable Asset Classes for Retail Investors: Increasing
Exposure to Stocks, Bonds, Commodities, Real-Estate, Digital Tokens and
Alternatives, Lending, Futures, Hedge Funds, Private Equity, and even
Venture
Capital}\label{investable-asset-classes-for-retail-investors-increasing-exposure-to-stocks-bonds-commodities-real-estate-digital-tokens-and-alternatives-lending-futures-hedge-funds-private-equity-and-even-venture-capital}

There are many asset classes with varying degree of access to a retail
investors. The main categories of investment products are, based on the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission categorization (U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission, 2025).

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}l@{}}

\midrule\noalign{}
\endhead
\bottomrule\noalign{}
\endlastfoot
Stocks \\
Bonds \\
Mutual Funds \\
ETFs \\
Insurance Products such as Variable Annuities \\
\end{longtable}

There are also newer asset classes.

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-66-output-1.pdf}}

\emph{Stocks} are the most popular assets class with a long history and
highly accessible to retail investor, albeit usually at the cost of a
trading fee. \emph{Meme stocks} are another aspect of the
\emph{entertainmenization} of investing. There are many groups of
Twitter, Reddit, and elsewhere, where investing trends start, causing
more volatility. Retail investing apps blend entertainment into the
UX/UI of investing. For example stock-trading app Robinhood uses
game-like features such as displaying a confetti animation to create a
sense of excitement around trading investing. Retail investing UI/UX is
simplified and gamified, which encourage impulsive short-term buying and
selling with a focus on speculation over fundamentals and cause FOMO
(fear of missing out).

\emph{Bonds} are a form of debt investment also known as an fixed-income
asset where the principal is repaid at the maturation date of the bond
(usually in years) with an added premium. Individuals can't emit bonds
but they can invest in them. It can be a way to invest locally in one's
own city - or globally. For individuals, there's access to some green
bond exposure through ETFs (exchange-traded funds) available on retail
investing apps. Access is not universal and availability depends on the
geography of the user and local legislation; for example Revolut, the
most downloaded finance app in the EU, only enabled bond investing for
European customers in summer 2024 (Revolut, 2024c, 2024a). Investing in
bonds is a form of \emph{Passive Investing} and allows investors focus
on low-risk passive income instead of daily stock investing most popular
on Robinhood and Revolut - albeit with much less potential for returns.

\emph{Lending} is an attractive assets class with a significant social
impacts providing opportunities to small farmers and other participants
in the money markets while offering the lender a return, all possible
through online apps and platforms. Retail investors can lend small
amounts of money (also known as MicroLending) on peer-to-peer (P2P)
lending platforms such as Twino. These loans and pooled and the risk is
borne in aggregate as a form of risk-management.

\emph{Hedge funds} generally are not accessible to retail investors,
requiring a substantial minimum investment. However some Hedge Fund
based ETFs (exchange-traded funds) and Mutual Funds with Hedge Fund
Strategies may try to mimic hedge funds, investing in the same
underlying assets. While hedge funds used to be available for
professional investors, online platforms such as (Hedge, 2023) aim to
provide retail investors a social investing experience to ``make a hedge
fund with your friends'', where people can come together and pool their
funds in ``mini‑fund'', with social tools such as chat and voting on
trades built-in, aiming to democratize the hedge‑fund model for small
retail groups. It's how many people in the world of venture capital
invest, investing together, or after a lead investor, who they trust. An
early entrant into the market, (Renato Capelj, February 16, 2021 6:47
PM) positions Titan as a ``mobile hedge‑fund'' app, which is actively
managed, with transparent fees, and a competitor to automated
robo‑advisors.

\emph{Commodities} are increasingly investable, with retail investors
can now buy cold and silver as well as rare metals on financial
platforms such as Revolut. Democratization of commodity trading lowers
the barriers and allows individuals to diversify their portfolios beyond
equities and bonds.

\emph{Real-estate} is increasingly available on co-investing platforms
allowing retail investors access into this asset class with a relatively
low starting price. Thus investing in sustainable architecture can be an
attractive proposal both from an environmental as from a financial
standpoint, potentally providing a passive income stream in the form of
rent. According to (Debnath et al., 2022) 39\% of global
CO\textsubscript{2} emissions comes from the building sector.
Construction is large emitter because of the use of concrete; super tall
buildings are very CO\textsubscript{2} intensive (Zhao \& Qin, 2015).
Building emissions can be reduced by using sustainable design and
materials, \emph{digital twins} of architecture enable pre-visualization
of different designs (Panaro et al., 2024) as well modeling the usage of
the building, for example the interior shop floors in commercial
real-estate (Jia et al., 2023). In housing development, there's evidence
of `green' buildings achieving a `higher financial return than
conventional buildings, both in terms of rent and sale price' (Oyedokun,
2017).

\emph{Venture capital} largely remains inaccesible for retail investors,
and not only for its high capital requirements; groups like the
Investment Company Institute (ICI) pushing to increase retail access to
private markets are criticized for exposing retail investors to
increased risk (Langton, 2025). While value investors love rules-based
screens such as the Piotroski F-score, used to identify stocks that have
strong fundamentals, these measures break down for high-growth startups
whose financials are distorted by deliberate burn
(\textbf{ratesgurungPiotroskiScoreDefinition2025?}).

``Green Bonds, Sustainable Equities, ESG-focused Mutual Funds and ETFs,
Impact Investing (through platforms), Renewable Energy Infrastructure
(via ETFs or mutual funds), Sustainable Real Estate (through REITs or
ETFs), Social Bonds, Carbon Credits (via ETFs or specialized funds),
Sustainable Commodities (via ETFs or funds), Community Investing
(through CDFIs or crowdfunding platforms), Sustainable Infrastructure
Funds (available as ETFs or mutual funds), Environmental, Social, and
Governance (ESG) Metrics Integration (through broad ESG-focused ETFs or
funds)''

\emph{Thematic Capital} refers to choosing a clear investing thesis
around a topic and building a resilient strategy. For example, for
ESG-themed investments might pick Green Bonds, Sustainable Equities, and
ESG‑focused Mutual Funds and ETFs as the core, each screened through ESG
metrics integration to ensure material impact rather than superficial
marketing however although there is a wide range of investment products
marketed as sustainable, many are fake, so rigorous due‑diligence is
essential to weed out greenwashing and align holdings with authentic
sustainability outcomes. Just like there are ``green shops'' for buy
everyday products, there are also green investing platforms for
purchasing various types of investment products that have been rated on
some type of sustainability metric, for example green ETFs, green bonds,
and the like. All of these are essentially forms of green branding,
designed to make it easier for investors to find an investing product
they trust.

There are many investment platforms self-describe as green, but the
questions remains, who to trust.

that prioritize energy efficiency and low‑carbon construction. Social
Bonds expand the opportunity set by financing healthcare, education, and
affordable housing, while Carbon Credits (via ETFs or specialized funds)
and Sustainable Commodities (via ETFs or funds) offer exposure to
emissions‑reduction markets and responsibly sourced raw materials,
respectively. For deeper community impact, one might allocate some funds
to crowdfunding and crowd-loan platforms and to Sustainable
Infrastructure Funds (available as ETFs, bonds, and mutual funds) that
upgrade transport, water, and grid systems for a low‑carbon future. In
short, disciplined selection across various investment vehicles
increasingly available to retail investors, guided by a robust investing
thesis and aide by monitoring tools, in theory, would enable one to
align financial performance with genuine social and environmental
progress while avoiding the pitfalls of superficially labeled products.

\subsubsection{Green and Sustainability-Linked
Bonds}\label{green-and-sustainability-linked-bonds}

\emph{Green bonds} are released by companies, international
organizations, and cities to raise money for green transformation,
usually for building something to improve sustainability, tied to
specific projects. There's a growing global trend in green bond
emission, with 257 Billion USD worth of green bonds issued in 2019,
expected to reach 1 Trillion USD annually by 2030 (MacAskill et al.,
2021). That prediction was too low with 870 Billion USD green bond
emissions reached already in 2023; currently Europe is the largest
emitter of green bonds (Climate Bonds, 2023). China has the 2nd largest
green bond market in the world and it's growing fast; buyers are looking
for green bond certification to reduce yield spread, meaning the price
of the green bond is becoming more similar to the price of a `regular'
bond (Q. Li et al., 2022; W. Peng \& Xiong, 2022). The Climate Bonds
Initiative, which is working on greening the entire short-term debt
(bond) market, puts the size of the entire market at \$55 trillion,
underlining the relative percentage of green bonds is tiny ({``Climate
{Bonds Initiative} Calls for Greening of \$55trn Short-Term Debt
Market,''} 2022).

In 2017 the Malmö city in Sweden released green bonds to finance a
sustainable transition of the city (City of Malmö, 2017). An independent
analysis found bonds may not be emitted for financial reasons but to
improve the reputation and city image, lower interest rate (aptly named
\emph{greenium}) with a similar in returns to traditional bonds - and
have their share of challenges, namely being difficult to certify,
monitor, report and measure impact of (Sjöström et al., 2020).

Making sure a green bond is truly supporting sustainability is a
challenge. For example, Aramco, the Saudi Arabian public petroleum and
natural gas company faced scrutiny for what critics deemed as `Fake
green bonds' (Anthropocene Fixed Income Institute (AFII), 2022). Green
bonds can also be emitted on blockchains with the stated goal of
improving transparency. Hong Kong multi-currency green bond on the
blockchain. The issuer (Hong Kong government) hopes to reduce
greenwashing (Hall, 2024; Kitano, 2024). In the EU as well, there are
emerging tools for monitoring green bonds on blockchain (Christodoulou
et al., 2023). (Qin et al., 2023) finds evidence that the combination of
green bonds and blockchains are an enabler carbon neutrality in China.
The World Bank successfully raised 110 Million USD in Australia in
2018-19 and has since doubled the amount in a new 220 Million USD
emission in Switzerland using bonds on a blockchain ledger for
SDG-related projects (World Bank, 2018, 2019, 2024).

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-67-output-1.pdf}}

\emph{Sustainability-Linked Bonds} are less stringent than green bonds;
they are not tied to specific projects but more broad sustainability
targets (Priscila Azevedo Rocha et al., 2022): ``Sustainability-linked
bonds let companies borrow cheaply if they meet environmental, social,
and governance targets. A Bloomberg News analysis found those goals are
weak''. (Priscila Azevedo Rocha et al., 2022) suggests \emph{``So far,
most ESG investing is in the stock market. But the the \$22 trillion
corporate bond market, where mature global companies such as Chanel go
to borrow money from investors, has a particularly powerful role to
play. Companies rely on debt much more than they do on stocks.''}

\subsubsection{Fusion of Traditional Finance and Decentralized Finance
(DeFi)}\label{fusion-of-traditional-finance-and-decentralized-finance-defi}

Crypto-assets and digital tokens (known as decentralized finance or
DeFi) are a highly accessible yet risky asset class, offering investment
opportunities to anyone with a mobile phone and internet access. The low
entry barrier makes crypto among the most potentially inclusive forms of
investment, though bearing significant risks, as well as regulatory
challenges. Cryptocurrencies are popular among young people yet in many
ways crypto needs even more financial literacy than traditional
financial assets. Crypto investing removes most entry barriers while
having high risk.

(\textbf{statistaCryptocurrenciesWorldwideStatista2024?}) estimates over
860 million cryptocurrency users worldwide by 2025, just shying away
from 1 Billion users. A Brazilian study (N=573) found ``Crypto investors
in Brazil are generally younger, male, and exhibit higher risk tolerance
compared to non-crypto investors.'' Colombo \& Yarovaya (2024)
``Brazil's planned adoption of CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency).''
``It finds that risk tolerance, economic pessimism, and a belief in
better investment acumen are significant predictors of crypto
investment.''

The large number of crypto users begs the question: what would investing
look like at the scale of 1 Billion people? The most popular use cases
for crypto have been NFTs, online smart contracts attached to some type
of asset, typically a picture. Social media is even bigger, with over 2
Billion users, so it's not difficult to image the combination of Social
+ Crypto (NFTs?) to become the largest retails investing revolution,
albeit a risky one, with many users losing their assets. This is the
vision behind Sandbox, a Metaverse cryptocurrency sold by banks such as
LHV in Estonia (Raido Tõnisson, 2022a).

Taiwan has an active market for crypto-assets while with some
limitations. In 2022, the Taiwan government banned buying
cryptocurrencies with credit card quoting the volatility makes it
similar to gambling (David Attlee, 2022; 廣編企劃, 2022). In January
2022, BlockTempo and OpenSea teamed up to mint the ``Top Taiwan
Influencers'' collection---21 unique, limited-edition Taiwanese digital
influencers as NFTs, depicting Taiwan's leading blockchain figures,
designed to honor their industry contributions in digital art (OpenSea,
2022).

In general, crypto ownership can be divided into self-custody (you own
the keys to your wallet) and custodial ownership, where you trust
someone else (i.e.~a centralized exchange or a bank) to hold the
cryptocurrency for you. Both have their risks (self-custody, losing your
keys; custodial: the exchange steals your tokens or goes bankrupt).
Centralized crypto exchanges are in essence loaning assets from the
user. \emph{``The piece of the settlement aimed at getting important
information to customers is more understandable from a retail protection
standpoint. Customers who lend crypto assets to a company in exchange
for a promised return should get the information they need to assess the
risks against the rewards''} (Hester M. Peirce, 2022).

There's also a large trend of fusion of decentralized finance (DeFi) and
traditional finance (TradFi), with the largest established investors,
such as BlackRock, launching tokenized funds (Matos, 2024; Sandor, 2024;
Securitize, 2024). Tokenization is similar financial securitization
which has been happening for a long time, with blockchains creating new
tools for securitization: for example art can be securitized and
tokenized (Masterworks, 2023). Blockchains makes this kind of financial
engineering easier as any developer can do it; one does not need to be a
bank.

In Switzerland, institutional funds entered crypto early. Licensed
already in 2019 by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority
(FINMA), AMINA, formerly known as SEBA Bank, was among the first
regulated cryptocurrency banks (AMINA Bank AG, 2023). The first crypto
fund was launched in September 2021, when FINMA approved Switzerland's
first regulated crypto-asset fund---the ``Crypto Market Index Fund''
from the same AMINA bank, giving investors access to a FINMA-supervised
vehicle that tracks a diversified basket of blockchain-based assets with
the AMINA Bank's custody (FINMA, 2021). AMINA of course was not the only
bank interested in crypto, with ``{[}m{]}ore than half'' of Swiss banks
planning to offer digital assets services in the near future
(swissinfo.ch/urs, 2022). Banks launching Crypto ETFs (Exchange Traded
Funds) enable their clients to have exposure to crypto without ever
buying cryptocurrencies directly themselves. However, while owning
cryptocurrency directly allows one to use crypto tools to look at any
wallet balance, ETFs hide that transparency.

To put it very simply (knowingly oversimplifying), in traditional
finance legislation is an enabler of corruption as in the case of Swiss
privacy laws, where illegal funds can be hidden, while in
cryptocurrencies, the lack of clear and comprehensive regulation is an
enabler of corruption.

Pricing crypto is not based on any single fundamental metric, but comes
from tokenomics: a catch-all word for token design and internal
economics, such as supply schedules, emissions cuts, burns and staking
yields to frame the basic scarcity curve as well as demand side
narratives, and real world utility and user sentiment. Crypto enables
significant potential for financial engineering and innovation by anyone
with enough programming skills.

Bitcoin is by far the most popular cryptocurrency with it's high price
volatility creating opportunities for high gains and high losses. While
bitcoin has been called a ``digital gold'' for store of value, its
volatility characteristics are very different from gold, as seen on this
chart.

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-68-output-1.pdf}}

The volatility of the markets has notably shifted crypto research
towards pricing theories. However volatility is relative. Volatile
national currencies lead people to find other assets to hold. If your
national currency is collapsing, you might find crypto has a relative
safe haven to keep your funds. People like Turkey losing 75\% of the
value of their assets when currency collapses, why people buy crypto.

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-69-output-1.pdf}}

For example, in X research an index of major sustainability news was
compared with crypto prices, which may have negative, positive, or no
correlation with the following cryptocurrencies.

\subsubsection{Regenerative Finance (ReFi) and
DAOs}\label{regenerative-finance-refi-and-daos}

\begin{quote}
\emph{``Would you rather buy a DogeCoin or a regenerative food forest
token?''} Curve Labs founder Pat Rawson quotes Shiller (2019) in ReFi
podcast about Kolektivo (ReFi DAO, 2022).
\end{quote}

(Caio Jobim, 2022) believes Bitcoin has failed as a mainstream money but
blockchain technology in general will underpin the next-generation
digital-currency systems, ultimately replacing both cryptocurrencies and
cash. While Bitcoin uses proof-of-work, and protocol which is highly
energy intensive (and thus, unsustainable), later innovations such as
proof-of-stake enabled the creation of blockchains, which are
energy-efficient; an overview from 2023 details 23 low-carbon
blockchains (Alzoubi \& Mishra, 2023). (Sepandar Kamvar, 2022) Sepandar
Kamvar, co-founder of Celo, famously calls ``{[}a{]} blockchain is a
database without a database admin''. (dGen \& PositiveBlockchain, 2021)
built a positive blockchain database of blockchain for good projects.
Some traditional green investors have started to take note. (Marquis,
2021) reports on RSF Social Finance's shifting from impact investing to
regenerative finance, detailing its \$230 million under management and
community-pricing innovations.

Inspired by the decentralized finance (DeFi) Summer of 2020, when
projects like Compound, Yearn, and Uniswap demonstrated blockchain-based
financial tools could go viral, followed by COVID-19, which exposed
systemic fragility and served as a a wake-up call about global
interconnectedness and ecological risk, crypto pioneers attempted to use
their native tools for public good, instead of only financial goals,
giving birth to the regenerative Finance (ReFi) movement, applying
technology to carbon accounting, market development, and governance (B.
Smith, 2021). Innovating on the intersection of blockchains,
tokenization, nature-backed assets, and cryptocurrencies, ReFi leveraged
DeFi to create financial systems that aimed to restore ecosystems and
empower communities by prioritizing positive environmental and social
impact ({``What Is {ReFi} {\textbar} {Regenerative Finance}
Explained,''} 2023).

Founded already in 2018, Regen Network built a blockchain for ecological
data and carbon credits, using the Cosmos blockchain SDK (Regen Network,
22 C.E., 2023). Another early example is the Celo proof-of-stake
blockchain, founded in 2020, which offsets carbon emissions at the
protocol level, automatically investing a small percentage of each
transaction into a reserve, which buys green assets, such as tokenized
carbon credits (e.g.~Moss MCO₂), laying the groundwork for a
regenerative financial system ({``Celo and {Regenerative Finance} -
{Climate} and {ReFi},''} 2021). ({``Planet of the {Klimates} - {Luis
Adaime} - {Founder} \& {CEO} of {MOSS}.{Earth},''} n.d.) details the
issuance and tokenization of tropical-forest carbon credits (Moss.Earth
MCO₂) and biodiversity tokens within the Celo ecosystem. Similarly, the
({``{KlimaDAO},''} 2023b) KlimaDAO protocol, founded in 2021, tokenizes
real-world carbon assets into liquid Klima tokens, establishing a
DAO-governed, transparent market for carbon neutrality, which has \$4
billion in total transaction volume.

Social features has always been a weakness of Web3, and (Syndicate,
2022) contends that it's not enough to build decentralized financial
rails to democratize wealth creation; crypto investing must also
redesign the social networks around capital. The Web3-based attempt to
achieve these goals is called DAO or Decentralised Autonomous
Organizations, which allow wallet holders to collaborate and vote on
issues. (BlockChannel, 2017) defines a DAO as a Decentralized Autonomous
Organization on blockchain, using smart contracts and token-weighted
voting to enable permissionless, community-driven governance. In the
world of Web3 and cryptocurrencies, smart contracts make it possible for
DAOs to also pool member resources for investing. Because of the
on-chain nature where transactions are visible to anyone, they may be
seen as more transparent. DAOs an be used in a similar way to Hedge
funds; a DAO can have a treasury, with a shared multi-sign wallet
(similar to a bank account) from which investments can be made together.
Typically DAOs have a voting system to make decision while Hedge Funds
may be more centrally controlled. A notable example, (Carra Wu \& Chris
Dixon, 2021) details how the Friends With Benefits (FWB) DAO transformed
consumers into investors by requiring an application review and token
buy-in, granting members governance rights and meaningful ownership in a
token-gated community. With a specific sustainability focus, ({``Trees
for the {Future},''} 2023) DAOs to enable concerted action towards
climate goals using the pooled resources in a treasury, a blockchain
(on-chain), similar to how hedge funds work.

(Ian Bezek, 2021) argues that DAOs and governance tokens could replace
stock exchanges and corporations by using programmable blockchains for
digital ownership and control of assets registered in on-chain
distributed databases. (Nathan Reiff, 2023) explains how DAOs use smart
contracts and cryptographic voting to manage organizations without a
central authority; some advantages include transparency and community
ownership, while existing challenges of being in a legal gray zones (one
still needs to register a legal entity) and risks of security hacks, are
real. (Rehash: A Web3 Podcast, 2022) insists that people and not just
code must be the north star in Web3 design frameworks to achieve a truly
human-centered Web3. Yet, the first wave of Web3 users were
privacy-conscious and wouldn't answer questions, making it challenging
to create good personas, making design difficult (Crabb, 2023). While
somewhat out of date, (Ray, 2023)~offers a comprehensive review mapping
the Web3 technology landscape which serves as a good introduction.
Finally, ({``Empowering {Digital Asset Banking},''} n.d.) notes it's not
only retail investor entering the crypto world, large institutions are
doing the same, with tokenisation, crypto custody and asset‑management
increasingly becoming a part of mainstream finance.

(Aikman, 2022) proposes using a DAO called OpenESG to cut opacity and
greenwashing, with a Decentralized Expert Council and Community Voting
to build transparent rating methodologies, while validator bounties
would incentivize crowdsourcing and verification of data, making every
scoring step is auditable; high scorers could gain direct access to
sustainable financing, turning ESG excellence into tangible regenerative
outcomes. While the ideas remain, the OpenESG organization itself has
defunct for unknown reasons, leaving one to wonder if these ideas are
workable.

A lot of financial tooling from traditional finance (called trad-fi in
crypto circles) has been replicated using blockchains and related
technologies. However, the legislation affecting Hedge Funds and DAOs
would be different as hedge funds are an older and more established
financial tool whereas DAOs still fall in somewhat of a gray area. For
example, in the U.S.a federal judge ruled that crypto collectives
(crypto investment clubs) like Lido DAO are general partnerships liable
for unregistered securities offerings (\emph{Investment {Clubs} and
{Collectives} {\textbar} {Deprecation FAQ}}, n.d.). In order to overcome
these legal hurdles, VC-backed startups have launched platforms to
support a new generation of DAOs, providing regulatory navigation and
smart-contract tooling that broaden blockchain dependencies beyond DeFi
protocols (Lucas Matney, 2022).

Oracles provide the intersection between finance and real world
sustainability data. A data oracle is the concept of a source of
real-world data which can be ingested through an application programming
interface (API) to a blockchain system. There are many databases of
sustainability information which could serve as an oracle for carbon
labeling, packaging, transportation, consumption, and waste. For
example, crypto crop insurance provided by IBISA Network uses blockchain
triggers and satellite data to offer transparent, automated payouts for
farmers facing weather-related risks (\emph{{IBISA Network} --
{Enabling} the {Next Generation} of {Insurance} for {Agriculture}},
n.d.). While (Caldarelli et al., 2020) notes it's a challenge to ensure
the accuracy and trustworthiness of real-world data from Oracles, the
largest Oracle provider ChainLink founder Sergey Nazarov believes the
collaboration of oracles and blockchains can make carbon credits more
trustworthy. (Brady Dale, 2021; Chainlink, 2022).

\subsubsection{Divestment: Supporting Sustainability by Avoiding the
Worst Polluting
Companies}\label{divestment-supporting-sustainability-by-avoiding-the-worst-polluting-companies}

Divesting is the inverse of investing. If no sustainable alternative can
be found, at least taking one's money out from polluting companies
signals one's green preferences. ``Sustainable development requires more
investment in sustainable companies and less in unsustainable firms.''
(Van Zanten \& Rein, 2023). In institutional finance, the Norwegian
\$1.3T USD sovereign wealth fund (the world's largest) started a
divestment trend in 2016 by divesting first from coal following by
divesting from oil, gas and coal extracting companies (Ben Martin, 2017;
Holger, 2019). Their plan to reach net zero CO2e nonetheless only
targets 2050. Furthermore, who would be the counterpart for such large
transactions. The fund also announced divesting from Russia after its
invasion of Ukraine, however has yet to sell any shares citing lack of
buyers on the Moscow stock market. Even with divesting from oil and has,
Norway Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG) still adheres to the
Markowitz's Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), with enough diversification
between assets (Papaioannou \& Rentsendorj, 2015).

University of California also followed suit with divestment of its
\$126B USD portfolio from oil and gas. Other large university
endowments, such as managed by Yale, Stanford and MIT are in decision
gridlock.

While divesting makes news headlines, even divestment by large
institutional investors, such as the Norwegian National Pension Fund
(GPFG), has a negligible effect on the heavy polluters' business; by the
same logic, it can be deducted, the financial effect of retail investors
divesting, is meaningless. If retail investors act in aggregate, the
reputational effect needs further research. \emph{``To halt climate
change, some investors have decided to divest from fossil fuel
companies. Reviewing the literature suggests that divestment from fossil
fuel has limited financial consequences; it slightly increases divested
firms' risk and their cost of capital, while reducing divested firms'
market value,''} is the pessimistic conclusion by (Plantinga \&
Scholtens, 2024).

By extension, it may sound feasible that divesting could have a
meaningful impact on companies if a large numbers of retail investors
collaborate on `banning' the company to send a message to the board, yet
in practice small individual divestments may be neglible to governance
decisions.

\subsection{The Economics of Decoupling: Attempts to Disconnect Economic
Growth from
Eco-Degradation}\label{the-economics-of-decoupling-attempts-to-disconnect-economic-growth-from-eco-degradation}

Is the ``eco'' in ecology and economy the same? Oîkos, the Greek word
for ``household'', seeds two modern disciplines: ecology studies how the
home works; economy sets the rules for managing it. The two have drifted
apart: one guarding planetary health, the other chasing growth. This
chapter reunites them by asking: how do we measure prosperity without
wrecking our home?

\subsubsection{Post-AI Economics}\label{post-ai-economics}

People around the world are discussing how traditional economics can
adjust to the abundance provided by AI, known as \emph{Post-AI,
Post-Labor, or even Post-Scarcity economics}. Last year, the Seoul AI
Summit pushed for voluntary safety standards to manage systemic risks
while the French AI Summit tackled energy consumption and environmental
costs, highlighting the need to embed AI sustainability into economic
planning, regulatory frameworks, and corporate accountability (Hern,
2024; Milmo, 2024). More recently, the Anthropic Economic Index tried to
capture how AI impacts human work and economics in general, noting that
among millions of work tasks submitted to Claude - studied as anonymized
conversations using a privacy-preserving clustering tool Clio,
separately described in (Tamkin et al., 2024) -, that 43\% of the work
could be categorized as automation and 57\% as augmentation of human
economic activities (Handa et al., 2025). At the same time, economists'
predictions of the future impact of AI are far from uniform, for
instance MIT economist Daron Acemoglu estimating that in the U.S. only
5\% of the tasks can be profitably automated and AI will only contribute
a modest 1.1\% to the GDP until 2035 (Acemoglu, 2024).

\subsubsection{Econometrics: The Many Ways to Measure an
Economy}\label{econometrics-the-many-ways-to-measure-an-economy}

\emph{Econometrics} is the science of measuring the economy.

\begin{quote}
The creator of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) metric in 1934 Simon
Kuznets said: ``The welfare of a nation can scarcely be inferred from a
measurement of national income as defined by GDP\ldots Goals for `more'
growth should specify of what and for what'' (United States. Bureau of
Foreign and Domestic Commerce et al., 1934).
\end{quote}

GDP was the culmination of previous work by many authors, beginning with
William Petty in the 17th century (Rockoff, 2020). This long journey
underlines how a metric about a complex system such as the economy is
continuous work in progress. There has been ongoing work to create
improved metrics such as the the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),
Human Development Index (HDI), Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), Green
GDP, Inclusive Wealth Index, and others (Anielski, 2001; Bleys \&
Whitby, 2015; Kovacic \& Giampietro, 2015).

Measuring wellbeing in addition to GDP and the metric should including
resiliency dashboards, to to visualize metrics beyond GDP and they are
an integral part of country reports (GreensEFA, 2023). Similarly, the
doughnut (donut) economics (more below) model calls for a
\emph{``dashboard of indicators''} (TED, 2018).

The National Academies links public health outcomes (air quality, water
safety, and food systems) with sustainability actions, calling for an
integrated cross‐sector strategy to protect community well‐being
(\emph{Public {Health Linkages} with {Sustainability}}, 2013).(Guidotti,
2015) argues environmental quality foundational to public health and
urges embedding sustainability principles across healthcare systems and
policies; in order to have healthy communities, we need clean air, pure
water, and toxin‐free surroundings.

\subsubsection{The Evolution of Economic
Metrics}\label{the-evolution-of-economic-metrics}

Traditionally, the true cost of products is hidden. The work is hidden.
The first two decades of the 21st century have seen increasing economic
thinking, looking to challenge, improve and upgrade capitalism to match
our current environmental, social, and technological situation, often
called \emph{New Economics.} Some of these include behavioral economics,
sustainable capitalism, regenerative capitalism, doughnut economics,
ecological economics, blue economy, degrowth, attention economy, gift
economy, intent economy, among others. There's no lack of published
books on changing capitalism, which goes to show there's readership for
these ideas. Build a new economic theory is out of scope for my thesis
design, however I'll focus on the parts of economic theory I believe are
relevant for \emph{interaction design}-ing for sustainability.

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-70-output-1.pdf}}

There are those looking for \emph{new metrics}. One of the first
innovators, already in 1972, was Buthan, with the \emph{Gross National
Happiness Index (GNH)}, which in turn inspired the UN, decades later, in
2012, to create the International Wellbeing and Happiness Conference and
the International Happiness Day(Kamei et al., 2021; Ribeiro \& Lemos
Marinho, 2017). The World Bank talks about the comprehensive GDD+
metrics in its Changing the Wealth of Nations report (World Bank, 2021).

The Wellbeing Economy Alliance (WEAll) countries (New Zealand, Iceland,
Finland, Scotland, Wales) as well as the EU and Canada, started the
coalition in 2018 looking to involve more broad-based metrics in
developing their societies(CEPR, 2022; David Suzuki Foundation, 2021;
Ellsmoor, 2019; Scottish Government, 2022; Wellbeing Economy Alliance,
2022).

Giacalone et al. (2022) looks at wellbeing of Italian communities and
proposes a new composite index.

There's work ongoing on macroeconomic modeling, aiming to create a
\emph{digital twin} of the economy. Some of the most complex computer
models of the economy include the Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal
Model (GIMF) (Laxton et al., 2010) and DSGE (Dynamic stochastic general
equilibrium).

\subsubsection{Hidden Costs: Pricing
Externalities}\label{hidden-costs-pricing-externalities}

Markets misprice ``home maintenance.''

Co-founder of Generation Capital with 50 Billion under management David
Blood ``the most sifinifcat thing we can do as capital allocators is to
price in those difficult to price externalities'' Liebreich (2025)

In the simplest sense, prices do not capture all costs. ``Consumption,
production, and investment decisions of individuals, households, and
firms often affect people not directly involved in the transactions''
(Helbling, 2012). Externalities as an economic concept was implied by
Alfred Marshall, one of the founders of neoclassical economics, in his
1890 treatise ``Principles of Economics,'' and further developed by
Arthur Cecil Pigou in his 1920 book ``The Economics of Welfare''
(Marshall, 1997; Pigou, 2002). As of 2023, the value of unpriced
externalities which are not included in the GDP is 7.3 trillion USD per
year (Trucost \& TEEB for Business Coalition, 2023). The award-winning
economist Mariana Mazzucato argues in (A. H. Gupta, 2020) we should
include more into how we value unpaid labor, relating to the social (S
in ESG) (Mazzucato, 2018) as part of our metrics.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Financialization}}{Financialization}}\label{financialization}

(Yüksel et al., 2023) criticizes excessive financialization where the
real economy and financial markets disconnected, blaming it for the the
2008 economic crisis, proposing a new index for \emph{participation
finance} aiming to ground the financial economy in the real economy;
rooted in Islamic banking, participation finance avoids highly
speculative activities, which are seen as exploitative, looking to
promote stability, transparency, and fairness.

\subsubsection{Ecological Economics Builds Upon Classical
Economics}\label{ecological-economics-builds-upon-classical-economics}

While Adam Smith is most famous for his concept of the \emph{invisible
hand} first appearing in \emph{The Theory of Moral Sentiments} (1759)
and further developed in his seminal work \emph{The Wealth of Nations},
published in 1776, his writings also highlight the interdependence of
economic actors, who through specialization increase productivity, but
also increasingly dependent on each another as well as the role of
empathy in individual actions (Atal et al., 2024).

Ecological economics doesn't necessarily argue with the foundation of
classical economics, rather ecological economics finds the classical
economics model and by extension neoclassical economics are
\emph{incomplete,} ignoring the physical limits of natural resources.
Ecological economics draws attention to the interdependence of economy
and the ecosystem; there are physical limits to economic growth on a
planet with finite resources.

The biggest point of contention is the necessity of \emph{economic
growth}. The founder of ecological economics Herman Daly was talking
about \emph{prosperity without growth} more than two decades ago,
focusing on the diminishing natural resources (Daly, 1997). Daly was
teaching economics to undergraduates at Louisina State University when
he grew dissatisfied with the standard model of the market, which didn't
include any inputs (resources) or outputs (pollution), and later modeled
his work by placing the economy \emph{within} the larger system of the
ecosphere (Ketcham, 2023). More recently.(Jackson, 2009, 2017) have
expanded on these ideas with recipes for a \emph{post-growth} world,
making the ideas seem more tangible and precise, yet mostly untested in
the real world.

Writing in 1973, E. F. Schumacher argued economics overlooks both
natural resource depletion and environmental degradation and draws on
religion (particularly Buddhism) to suggest a simpler way of life:

\begin{quote}
\emph{``Simplicity and non-violence are obviously closely related. The
optimal pattern of consumption, producing a high degree of human
satisfaction by means of a relatively low rate of consumption, allows
people to live without great pressure and strain and to fulfil the
primary injunction of Buddhist teaching: `Cease to do evil; try to do
good.'\,''} (Schumacher, 1985)
\end{quote}

New economic thinkers are asking how can economic growth and
sustainability be compatible. Some even ask if \emph{economic growth}
itself is the wrong goal? (Diduch, 2020). Lewis Hyde's book ``The Gift''
argues creativity thrives in ``gift economies''; reciprocity is more
important for creativity than market exchanges (Hyde, 2006).

Degrowth is the most famous contender in that branch of economics. Is
Decoupling Economic Growth and CO2e Emissions Possible? Is Green Growth
an oxymoron? No-one knows as it hasn't been done before. Degrowth
proponents are pessimistic it's possible to decouple greenhouse gas
emissions from economic growth; historical data shows does not show any
decoupling (Vadén et al., 2020).

The original Ramsey model introduced by Frank P. Ramsey in 1928,
becoming foundational for traditional economic growth theory, does not
assume infinite economic growth (Attanasio, 2015). (Marc Germain, 2016)
has adopted the Ramsey Model and introduced constraints such as
pollution, distinguishing renewable and non-renewable capital.

(Jackson, 2017) limits to growth update shows that absolute decoupling
of GDP growth from environmental impact at the speed needed for climate
targets is effectively impossible; prosperity should be redefined around
wellbeing, sufficiency and resilience rather than perpetual economic
expansion.

\subsubsection{Doughnut Economics and Regenerative
Capitalism}\label{doughnut-economics-and-regenerative-capitalism}

\emph{Doughnut Economics}, introduced in the eponymous book uses a
simple visualization of a doughnut (donut in American English) to help
us grasp the big picture of the economy \emph{embedded} inside the
physical and social worlds (Raworth, 2017). Raworth calls to move beyond
GDP growth, building economies that are regenerative and distributive by
design, fitting human needs within planetary limits (De Balie, 2018).
The Doughnut Economics model allows one to see the social shortfall and
ecological overshoot of nations at the same time (A. L. Fanning et al.,
2021). The doughnut concept is simple and deep at the same time, a
useful as social object to enable starting conversations with people
from all walks of life, independent of their politics leanings. As
Raworth calls it, it's a \emph{``self-portrait of humanity in the
beginning of the 21st century''\textbf{.}} Combining the \emph{SDGs
(Sustainable Development Goals)} inside the doughnut and the
\emph{Planetary Boundaries} (Earth's ecological ceiling) outside the
doughnut, leaves a space inside the donut represents a state of
equilibrium and balance on spaceship Earth.

In some ways this Doughnut Economics can be described as a movement.
Doughnut Action Labs enable local communities to build local donuts
customized to local problems. While the ideas have not yet been
implemented on a country-level, smaller scale doughnut economics'
success stories have inspired cities to take a comprehensive view of the
doughnut of their own city with several EU cities adopting the vision
(Jordan G. Teicher, 2021). While critics say doughnut economics would
expand the role of the government (Horwitz, 2017), doughnut
practitioners in Brussels believe everything can be adapted to the place
and context (BrusselsDonut, 2022; Oikos Denktank, 2021).

The city of Amsterdam is developing shorter food chains (which save
CO\textsubscript{2e}) and linking residents with food production and
reconnecting people to the food which foster collaboration in the
community (Circle Economy, 2021). Amsterdam has also built comprehensive
dashboards called the Circular Economy Monitor which makes it easy for
anyone to see the progress being made towards the Dutch goal to be a
circular economy by 2050 (Gemeente Amsterdam, 2022; Ministerie van
Infrastructuur en Waterstaat, 2019).

\emph{In his 2015 paper Regenerative Capitalism}, John Fullerton, an
investor and a capital markets and derivatives expert, builds his
economic theory on the ideas of Club of Rome and the Limits to Growth
(Meadows \& Club of Rome, 1972) as well as taking inspiration from R.
Buckminster Fuller.

\begin{quote}
\emph{``Nature is a totally efficient, self-regenerating system. If we
discover the laws that govern this system and live synergistically
within them, sustainability will follow and humankind will be a
success.''} (Fuller, 1983)
\end{quote}

``{[}H{]}uman civilization is embedded in the biosphere,'' Fullerton's
ideas aim to balance efficiency with resiliency so the whole system
doesn't become brittle and break (Confino, 2015; John Fullerton, 2011,
2022). While regenerative capitalism recognizes the need for economic
growth it also deems ``{[}t{]}he quality of growth matters''
({``Regenerative Capitalism,''} 2023). For example, he cites the example
of Triodos Bank which already in the 1980s focused on sustainable
banking championing responsibility, transparency, and business ethics. A
member of the Global Alliance for Banking on Values, Triodos finances
projects in nature preservation and restoration (GABV, 2023).

\subsubsection{Decarbonization
Scenarios}\label{decarbonization-scenarios}

The possibility of decoupling economic growth from CO\textsubscript{2}e
emissions (also known as decarbonizing the economy or eco-economic
decoupling) or is hotly debated (pun intended) among scientists. (Keyßer
\& Lenzen, 2021) provides several scenarios for low, medium, and high
levels of decoupling titled Degrowth, IPCC, and Dec-Extreme.

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-71-output-1.pdf}}

Looking a the United Kingdom, (harrisson, 2019) concludes UK's
CO\textsubscript{2e} emissions have fallen 43\% from 1990 to 2017
through the use of less carbon-intensive energy sources and argues for
moderate policies in (Hausfather \& Peters, 2020).

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-72-output-1.pdf}}

Meanwhile the cumulative CO\textsubscript{2e} emissions trend in the UK
in the same time-frame show the historic responsibility of UK (Global
Carbon Budget, 2023).

CO2e emissions and GDP growth per capita follow a similar path in the
BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) as well as
in Vietnam and Somalia (Raihan et al., 2024; Viana Espinosa De Oliveira
\& Moutinho, 2022; Warsame et al., 2024).

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-73-output-1.pdf}}

\subsubsection{Reducing the Gap Between Climate Science and Climate
Economics}\label{reducing-the-gap-between-climate-science-and-climate-economics}

William Nordhaus won a Nobel Prize in 2018 for attempting to combine
climate change and economics in a single, integrated assessment model,
named \emph{Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy (DICE)}, however his
predictions are considered inaccurate by climate scientists,
underestimating the risk of catastrophic warming, tippings points, and
the probability of higher temperatures leading to mass death (Jones \&
Steffen, 2019; Kemp et al., 2022; Ketcham, 2023; Stern et al., 2022;
Stern, 2022a; Y. Xu \& Ramanathan, 2017).

Energy and climate change economist Noah Kaufman says economists don't
understand climate and climate scientists don't understand economics;
and calls out economic calculations which try to estimate climate
damages over hundreds of years or find a price for climate equilibrium,
as nonsensical (dessler2, 2024). Instead, in a recent paper, co-written
with another Nobel prize-winning economist, Joseph Stiglitz, they argue
economics can solve climate change though a risk-management approach for
policy support, focusing on lowering climate risk by achieving net-zero
carbon emissions (Stiglitz et al., 2024).

While Nordhaus has been criticized for his numbers, the general idea of
his early book titled ``The Climate Casino'' doesn't disagree. Nordhaus
himself likens the current trajectory of climate change to humanity
entering a ``climate casino,'' where we're is gambling with the planet's
future (Nordhaus, 2013). Written a decade later, Nordhaus asks if we can
still exit the casino, and is much more pessimistic than in his early
work (Institute of International and European Affairs (IIEA), 2023).

Although over 100 different scientific journals now publish work on
sustainability economics, the field remains highly fragmented, with
little interaction between research clusters. A bibliometric study of
1987--2013 publications found 11 largely self‑contained research
clusters, with minimal cross‑citation; for example the Nordhaus‑style
integrated‑assessment‑modeling literature had almost no overlap with
another prominent researcher, Elinor Ostrom, whose work focuses on
commons governance within sustainability economics (Drupp et al., 2020).

Kaufman decries the lack of real-world data in the economic-climate
models, and believes the simple assumptions should be replaced with much
more complex scientific analysis (dessler2, 2024).

(T.-P. Wang \& Teng, 2022) conducted a systematic comparison of 3
leading integrated assessment models (IAMs) to quantify climate change
damages globally and for China specifically, valued as percentage of
GDP; the models are as follows FUND (Framework for Uncertainty,
Negotiation and Distribution), RICE (Regional Integrated model of
Climate and the Economy) and PAGE (Policy Analysis of the Greenhouse
Effect)

\subsection{Efforts to Curb Greenwashing: Data-Driven Benchmarks and the
Fight for
Transparency}\label{efforts-to-curb-greenwashing-data-driven-benchmarks-and-the-fight-for-transparency}

Sustainable Investing is Based on Data. Greenwashing is a large
detractor from environmental action as it's difficult to know what is
sustainable and what is not. Greenwashing Disturbs Sustainable Capital
Allocation. Greenwashing erodes trust. Greenwashing has a negative
Impact on Credibility. The promise of ESG is to counter misinformation
with transparency. Environmental Information Disclosure (EID). Marketing
- Sustainability Marketing. Countering Misinformation with Transparency.

Corporate hypocrisy is an important blocker of sustainable action. Both
the European Commission and the Chair of U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) Gary Gensler have called for more legislation to curb
business greenwashing practices. \emph{``If it's easy to tell if milk is
fat-free by just looking at the nutrition label, it might be time to
make it easier to tell if''green'' or ``sustainable'' funds are really
what they say they are''} says Gensler (US Securities and Exchange
Commission, 2022). EU regulation for standardizing sustainability
reporting is called the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive
(CSRD) entered into force in 2023 and is being gradually ramped up until
2027.

Green investing only makes sense if it's possible to distinguish
sustainable investments from not sustainable ones. Humans feel as if
choosing green is useless and give up. Sustainabile investing is firstly
about changes in legislation which set stricter sustainability standards
on companies (as discussed above). Secondly, increased transparency, new
metrics, and new tools make it feasible to differentiate more
sustainable companies from less sustainable ones.

Upcoming EU greenwashing legislation hopes to curb misleading
communications by companies. \emph{``Make benchmark methodologies more
transparent when it comes to ESG \& put forward standards for the
methodology of low-carbon and ESG benchmarks in EU''} (European
Commission, 2019b). EU's Ecodesign Regulation for Sustainable Products
(ESPR) requires mandatory documentation of environmental impacts for all
product categories, bans self-declared green claims by, and sets out
specific design criteria, including durability, reparability, recycled
content, remanufacturing, lifecycle impacts, and waste prevention
(Nastaraan Vadoodi, 2022). Until new legislation is ramped up to shift
from linear to circular product development, building consumer awareness
is crucial as currently most emission-reduction programs are voluntary
and thus affected only by consumer demand (André \& Valenciano-Salazar,
2022). Greenwashing is widespread in company social media communications
(Geoffrey Supran, 2022). A number of new AI-based tools aim to find
instances of greenwashing. ClimateBert AI finds rampant greenwashing
(Bingler et al., 2021; Sahota, 2021).

While the EU has proposed legislation to curb greenwashing, EU climate
policy itself has been criticized for greenwashing. Sometimes
greenwashing comes under legislative protection Kira Taylor (2021).
(Booth, 2022) describes how ``A recent investigation shows illegal
logging of protected areas in eastern European countries that supplies
residential wood pellets in Italy. Belgium, Denmark, and the Netherlands
are importing pellets from Estonia, where protected areas are logged for
pellets and the country has lost its forest carbon sink, despite
large-scale wood pellet plants being certified `sustainable' by the
Sustainable Biomass Program''.

In recycling systems,(Purkiss et al., 2022) highlights the confusion
between compostable and biodegradable plastics and public
misunderstanding what happens to these plastics when they reach the
landfill: ``{[}m{]}ost plastics marketed as''home compostable'' don't
actually work, with as much as 60\% failing to disintegrate after six
months''. Shopping bags marketed as \emph{biodegradable} don't show
deterioration after 3 years in salt-water sea environment (Napper \&
Thompson, 2019).

\subsubsection{Anti-Greenwashing Efforts in
Taiwan}\label{anti-greenwashing-efforts-in-taiwan}

The Taiwanese Financial Supervisory Commission, the Ministry of
Environment, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications, and the Ministry of the Interior
collaborated on the \emph{``Reference Guidelines for the Identification
of Sustainable Economic Activities'' to encourage the financial industry
to assist enterprises in their transition to sustainable carbon
reduction''} (金管會 \& Financial Supervisory Commission, 2022)

The Taiwanese Corporate Governance Sustainable Development Roadmap
published by the Corporate Governance Reform Task Force established by
the Executive Yuan (Taiwanese Government), identifies \emph{lack of
diversity and independence in boards} and \emph{insufficient ESG and
financial information transparency} as key issues (Taiwan Stock Exchange
Corporation, 2023).

The Taiwanese Green Citizens Action Alliance published a comprehensive
report in 2024 tracking Taiwanese Corporate Sustainability Reporting
focused directly at fighting corporate greenwashing (綠色公民行動聯盟,
2024).

\subsubsection{Product Databases as a Precursor for Traceability and
Supply Chain
Mapping}\label{product-databases-as-a-precursor-for-traceability-and-supply-chain-mapping}

In order to consider the sustainability on a product level, there should
be a directory of all the world's products - a world product database.
GS1 is the organization responsible for issuing EAN/UPC barcodes found
on most consumer products worldwide (GS1, n.d.). However, while the UPC
stands for Universal Product Code, there is no truly centralized,
authoritative database of all UPCs, which has led to duplication and
inconsistency across products sharing the same codes, especially with
the rise of e-commerce marketplaces (Semantics3, 2017). As early as
2016, (Håkon Bogen, 2016) raised questions whether a global database of
all EAN (European Article Number) barcoded products could be created.
Barcodes help identify products within supply chains and retail systems,
but they do not alone create a central product registry. On a basic
level, standardized product codes ensures product inventory,
traceability, automated checkout, and support global trade. All of the
world's products already are subject to one or another standard and
although they are not uniform, some documentation does exist about every
product.

A number of specialized product databases have been created to fill
specific needs. The Open Product Database maintained by Datakick
(\emph{Datakick}, n.d.) aimed to crowdsource product information but
faced limitations and is no longer widely active. WIPO GREEN, the global
green technology database, catalogs environmentally sustainable
innovations (\emph{{WIPO GREEN}}, n.d.). The World Packaging Database
provides detailed information about product packaging worldwide,
important for understanding material impacts ({``Packaging {World},''}
n.d.).

In a similar vein, Konrad (n.d.) imagines the possibility of an
internet-wide directory of purchasable products, akin to how platforms
like Spotify have made nearly all of the world's music easily searchable
and accessible. However, despite the obvious need, attempts to build
such directories have faced significant challenges. For example, the
Open Knowledge Foundation's Open Product Data initiative ({``Open
{Product Data}''} (n.d.)) was eventually shut down, highlighting how
difficult it is to maintain open, comprehensive, and up-to-date product
information at a global scale.

While some infrastructure exists, including bar and QR-codes, standards,
and partial databases, the world still lacks a unified, reliable,
open-access product database. Building such a system could be improve
sustainability assessments, supply chain transparency, and informed
consumer choices at the global scale.

\subsubsection{Indices, Certifications and Sustainability Standards
Enable Product
Comparisons}\label{indices-certifications-and-sustainability-standards-enable-product-comparisons}

Research shows certification does matter. In Europe, consumers are
willing to pay more for bio-based products \emph{``72\% of Europeans are
willing to pay more for environmentally friendly products. The study
identifies a''green premium'' and a ``certified green premium,''
indicating increased WTP for bio-based and certified bio-based
products''} (Morone et al., 2021). Particulary in Italy, a study of
consumer awareness of sustainable supply chains shows Italian consumers
have a strong preference for antibiotic-free meat (Mazzocchi et al.,
2022).

Open ESG data platform Wikirate currently lists 4316 different metrics,
essentially questions which companies should answer (Wikirate, 2025).

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{_thesis_files/figure-pdf/cell-74-output-1.pdf}}

Companies assess customer's credit score to decide credit-worthiness,
however inversely, how can customers rate companies? Indices make
comparing companies possible. There are many-many indexes, scoring
systems, ratings, certifications, etc. Most sustainable companies. Make
a database?

Sustainability indices need transparency and standardization (Bolognesi
et al., 2024).

Based on Corporate Knights data (Corporate Knights, 2024)

Energy productivity and carbon productivity are a measure how intensive
the product is per unit of productivity.

There are many standards. (International Trade Centre, 2022) currently
lists 334 different sustainability standards: ``Towards a meaningful
economy'' ``The world's largest database for sustainability standards'',
``We provide free, accessible, comprehensive, verified and transparent
information on over 300 standards for environmental protection, worker
and labor rights, economic development, quality and food safety, as well
as business ethics.''

At the 2023 Scottish AI Summit, practitioners demoed how AI pipelines
can analyze modern slavery statements to flag missing disclosures,
suggesting how humans and machines can ``scale corporate
accountability'' like never before (Laureen van Breen et al., 2023).
Meanwhile, WikiRate's Facility Checker uncovers living-wage gaps in real
time for advocacy organizations (Wikirate, 2022a)

Certified B Corporations undergo a rigorous B Impact Assessment (only
those scoring 80 or above can earn the B Corp seal) and adhere to strict
sustainability practices, which gives as placement in the B Lab global
directory. Stakeholders can explore B Corps by country and industry,
complete with verified impact scores and performance details. This
digital platform is used by over 150 thousand businesses to manage their
ESG performance (B Corp, 2025).

Maintaining that trust matters. In 2017, Etsy lost the certification
after failing to convert a public company into a public benefit company
for fear of shareholder reaction (Alba, 2017; Silverman, 2017). Instead,
Etsy launched a campaign to focus on transparency, called ``Made
Mistakes'', publicly sharing user-experience errors to build trust
({``Etsy Made Mistakes, but Its Commitment to Social Responsibility
Wasn't One of Them,''} 2017).

Citywealth's ``ESG branding with B-Corps'' guide shows how companies can
leverage their B Corp status---using consistent logo placement,
stakeholder storytelling, and transparent impact data to avoid
greenwashing and attract impact-focused investors (Citywealth, 2021).
({``Social {Enterprises}, {B Corps}, {Benefit Companies}, {ESG},''}
2025) explains how the true social and financial value of mission-driven
enterprises comes from aligning the documentation with the reality.

\subsection{Navigating Complexity with Data: Probabilistic Risk-Based
Assessment of
Sustainability}\label{navigating-complexity-with-data-probabilistic-risk-based-assessment-of-sustainability}

Sustainability is a complex web of interconnections. To treat nature as
commodity is a category mistake: it's impossible to bring back already
destroyed biodiversity which took millennia to develop. Humans create
hugely complex systems using technology, instead of simply conserving
nature.

``Companies in industries with the biggest carbon footprints aren't
reporting how their emissions feed into financial risk, according to an
analysis of corporate reports by the Carbon Tracker Initiative.''
(Frances Schwartzkopff, 2022b)

BeZero is innovating in the voluntary carbon credit market (VCM) by
providing risk-scoring, a language financial professionals are
accustomed with (BeZero, 2022b; \emph{Navigating {Net Zero} with
{Co-founder} of {BeZero Carbon},} 2023)

``Automate your carbon accounting. Make data-driven decisions, across
your entire supply chain.'' Ratings for mines CarbonChain (n.d.)

Efforts to connect carbon markets, carbonmark.com

``We believe that markets for ecosystem assets need to scale urgently,
starting with carbon markets. The challenge is to make these instruments
as recognizable as tradeable assets, as measurable as financial
securities, and as investable as other asset classes. Capital must flow
into the environment at scale to deliver climate action.'' ``Efficient
financial markets allocate and manage risk based on effective price
mechanisms, and this relies on access to credible information.'' BeZero
(2022b)

``Everyone in the market is struggling to effectively price and manage
risk.. the Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM); a rapidly recovering market,
forecasted to grow by as much as 100x, but constrained by a nascent
market structure.'' ``The BCR is a carbon-only expected return model. It
utilises a risk-based approach and seeks to give everyone a common
language of risk. One that is translatable to that used by the \$200
trillion of assets in global financial markets.'' BeZero (2022a)

I adopted a face-to-face method to increase response rates distributing
flyers to students on college campuses, canteens, and classrooms getting
verbal permission from educators in their ´ classrooms to distribute the
survey flyer. The flyer included a colorful AI-generated visual with a
futuristic game-link female figure, the title ``climate anxiety
survey'', a website link (ziran.tw) and scannable QR-code.

Similarly to (C.-H. Liu et al., 2023) I distributed the survey in
schools in the Northern, Soutern, Central, and East regions of Taiwan.

The survey only included questions and descriptions in Chinese. I have
used the Claude 3 Opus model to translate them to English for this

\subsection{Research Design}\label{research-design}

When developing my research design, I relied on the advice of (Christian
Rohrer, 2022) to decide when to choose which User-Experience Research
methods.s

\textbf{The research design of this study consists of 3 steps.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Qualitative research targeted at financial and interaction design
  experts, leading to a \emph{wish list} of features.
\item
  Survey potential users' preferences, including a choice experiment of
  the proposed features.
\item
  Design a prototype of the personal sustainable finance AI assistant,
  tested using qualitative methods in a focus group.
\item
  This mixed-method research design is divided into three stages
  (fig.~11).
\item
  My purpose for the first qualitative stage is to explore the general
  themes arising from the literature review related to the design of AI
  advisors for investing. I will identify specific user experience
  factors, through interviewing experts in financial technology and user
  experience design and reviewing existing applications on the
  marketplace. At this stage in the research, the central concept being
  studied is defined generally as expectations towards a sustainable
  investment AI advisor.
\item
  I will then proceed to the second, quantitative stage, informed by the
  previously identified factors, and prepare a survey, including a
  Likert scale, and a choice experiment, focusing on the preferences of
  the potential users in generation-z aged 18-29, living in Taiwan (see
  fig.~12 on next page), exploring the relationship between independent
  variables: - ``Interest in Sustainability'' - ``Interest in
  Investing'' - ``Preferred Features'' - and the dependent variable
  ``User Sign-ups''.
\item
  In the third stage, I will return to the qualitative methods, by
  building a prototype of the sustainable investing AI companion, taking
  into account insights gathered in the previous stage. I will use a
  focus group to discuss the prototype, and conduct a thematic analysis
  of the discussions' recordings, leading to further validation of
  previously gathered data and possible changes in the prototype. The
  gained insights, accompanied by the app prototype, which embodies my
  findings, will be the final outcome of my research.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conceptual Framework}\label{conceptual-framework}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The conceptual framework map presents the key concepts arising from
  the literature review thus far in the research process. I'm using
  these concepts when developing interview strategies for phase one of
  the research, developing the survey questionnaire for phase two, as
  well as for building the Personal Sustainable AI Financial Advisor
  (PSAA) for young adults at the final stage of the process. However, I
  expect the conceptual framework to further evolve with additional
  findings while conducting my research.

Conceptual Model

\subsection{Research Methods}\label{research-methods}

\subsubsection{Phase One - Qualitative
Research}\label{phase-one---qualitative-research}

The qualitative research methods employed in the first stage of the
research design enables me to explore concepts arising for literature
review further, using a more open approach, without limiting the
conversation only to pre-ascribed notions. The strength of the
qualitative approach in the first stage is to encourage the discovery of
new ideas, not yet common in literature and potential user experience
factors related to sustainable investing and user experience.

\paragraph{Sampling}\label{sampling}

My qualitative sampling structure uses non-probability snowball
sampling, with the following criteria: financial industry, fintech, and
design experts everywhere, including in Taiwan and Sweden, but also
Estonia, Portugal, and elsewhere.

\textbf{Method:} Semi-Structured Interviews

I will conduct exploratory research in English using semi-structured
interviews recorded online and offline.

\subsubsection{Phase Two - Quantitative
Research}\label{phase-two---quantitative-research}

The strength of quantitative research is to enable me to access a larger
sample of potential users in two countries, using online survey methods,
and to validate some of the qualitative findings from stage one.

\textbf{Sampling} My quantitative sampling structure uses a judgmental
criterion: adults aged in Generation-Z (18-29), located in Taiwan,
surveyed using a Chinese-language online survey.

\textbf{Method:} Likert The survey includes a Likert scale between 1 to
5 to validate key findings from the first stage of the research by
assessing responses to statements regarding the app's design, features,
and other criteria that may still emerge.

\textbf{Method:} Choice Experiment The survey includes a choice
experiment between different sets of potential features available when
communicating with the sustainable finance AI companion.

\subsubsection{Phase Three - Qualitative
Research}\label{phase-three---qualitative-research}

In the last phase, I will return to the qualitative methods to further
validate the quantitative findings from stage two. Here my focus will be
on operationalizing the gathered insights into a prototype that users
can experiment with and discuss with their peers in a focus group
setting. Sampling

The phase three sampling structure uses a judgmental criterion: - age
18-35 - located in Taiwan - Using the Chinese language for discussion

Individual face-to-face interviews with be organized at universities
around Taiwan. Because in-person presence is required in this stage, the
prototype will only be tested by potential users physically present in
Taiwan. To avoid convenience sampling, I will post online ads in Chinese
and reach out to varied student clubs to invite people who I don't know
personally, to participate in a ``sustainable AI application testing''
(wording may change).

\textbf{Method:} Focus Group The strength of a focus group is the
ability to observe potential users in a social setting, where knowledge
can be exchanged between the participants. The whole experience,
including emerging conversations, will be recorded and transcribed.

\textbf{Method:} Thematic Analysis Finally, I will perform a thematic
analysis of the focus group transcriptions in order to validate previous
findings, and open avenues for future research.

In-Person Face-to-Face Testing

I conducted in-person testing individually with 32 students at 7
universities. Interviews were conducted in Chinese and transcribed and
translated to English using Google Voice to Text AI as well as Describe
AI. Face-to-face testing was concluded in several universities across
Taiwan.

\section{Results}\label{results}

For high ESG, Governance, Board Diversity, Board Experts on Climate, and
Fintech Adoption (Digitalisation) matter. These are the main predictors
of high ESG performance and should be highlighted to the users who wish
to buy sustainable products.s

Expected Findings

During the preparation of this research proposal I conducted a
preliminary round of facetoface interviews using 21 openended probing
questions using a convenience sampling of NCKU students on campus
between ages 19 and 29 a total of 12 respondents The interviews lasted
between 9 and 21 minutes and were conducted to get some initial feedback
on my research idea the respondents daily routines app usage feelings
towards financial questions including investing relationship with nature
and environmental sustainability These preliminary conversations led me
to emphasize more on the financial journey ie to consider the importance
of the shopping savings and payments apps students already use daily
which could serve as an entry point to becoming an investor I expect my
future research findings to confirm this initial idea and offer diverse
ways and examples of what that path could look like in practice

Customer segmentation

Personas are created using K-means clustering, an unsupervised machine
learning algorithm, which clusters college students based on their
responses across 36 Likert-scale fields in the online survey. Clusters
are visualized using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), where the
principal component loadings on the X and Y axes represent the weights
of the original Likert-scale fields, transformed into the principal
components that capture the most variance.

K-prototypes combines K-mean and K-modes unsupervised machine learning
algorithms.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  There is some similarity between clusters. All 3 personas report a
  high level of financial anxiety and below-average satisfaction with
  their financial literacy.
\item
  Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to convert data to lower
  dimension space. This is a predecessor of embeddings.

\item
  thinks ``goodonyou.eco'' looks like a brand website
\end{itemize}

may3 - first looked for NET clothes but Momo doesn't sell it - Looked
for Sony camera lens

1 may prof suggestion - make connection between biodibersity and
production and consumption clearer - what is the incentive for companies
to share their data?

my own idea: like the switch of going from traditional banking with ATM
machines on the street (or even the physica bank office) to online
banking with mobile payments

hypothesis: esg accessibility can push companies to increase production
standards

what if you can see ESG in near-realtime such as the stock market price

i can imagine esg derivative product like siemens gamesa

ai can help integrate esg derivatives into daily life to drive esg
adoption

``effective altruism (EA)''

``Blockchain technology can improve price transparency in product
distribution by allowing consumers to know the exact pricing from raw
materials to distributors to suppliers.''

Interviews and testing survey were conducted anonymously in hopes to
have more honest responses from the responders.

ziran chrome extension is unable to record activity due to browser
security restrictions for plugins

ai.ziran.tw record user activity

semi-structured interviews were conducted in chinese

the interviewer (me) took notes of the interviews

some gaps in the data exist due to the limited chinese language skills
of the interviewer (me)

basic interview script - momo: what is a brand that you like'd or would
like to buy - search - please pick a product (or search again) - on
product page: what do you notice on this page? - what kind of
information is important for you on this page? - do you notice anything
else - (if the user doesn't notice the green filter, direct their
attention to it and ask: what do you think this does?) - would you click
on it - if the user says yes, continue - if thhe user says no, make note
and continue - as the extension generates a response: what do you think
about this content? - is there any information that you consider
important? - anything else you see that you think looks special - do you
see anywhere you can click? - would you click on it? - if yes, continue
- if no, make note, and continue - explain: due to the limitation of the
prototype, the test will continue on a separate page where you can ask
questions - is there anything you would like to ask the helper? - notice
if the user picks from sample questions - remind the user they can come
up with their own question - as the ai is generating content ask: do you
see any information in this content - did you know this before or is
there any info you didn't know before? make note. - front page: explain
the helper takes into account your personal info and goals. - ask: what
kind of information do you think important to share with the helper?

Tuesday 30. April 14:05-14:45 - 7CYQ6

The app aims to address the market failure by providing consumers
sufficient sustainability information on the goods, services and
investments.

and adopt the doughnut economy as my overarching theoretical framework

Humans are successful because of our adaptability. The study suggests
tools to adapt to our current reality.

United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration

Hypothesis: extractive business practices reduce college students trust,
regenerative business practices create trust among college students
towards the company.

Provided there is awareness

How can sustainability-minded college students find companies that meet
their expectations, standards and requirements?

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Make a public profile of my carbon consumption!!! Like on Commons.
\item
  Shop
\item
  Save
\item
  Invest
\item
  Build closer relationships with sustainability-focused companies
\item
  Sales funnel for eco-focused products
\item
  The eco-friendly market is fragmented
\item
  Build trust, clarity, transparency, and honesty
\item
  Make a `Sustainability Flywheel' graphic, like that of Amazon's
\item
  Sustainability is fragmented. How can billions of people build closer
  relationships with sustainability-focused companies based on honesty
  and transparency? A research project for designing a sustainable
  shopping, savings, and investing companion.
\item
  Most sustainability plans rely on carbon credits to achieve their
  goals, making carbon credits a single point of failure. If the credits
  are not accurate, the whole system collapses.
\item
  TODO: Make a table showing research results translated to design
  decisions
\item
  Your Green Helper
\item
  Make some initial prototype? make YoutTbe video\ldots{} hi, you have
  reached? spread\ldots{} through ESTBan and others?
\item
  Currently CO\textsubscript{2} footprint calculators ask you a couple
  of questions and give a ballpark estimate. Does it make sense to track
  sustainability on a more nuanced level, like Apple Health, in order to
  encourage sustainable behavior?

\item
  Sustainability is hard. Green Filter helps you find companies that are
  making a true effort and build closer relationships through shopping,

  young adults getting started with (green) investing. What would a
  ``Tinder for (Green) Investments'' look like? How can we make the
  logistics of investing so easy to use and take into account my values?
\item
  My thesis core message is : everyone should change from consumer to
  sustainability investor (define these terms in the thesis). how to do
  this? can help you become from consumer to investor i believe there's
  space for a product like that. your green investing friend find the
  companies tackling certain problems and invest in them using crypto
  business can be a force for good
\item
  Consumer purchases are an indicator of demand. If demand trends down,
  companies will stop producing this product.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{`Investment-as-Product'}\label{investment-as-product}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Green Filter helps you discover how to save money and the planet with
  your daily shopping. By providing an easy way for people to learn
  about and shop with sustainable companies, we imagine a world where
  people invest in their future, find great deals on responsibly-made
  products, and get useful discounts from socially responsible brands.
\item
  GreenFilter is a product that combines AI, design and marketing to
  help people manage their social impact throughout the stages of their
  lives, from young adult years to retirement. Its primary goal is to
  give people the tools they need to invest responsibly in sustainable
  companies, while also educating them on this topic. Our project offers
  a responsive website and mobile app that leverages AI and other
  advanced technologies. In addition, our prototype includes a
  reality-based virtual assistant with voice command capabilities which
  can provide customers with new insights into the world of green
  finance
\item
  GreenFilter introduces a novel, interactive point-of-sale technology
  that helps people make greener shopping decisions. The platform uses
  artificial intelligence to suggest green alternatives for products on
  your shopping list, and will also help you to find other companies
  that can make sustainable versions of the product you are buying.
\item
  As people become aware of the impact their shopping is having on the
  environment, they become interested in finding alternatives to big
  brands and large companies. GreenFilter provides designers an AI
  companion design which helps people build relationships with
  sustainability-focused companies by providing personalized
  recommendations, giving product reviews and helping them shop
  sustainably. This new tool will empower consumers to make greener
  choices throughout their lives.
\item
  Better management of planet Earth
\item

  opportunity to mark themselves to keep a conscious consumers and
  investors.
\item
  We want to create competition around sustainable practices enter
  widespread adoption
\item
  Cigarettes and pictures of lung cancer every product should be
  required to have photos of production conditions switch such as
  Rainforest and deforestation the products that include Palm oil.
\item
  My thesis is that a lot of people want to do good, shop eco-friendly,
  invest green, etc. But they don't believe the solutions work. They
  don't have trust. This is a user interface issue. How to build trust.

\subsection{Early Feature Ideas}\label{early-feature-ideas}

The following early prototypes are focused on particular feature ideas
that occurred to me during the literature review process. They are naive
and meant to allow thinking in terms of \emph{what-if} a particular user
experience was possible. These prototypes were not tested with users
directly and formed a basis for directing the questions asked in a
potential user survey.

\subsection{Susan (Sustainability
Conversation)}\label{susan-sustainability-conversation}

\emph{What if} I could have a chat like this at the supermarket? Imagine
what questions I would ask before buying a product. AI: ``Kris, do you
still remember Coca Cola's packaging is a large contributor to ocean
plastic? You even went to a beach cleanup!'' Me: ``That's so sad but
it's tasty!'' AI. ``Remember your values. Would you like to start saving
for investing in insect farms in Indonesia instead? Predicted return 4\%
per year, according to analysts A and B.'' If I'm not so sure, I could
continue the conversation. Me: ``Tell me more'' AI: ``A recent UN study
says, the planet needs to grow 70\% more food in the next 40 years.
Experts from 8 investment companies predict growth for this category of
assets.'' Me: ``Thanks for reminding me who I am'' \ldots{} Moments
later. AI: ``This shampoo is made by Unilever, which is implicated in
deforestation in Indonesia according to reporting by World Forest Watch.
Would you consider buying another brand instead? They have a higher ESG
rating.''

Example Suggestions of the AI companion:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  ``Don't buy a car, use a car sharing service instead to save XYZ CO2.
  Service available near you: Bolt,* Uber.''
\item
  ``Use a refillable shampoo bottle to save XYZ plastic pollution''
\item
  ``Call your local politician to nudge them to improve bicycle paths
  and reduce cars in your neighborhood. Over the past 2 years, you city
  has experienced an increase of cars from 290 cars per capita to 350
  cars per capita.''*
\end{itemize}

Figure 3: Speculative scenario of an interaction between a human user
and a robo-advisor through the interface of chat messages in the context
of retail shopping for daily products.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

How can finance enable/help/encourage sustainability? Personalized
Investing

An open question is whether young investors are more easily than
professionals swayed by influencers?

, Can the democratization of various uses of money include
sustainability as a feature?

For consumer activism to become mainstream it needs to much simpler.
Consumers do have increasing power to use their money to reinforces
certain types of businesses; as conscious consumers we can vote with our
dollars. How can we do it？ Sustainable brands, ESG, etc, etc. Pushing
highers Standards and choose companies that adopt circular design'' What
is the consumer CO\textsubscript{2} contribution? What is the target?
Consume pressure to advance ESG regulatory standards to add a baseline
ESG dynamic pricing of risk like climate, mandatory climate disclosures,
carbon pricing knowing your supply chain, analyze supply chain risk.

Product-level reporting can be a basis for investing in companies.
``Product-investing''. I want to invest in particular products.

Overconsumption and underinvestment. -, includes financial products
creating pathways towards sustainability-focused investing.

\textbf{Important: ``creating sustainability trust in companies in
realtime''}

My home country Estonia at the time was considered low-income, a small
nation in poverty behind the \emph{Iron Curtain} occupation of the
Soviet Union; we now in 2024, have also reached high-income status.

Memes and AI assistant can be a tool for empowerment. I would like to
have an AI agent to set my requirements and preferences and give a
``f*** you'' middle finger to companies that don't meet them. I could
also give a thumbs up to companies that meet my expectations. Perhaps
the user interface could like Tinder where I can swipe left and right.

How can AI interfaces enable/help/encourage sustainability? AI-fying
User Interfaces (for Sustainability)

Trend of sustainably, how can sustainability become more accessible?
People want to shop, save, and invest sustainably - how to do it?

Sustainable capital allocation methods are many. The extent to which
this funnel works - and it's indeed a complex, multi--step funnel -
depends on curbing greenwashing to a level that allows consumers to
distinguish eco--friendly businesses from the heavy polluters.

ESG reports are very general and opaque. We need product-level analytics
and reporting to be able to compare products.. ESG is filled with
greenwashing. ESG is a really low bad. metrics and goals: ESG, SDGs, ESG
risk. Q: Reflection on the ESG wave: Does a company that performs well
in carbon reduction but whose products are harmful to health conform to
the spirit of ESG? Sest ei saa ESG ja teisi mõõdikuid usaldada,
crowdsourced mõõdikud.

My thesis centers on embedding transparency into every stage of a
product's life--cycle, from raw‐material sourcing through purchase to
end‐of‐life recycling, so that young adults can make truly informed,
sustainability-driven financial decisions.

Investing is a fundamentally hopeful act. It means I think there's a
future. Specifically, `green investing' is investing in the future of
our planet - but can we trust the sustainability practices the `green'
investment vehicles aggregate, promising to have a positive impact? For
example, the European Union for many years counted biomass as `green'
energy, even while forestry companies were cutting down trees to produce
the biomass - the regulation was not specific enough to curb this
practice. So, in effect, a `green investor' might be supporting
deforestation. How can an easy-to-use investment app address such
complexities without alienating the users?

Copy-investing is a popular feature of retail investing platforms like
EToro

For young people, investing mostly means buying cryptocurrencies?

It can be as mundane as choosing the next eco-friendly product instead
of the polluting one we purchase in the supermarket make a difference?
How to invest in the growth of companies that put ESG at the center of
their activities instead of using it for greenwashing? Creating direct
ties will improve ESG. A journey from consumption to investing, in line
with users' personal values, by providing relevant sustainable finance
guidance.

Consumption is ruining the world the world thinking as an investor the
investor mindset. But there's so much capital in large funds retails
investor money doesn't matter at all. does retail money make any
difference? Retail Investor Helpers: A wide number of banks are offering
services marketed a sustainable. It's hard to decide. Gamestop for
climate massively collaborative investing by gen-z?

to consumer demand for greener products and services, and new tools such

advancements in large-scale computational technologies to analyze large

about the environment, I ask myself how can interaction design
contribute to increase sustainability? I make the assumption that
investing is inherently ``good'' for one's life, in the same way, that
doing sports is good, or eating healthy is good. It's one of the human
activities that is required for an improved quality of life as we age -

& Using ``green filter'' you can get a personalized sustainability plan
and personal coach to become healthy and nature-friendly. \\
& All green categories --- Green hub --- Ask the user to prioritize \\
& In my ``green filter'' AI advisor app's scenario, the AI is scanning
for opportunities matching the user's sustainable investment appetite
and risk profile, using different methods of analysis, including
alternative data sources. Traditionally, financial analysts only looked
at traditional data, such as company reports, government reports,
historic performance, etc., for preparing advisory guidance to their
clients. With the advent of AI and big data analysis, many other options
of research data have become available, for example, accurate weather
predictions for agriculture can affect guidance, because of expected
future weather disasters in the area. Other examples include policy
predictions, pollution metrics, etc. \\
& Professional financial advisors use automated tools to analyze data
and present it in human form to clients. Today's ubiquitous mobile
interfaces, however, provide the opportunity to `cut out the middleman'
and provide similar information to clients directly, at a lower cost and
a wider scale, often without human intervention. Additional (more
expensive) ``human-judgment- as-a-service'', a combination of robots +
human input, can help provide further personalized advice for the
consumer, still at a cheaper price than a dedicated human advisor.
Everyone can have a financial advisor. \\
& Narrative design bring together film school \textbf{storytelling}
experience with design. \\
& Rebuilt the app as a personalized, narrative lifestyle feed. \\
& How the design can connect people to sustainable outcomes while
shopping and investing? Perhaps even forming a community of sustainable
action. What I showed in class looks like an app but it could also be a
physical object (a speculative design). From the presentations I saw
most students seemed to be interested in form and light (many lamps) and
a couple were about medical uses. I don't remember seeing one that could
be compatible with the environmental sustainability focus
unfortunately\ldots{} \\
& \textbf{Guided Sustainability} ``refers to a concept of using
technology, such as AI and machine learning, to help individuals and
organizations make more sustainable decisions and take actions that
promote environmental and social sustainability. This can include things
like analyzing data on resource usage and emissions, providing
recommendations for reducing the environmental impact of operations, or
helping to identify and track progress towards sustainability goals. The
goal of guided sustainability is to make it easier for people to
understand their impact on the environment and to take steps to reduce
that impact.'' \\
& Young people are stuck inside platforms. You don't own the data you
put on TikTok. You can't leave because you'll lose the audience. \\
& With this perspective of scale, what would a shopping experience look
like if one knew at the point of sale, which products are greener, and
which are more environmentally polluting? \\
& AI Financial Advisors will need to go further to motivate users.
because of the nature of the technology, which is based on the quality
of the data the systems ingest, they are prone to mistakes. \\
Generative AI & Allow producers to make use of Speculative and
Participatory design to test out new product ideas? \\
& Processes sustain things: implication for design: built an app \\
& If sustainability can't be automated, give the user buttons to choose
a sustainable option. \\

Voice Assistants & There are many distinct ways how an algorithm can
communicate with a human. From a simple search box such as Google's to
chatbots, voices, avatars, videos, to full physical manifestation, there
are interfaces to make it easier for the human communicate with a
machine. \\
Sustainability & While I'm supportive of the idea of using AI assistants
to highlight more sustainable choices, I'm critical of the tendency of
the above examples to shift full environmental responsibility to the
consumer. Sustainability is a complex interaction, where the producers'
conduct can be measured and businesses can bear responsibility for their
processes, even if there's market demand for polluting products. \\
Sustainability & Personal sustainability projects haven't so far
achieved widespread adoption, making the endeavor to influence human
behaviors towards sustainability with just an app - like its commonplace
for health and sports activity trackers such as Strava (fig.~9) -, seem
unlikely. Personal notifications and chat messages are not enough unless
they provide the right motivation. Could visualizing a connection to a
larger system, showing the impact of the eco-friendly actions taken by
the user, provide a meaningful motivation to the user, and a strong
signal to the businesses? \\
Machine Learning & All of the interfaces mentioned above make use of
machine learning (ML), a tool in the AI programming paradigm for finding
patterns in large sets of data, which enables making predictions useful
in various contexts, including financial decisions. These software
innovations enable new user experiences, providing an interactive
experience through chat (chatbots), using voice generation (voice

\subsection{What is Research?}\label{what-is-research}

I, as the researcher, am similar to the blind people in the elephant
story; focusing on greening shopping, saving, and investing are only the
trunk of the enormous elephant that is environmental disaster unfolding
in front of our eyes.

online/offline ethnographic participant observation At this stage in the
research, the central concept being studied is defined generally as user
expectations for a sustainable investment app.

What are my hypotheses?

User experiments

Financial statistics

Analyzing existing apps and user pain-points

List of topics gleaned from literature review for discussion with the
experts:

Transparency and sources of ESG and similar data

I will test the prototype with potential users using an online choice
experiment survey.

Research Process In terms of literature review, academic inquiry in
social sciences largely follows phenomena, while the issues and
technologies discussed here are emergent. Not many studies exist yet
(they might in a few years), which is why some of my references are to
company press releases and news stories, or for public companies, their
advisory for investors.

Target potential retail investors aged in generation-z 20-29, all gender
in Taiwan. In general, the Taiwanese culture is savings oriented: I'm in
a good location for financial user experience research.

Set your target goals

Access to health care

Access to education

Climate action

I propose \emph{interfaces} and \emph{workflows} to see financial
interactions through the filter of sustainability.

What kind of sustainability info do college students care about? How
would college students prefer to interact with the AI? What role would
college students prefer the AI to take? How can college students trust
AI? What can college students do to aid sustainability efforts? How
might AI assistants help college students find shopping, saving, and
investing opportunities?

How can design enable/help/encourage sustainability?

also known as circular economy. Assuming that as individuals we want to
act in a sustainable way, how exactly would be go about doing that?

\ldots for Sustainable Products

\emph{Results: Open data is needed for civic engagement. Sharing vs
privacy is a political question. Privacy and data-sharing are not in
opposition. Sustainability needs to be balanced with privacy.}

Give Gen-Z the tools to turn climate anger into positive change to
transform companies

Use imagination

Young people expect a product.

Societal movements change things: implication for design: build a
community

Growing public understanding of how nature works and intersects with our
use of money to buy products, creates interest in understanding ``where
does stuff come from''. Sustainable supply chains.

``Systemic change through financial actions driving policy and market
changes encourage broader industry shifts towards greener practices''.

Overconsumption-driven extractive business practices contribute to the
degradation of Earth's natural ecosystems, pollution of water, air, and
soil, deforestation, diminishing biodiversity, climate instability,
extreme weather, modern slavery, worsening human health, and other
environmental and social challenges (ADD CITATION). Companies are
attuned to consumer demand however widespread greenwashing makes it
tiring to find sustainability-focused companies and requires extensive
time for research. Even for highly motivated people, it's difficult to
know what's sustainable.

My interest lies in understanding how AI assistants can help conscious
consumers become sustainable investors. The purpose of this study is to
explore how to provide the best user experience to potential sustainable
financial AI companion users. In their sustainability report every
company looks perfect. How can people shop, save and invest sustainably?
Where does our money go and what are some greener alternatives? The
companion enables people to be more transparent and responsible in their
consumption behavior.

In Taiwan water is too polluted can't swim

air is too dirty can't breather (show my own stats)

Start local then go global with backup data from global sources

Ask chatgpt how to organize my sections

show factories on the map

instead of the browser pluging just make a website where you can share
the link of the product (and cache rhe results)

on ios can use the share screen to share to the app?

ICID calls upon us to have the courage to redesign entire industries

This research takes place at the intersection of Taiwanese college
students, sustainability, finance, AI, and design.

For the average person like myself, my experience with money is mostly
limited to buying things at the supermarket. Food, clothes, furniture,
soap, mobile phone. This leaves very few options on how to start with
something new like saving and investing.

Could the Green Supermarket become the entry point to Green Savings and
Green Investing?

Oboarding more people for sustainable practices is a complex interaction
design issue hindered by ambiguous data (what is sustainable?) and messy
human motivations (we love buying things).

What can people who want to preserve Earth's environment, exactly do?
How can networks of people come together?

--- LLMs enable data journalists to create stories: Big Local News
(2024)

Health tracking apps paired with connected devices such as Apple Watch
filled with sensors provide one model for simple interactions to
dynamically track digital health data - also known as a quantified self.
This data allows apps to provide tips how to improve health outcomes
through small daily actions such as climbing more stairs. Small
interactions allow users to align their goals with their actions.

What would be a good interface to track sustainability? What is the user
interface at scale, useful for billions of people?

One way to influence societal outcomes is to decide where to put our
money. While our financial decisions are a vote towards the type of
businesses we want to support, is it enough?

While some people are demanding sustainability, and some governments and
companies are announcing green investment opportunities, how can
consumers discover the most suitable investment options for their
situation?

How can retail investors access and differentiate between eco-friendly
sustainability-focused investable assets?

The level of knowledge of and exposure to investing varies widely
between countries and people.

Could linking green consumption patterns with sustainable investing
provide another pathway to speed up achieving climate justice as well as
personal financial goals?

In this simplified scenario, I'm in a physical offline store, doing some
shopping. When putting a bottle of Coca Cola in my basket, my AI
companion Susan will ask me a personalized question:

Does individual climate action help?

Gen-Z college students (target users) may not have the capital to make a
financial dent today however they can be early adopter and they will be
the decision-makers in a few years.

``Like climate change, the focus on individual actions as a solution is
often misplaced, though it remains a focus of media and industry. For
decades, the petrochemical industry has offloaded responsibility onto
individuals through promoting concepts such as the''carbon footprint'',
championed in a 2004 advertising campaign by British Petroleum'' Lavers
et al. (2022).

Individual efforts are too small to matter unless they're inspired by
Community a effort

\subsection{Google Chrome Extentsion}\label{google-chrome-extentsion}

While Google is the most popular browser with 3 billion users,
extensions are a relatively less known feature of the browser. Most
popular extensions are Grammarly, for Taiwanese students End Note is
familiar.

However it's only available for computers (extensions don't run on
phones and tablets).

\subsection{Results}\label{results-1}

The research helps me (and others) to

Avoid reinventing the wheel and duplicating existing approaches.

It aims to help app developers maximize impact by aiding complementary
additionality.

Make high-quality products. If used wisely, money can help build
communities of sustainable impact.

Define every word in the title: ``The Journey from Consumer to Investor:
Designing a Financial AI Companion for Young Adults to Help with
Sustainable Shopping, Savings, and Investing''

Journey - behavioral change takes time

Consumer - purchase goods without thinking about the effect

Investor - thinking about the return

Design - decisions

Financial - dealing with money

AI Companion - automated sidekick

Young Adults - College Students

Help - to be of assistance

Sustainable Shopping - shopping understanding the consequences

Sustainable Saving - in this context I mean Sustainable Savings, that is
reducing one's environmental footprint

Sustainable Investing - activity of thinking longer-term

\subsubsection{Open-ended Questions}\label{open-ended-questions}

\subsubsection{Close-ended Questions}\label{close-ended-questions}

\subsection{Expert Surveys}\label{expert-surveys}

\subsection{Database}\label{database}

Compile a database on relevant apps and companies in the space

Easily access data used in this research project (please wait a bit
until it loads below). The database includes sustainability-focused apps
categorized by features and problems they try to solve, sustainable
investing apps, and links to research papers.

\subsection{Design Implications from the User
Survey}\label{design-implications-from-the-user-survey}

\subsubsection{Group-Related Features}\label{group-related-features}

General theory about Taiwanese society suggests that it's low-context
and people need groups to do activities. But my survey about my
sustainability app shows that people don't pick the features for joining
groups. Joining groups was one of the least interesting choices in the
survey.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\linewidth - 2\tabcolsep) * \real{0.1696}}

\end{minipage} \\
\midrule\noalign{}
\endhead
\bottomrule\noalign{}
\endlastfoot
\textbf{Survey framing effect} & Survey respondents may feel the way I
framed the survey question for ``joining groups'' made it sound like an
extra commitment they didn't want to make. \\
\textbf{Group fatigue} & Survey respondents may already have too many
group obligations to attend to (school, work, family, etc). Joining
another new group may feel like a burden, not a benefit. \\
\textbf{Fear of awkwardness} & Survey respondents may feel joining
strangers in online group is risky, uncomfortable or unnecessary. \\
\textbf{Desire for personal achievement and changing cultural trends} &
Survey respondents may be more motivated by \emph{individual
achievement} to personally feel they are making a difference instead of
waiting for the group. Possibly they are more individualistic than my
expectations in their behavior (particularly in a digital context) and
the traditional ``group society'' stereotype is weakening. \\
\textbf{Are ``group'' and ``sustainability'' concepts related enough?} &
Survey respondents may not clearly understand the benefit for
sustainability from their joining a group. \\
\end{longtable}

Factorial Surveys (T. Li et al., 2022): ``Factorial surveys is a
research method that combines classical experiments with survey
methodologies. Factorial surveys use short narratives, called vignettes,
to represent various levels of independent variables that are too
complex or unethical to create and manipulate in real-world or lab
situations''

and a including a choice experiment between potential feature sets in
consumption, savings, and investment.

Start with a simple but powerful question: --- Does it matter what you
buy? --- Does it matter how much you save? --- Does it matter where you
invest? Why?

\subsection{Research Limitations}\label{research-limitations}

First, finance is a highly regulated industry and the proposed user
experience designs may be limited by legal requirements. This study does
not take such limitations into account, rather focusing only on the user
experience.

This work is focused on user experience design and does attempt to make
a contribution to economics.

ESG data is expensive so couldn't be used in this research. ESG needs
data to give us an accurate understanding of the realities inside
companies and the user experience design does not address the underlying
data quality problem further than by providing a link to the data
source.

I don't have access to user financial data.

Research Reason: While many people are working on AI models, there's a
lack of people working on ``Human-AI interaction''. Sustainability is
the context. How can we better team up to solve the challenges we face
this century? The huge externalities.

\subsection{Future Research}\label{future-research}

The literature is rich and there is ample space for future research. The
following includes some suggestions for authors whose work deserves a
deeper look.

Does the specialized interface offer any advantages of a general UI such
as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Mistral, and others?

Some ideas for fruitful research directions

Perception of pollution levels among Taiwanese college students.

RQ: Does AI acceptance increase with Affective Computing?

開放報名中 -
近幾年，全球的極端氣候造成各地災害頻傳，人們更加意識到要珍惜地球資源，丹麥從10幾年前就開始推行低碳生活，哥本哈根海洋上成排的風力發電機供應丹麥20\%以上的能源，哥本哈根的學校建造出全世界最大的太陽能板，甚至丹麥的設計團隊進行設計皆從永續環境為本心出發，在丹麥，每一個生活環節都是循環設計！
-
但丹麥談的循環永續不只是不具經濟效益的理念，循環經濟對丹麥來說不僅具有環境層面的效益，還可提升企業的競爭力，對資源生產力、就業機會、資源供應安全和自然資源的可持續利用都有極正向的回饋。
- 本次國際論壇，{我們邀請來自丹麥的設計師Ditte Lysgaard
Vind從循環經濟策略}、{Rosa N{ø}ss Bendixen從產品設計}、{Helene
