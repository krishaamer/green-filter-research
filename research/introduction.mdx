# Introduction

Overconsumption-driven extractive business practices contribute to the
degradation of Earth’s natural ecosystems, pollution of water, air, and
soil, deforestation, diminishing biodiversity, climate instability,
extreme weather, modern slavery, worsening human health, and other
environmental and social challenges (cite).

In 1896, the Nobel Prize winner Svante Arrhenius first calculated how an
increase in CO<sub>2</sub> levels could have a warming effect on our
global climate (Anderson, Hawkins and Jones, 2016; Wulff, 2020). 120
years later, the Paris Agreement came into effect, with countries
agreeing on non-binding targets on how to keep CO<sub>2</sub> levels 1.5
°C below pre-industrial levels (United Nations, 2016). While awareness
of Earth’s warming climate was growing, the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
kept rising too. The hockey-stick growth of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration
since the industrial revolution is clear in the data from 1958 onward,
following a steady annual increase, called the *Keeling Curve* (Keeling
and Keeling, 2017). Written records of global temperature measurements
are available starting from the 1880s when documentation of temperatures
become available in ship records (Brohan et al., 2012). Temperature
estimations from tree-trunks allow some temperature comparisons with the
climate as far back as 2000 years ago (Rubino et al., 2019).

In 1938, Guy Stewart Callendar was the first to demonstrate the warming
of Earth’s land surface as well as linking the production of fossil
fuels to increased CO<sub>2</sub> and changing climate (Hawkins and
Jones, 2013). By the latest data from 2022, the current world population
of 8 Billion people emitted 37.5 gigatonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> per year,
the highest emissions recorded in history (Statista, 2023). To limit
global warming to 1.5 °C as agreed by the world nations in Paris,
removal of 5-20 gigatons of CO<sub>2</sub> per year would be needed
according to reduction pathways calculated by the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (Wade et al., 2023). Yet, most countries
are missing the mark. Given this model of climate change, the G7
countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, United
States) are heading for 2.7 °C of warming by 2050 (CDP, 2022). The
monumental task of removing several gigatons of CO<sub>2</sub> from the
atmosphere requires massive policy shifts and collaboration across
countries and industries (Mackler, Fishman and Broberg, 2021).

In addition the enormity of emissions, humanity is facing other massive
problems. The Stockholm Resilience Centre reports we have already
breached 4 out of our 9 planetary boundaries: in addition to climate
change, biodiversity loss (Extinctions per Million Species per Year aka
E/MSY), land-system change (deforestation, land degradation, etc), and
biogeochemical flows (cycles of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, etc); on a
positive side, the challenges of fresh water use, ocean acidification
and stratospheric ozone depletion are still within planetary limits;
atmospheric aerosol loading and the biodiversity intactness index (BII)
have not yet been fully quantified (Persson et al., 2022).

## Research Relevance

If used wisely, money can help build communities of sustainable impact.

Defining the Problem Space.

This research is timely in 2023 because of the convergence of five
trends:

| Trend                                                                                      |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Growing environmental degradation                                                          |
| Young people demand for sustainability                                                     |
| Intergenerational money transfer to Millenials; relatively young people have money         |
| Appearance of sustainability metrics and instruments such as ESG, B Corp, Green Bonds, etc |
| Technology adoption and AI-based user interface availability                               |

Current trends backing the relevance of this research project.

**There’s evidence young people have money.** In the U.S. alone, the
combined annual consumer spending of Gen-Z and Millennials was over 2.5T
USD in 2020 (YPulse, 2020). Over the coming decade, in the U.S., UK, and
Australia, Millennials are inheriting 30T USD from their parents
(Calastone, 2020). There’s also some evidence of investment interest,
however there’s large geographic variance. According to a Calastone
(2020) study (n=3000) surveying people in the Millennial age group
between ages 23 and 35 in Europe (UK, France, Germany), U.S.A., Hong
Kong, and Australia, 48% of respondents located in Hong Kong owned
financial securities (such as stocks) while the figure was just 10% in
France.

| Place     | Percentage |
|-----------|------------|
| Hong Kong | 48%        |
| France    | 10%        |
|           |            |

Millenial Investors (Calastone, 2020).

Does individual climate action help?

-   <u>Gen-Z college students (target users) may not have the capital to
    make a financial dent today however they can be early adopter and
    they will be the decision-makers in a few years.</u>
-   “Like climate change, the focus on individual actions as a solution
    is often misplaced, though it remains a focus of media and industry.
    For decades, the petrochemical industry has offloaded responsibility
    onto individuals through promoting concepts such as the”carbon
    footprint”, championed in a 2004 advertising campaign by British
    Petroleum” Lavers, Bond and Rolsky (2022).
-   Individual efforts are too small to matter unless they’re inspired
    by Community a effort
-   atmospheric pollution and climate change

## Research Background

I grew up reading science fiction books and their influence on my
outlook towards future possibilities continues until present day. Star
Trek has a portable device called a ***tricorder*** (fig. 1), which
enables imaginary future humans fix all kinds of problems from scanning
for minerals inside a cave to scanning human bodies for medical
information. I would love to have such a device for consumer choices and
financial decisions - to know what to buy and which businesses to do
business with. Robots are already integral part of our lives; this
thesis proposal was partially written using Google’s and Apple’s Voice
recognition software, allowing me to transcribe notes with the help of
an AI assistant.

As a foreigner living in Taiwan, I’ve relied extensively on Google Maps’
AI assistant to move around efficiently, including to find food and
services, when writing in Chinese, Apple’s text prediction algorithms
translate pinyin to 漢字. Even when we don’t realize it, AI assistants
are already helping us with many of our mundane tasks. While it takes
incredibly complex computational algorithms to achieve this in the
background, it’s become so commonplace, we don’t even think about it.
From this point of view, another AI assistant to help us with greener
shopping decisions, saving CO<sub>2</sub>, and investing in more
eco-friendly businesses doesn’t sound so much of a stretch.

## Research Motivation

-   This research takes place at the intersection of Taiwanese college
    students, sustainability, finance, AI, and design.

For the average person like myself, my experience with money is mostly
limited to buying things at the supermarket. Food, clothes, furniture,
soap, mobile phone. This leaves very few options on how to start with
something new like saving and investing.

-   Could the Green Supermarket become the entry point to Green Savings
    and Green Investing?
-   Oboarding more people for sustainable practices is a complex
    interaction design issue hindered by ambiguous data (what is
    sustainable?) and messy human motivations (we love buying things).
-   What can people who want to preserve Earth’s environment, exactly
    do? How can networks of people come together?
-   Health tracking apps paired with connected devices such as Apple
    Watch filled with sensors provide one model for simple interactions
    to dynamically track digital health data - also known as a
    quantified self. This data allows apps to provide tips how to
    improve health outcomes through small daily actions such as climbing
    more stairs. Small interactions allow users to align their goals
    with their actions.
-   What would be a good interface to track sustainability? What is the
    user interface at scale, useful for billions of people?
-   One way to influence societal outcomes is to decide where to put our
    money. While our financial decisions are a vote towards the type of
    businesses we want to support, is it enough?
-   While some people are demanding sustainability, and some governments
    and companies are announcing green investment opportunities, how can
    consumers discover the most suitable investment options for their
    situation?
-   How can retail investors access and differentiate between
    eco-friendly sustainability-focused investable assets?
-   The level of knowledge of and exposure to investing varies widely
    between countries and people.
-   Could linking green consumption patterns with sustainable investing
    provide another pathway to speed up achieving climate justice as
    well as personal financial goals?
-   In this simplified scenario, I’m in a physical offline store, doing
    some shopping. When putting a bottle of Coca Cola in my basket, my
    ***AI companion Susan*** will ask me a personalized question:

```

## Research Objective

The study presents an AI companion design which seeks to help people
build relationships with sustainability-focused companies. The major
contribution of this study is an interactive artefact (a prototype)
informed by design research.

It seems impossible to know which company is more sustainable than the
other. We don’t really know what’s green, unless we spend a lot of time
looking at the data. Environmental issues are caused by production and
manufacturing processes of the companies that make the products we
consume on a daily basis. The companion enables people to be more
transparent and responsible in their consumption behavior.

My interest lies in understanding how AI assistants can help conscious
consumers become sustainable investors. The purpose of this study is to
explore how to provide the best user experience to potential sustainable
financial AI companion users. In their sustainability report every
company looks perfect. How can people shop, save and invest sustainably?
Where does our money go and what are some greener alternatives?
