# Introduction

How can people build closer relationships with sustainability-focused
companies? A research project for designing a sustainable shopping,
saving, and investing companion.

## Research Relevance

If used wisely, money can help build communities of sustainable impact.
This research is timely in 2023 because of the convergence of five
trends:

## Research Background

I grew up reading science fiction books and their influence on my
outlook towards future possibilities continues until present day. Star
Trek has a portable device called a ***tricorder*** (fig. 1), which
enables imaginary future humans fix all kinds of problems from scanning
for minerals inside a cave to scanning human bodies for medical
information. I would love to have such a device for consumer choices and
financial decisions - to know what to buy and which businesses to do
business with. Robots are already integral part of our lives; this
thesis proposal was partially written using Google’s and Apple’s Voice
recognition software, allowing me to transcribe notes with the help of
an AI assistant.

## Research Motivation

As a foreigner living in Taiwan, I’ve relied extensively on AI
assistants for many aspects of my life: to communicate, move around
efficiently, find food and services. Even when we don’t realize it, AI
assistants helping us with many of our mundane tasks. When writing in
Chinese, Apple’s text prediction algorithms translate pinyin to 漢字 and
show the most likely character based on my previous writing, Google’s
maps find efficient and eco-friendly routes and recommend places to eat
and ChatGPT provides statistically probable advice from the sum of human
knowledge. While it takes incredibly complex computational algorithms to
achieve all this in the background, it’s become so commonplace, we don’t
even think about it. From this point of view, another AI assistant to
help humans with choosing more eco-friendly businesses to show, save,
and invest doesn’t sound so much of a stretch.

## Research Objective

Without reliable and easily accessible data, it seems impossible to know
which company is more sustainable than the other. We don’t really know
what’s green, unless we spend a lot of time looking at the numbers.
Environmental issues are caused by production and manufacturing
processes of the companies that make the products we consume on a daily
basis. The study presents an AI companion design which seeks to help
people build relationships with sustainability-focused companies. The
major contribution of this study is an interactive artefact (a
prototype) informed by design research.

## Research Demographics

My research targets respondents according to the following criteria.

experiment between potential feature sets in consumption, savings, and
investment.
