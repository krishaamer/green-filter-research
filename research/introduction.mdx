# Introduction

How can college students find sustainability-focused companies? My
research describes the process of designing a sustainable shopping,
saving, and investing AI companion.

AIs are integral to many parts of our lives; this thesis was written
using Google’s, Apple’s, and OpenAIs voice recognition software,
allowing me to transcribe notes with the help of an AI assistant. As a
foreigner in Taiwan, I relied on AI for many aspects of my life:
speaking, moving, finding food and services. Even when we don’t realize
it, AI is helping us with many mundane tasks. When writing in Chinese,
Apple’s text prediction algorithms translate pinyin to 漢字 and show the
most likely character based on my previous writing, Google’s maps find
efficient and eco-friendly routes and recommend places to eat and
ChatGPT provides statistically probable advice from the sum of human
knowledge. While it takes incredibly complex computational algorithms to
achieve all this in the background, it’s become so commonplace, we don’t
even think about it. From this point of view, another AI assistant to
help humans with choosing more eco-friendly businesses - to shop, save,
and invest - doesn’t sound so much of a stretch. (First written in
2020).

If used wisely, money can help build communities of sustainable impact
and help build closer relationships with sustainability.

## Relevance

The convergence of 5 trends makes this research timely.

## Background

I grew up reading science fiction books which influenced my outlook
towards future possibilities. In particular, Star Trek has a portable
device called a ***tricorder*** (fig. 1) enabling imaginary humans fix
many problems. From looking for minerals inside a cave to scanning human
bodies for medical information. I would love to have such a device for
consumer choices and financial decisions in order to know what to buy
and which businesses to support.

## Motivation

Environmental degradation is largely driven by manufacturing processes
of the products we consume daily. From resource extraction i.e. mining
raw materials and drilling for fossil fuels to chemical processes
causing contamination and pollution of the air, water, and soil to waste
generation and greenhouse gas emissions, industries transform the
natural world into consumer products. While industry practices have
improved since the industrial revolution in the 19th century, and
continue to improve, it’s possible to further improve standards of
production and raise the global baseline for sustainability.

Nonetheless, without easily accessible and reliable data, it’s difficult
to know which company is more sustainable than another. As consumers and
investors (even if only through passive savings), we don’t really know
what are their production practices, unless we spend a lot of time
looking at the numbers, which may be costly to access (for example ESG
reports are expensive), and mostly rely on our governments and
international bodies to keep us safe. Or just look at the brands
themselves - and pick the ones which we like.

## Objective

The study presents design research for developing an AI companion to
help college students find sustainable companies for shopping, saving
and investing. The major contribution of my study is an interactive
artefact (a prototype) informed by design research.

## Demographics

The research focuses on young adults, specifically Taiwanese college
students studying in Taiwan.
