# Introduction

How can college students find sustainable companies? Furthermore, if
given appropriate tools, could college students leverage their
purchasing power to reward sustainable companies?

My research describes the process of designing an AI companion for
college students to help with sustainable shopping, saving, and
investing.

Money spent shopping, saving, and investing in sustainable companies
serves as an incentive to adopt more sustainable practices. If used
wisely, money can reward companies for becoming more sustainable.

Encourage the least sustainable companies to improve their performance,
raising the overall baseline.

Facilitate the formation of communities centered around environmental
stewardship.

Build closer relationships with sustainability.

## Relevance

The research addresses the ***“attitude-behavior gap”*** among Taiwanese
college students in taking sustainable financial action.

Convergence of the following 5 trends makes my research timely in 2024.

## Background

I grew up as an avid science fiction reader, which influenced my outlook
towards future possibilities. In particular, the Star Trek universe had
an imaginary portable device called a ***tricorder*** (fig. 1) enabling
scientists to scan anything for insights. Be it precious minerals inside
a cave or scanning the human bodies for medical data, its sensors would
show up with some useful data. In daily life, I would love to have such
a device for consumer choices and financial decisions - to know what to
buy and which businesses to support with my money and approval.

````

While a *tricorder* is still science fiction, technological advancements
are getting closer and closer to producing something similar. AIs are
already integral to many parts of our lives, with computer models
producing increasingly useful outputs. The proposal for this thesis was
first written using Google’s and Apple’s voice recognition software in
2020, and later switching to OpenAI’s *Whisper* model, allowing me to
transcribe notes with the help of an AI assistant. As a foreigner living
in Taiwan since 2019, I relied on AI-based tools for many aspects of my
life: speaking, moving, finding food and services. When writing in
Chinese, Apple’s text prediction algorithms translate pinyin to 漢字 and
show the most likely character based on my previous writing, Google’s
maps find efficient and eco-friendly routes and recommend places to eat
and ChatGPT provides statistically probable advice from the sum of human
knowledge. Even when we don’t realize it, AI is helping us with many
mundane tasks. While it takes incredibly complex computational
algorithms to achieve all this in the background, it’s become so
commonplace, we don’t even think about it. From this point of view,
another AI assistant to help students with choosing more eco-friendly
businesses - to shop, save, and invest - doesn’t sound so much of a
stretch.

## Motivation

Environmental degradation is increasingly affecting human lives - and
it’s largely driven by manufacturing processes - of the products we
consume daily. From resource extraction in the linear economy (mining
raw materials and drilling for fossil fuels) to chemical processes
(causing contamination and pollution of the air, water, and soil) to
waste generation and greenhouse gas emissions, industries transform the
natural world into consumer products. While industry practices have
improved since the industrial revolution in the 19th century, and
continue to improve, it’s possible to further improve standards of
production and raise the global baseline for sustainability, given
enough societal pressure to do so.

Nonetheless, without easily accessible and reliable data, it’s difficult
to know which company is more sustainable than another. As consumers and
investors (even if only through passive ownership of savings), we don’t
really know much about enterprise production practices, unless we spend
a lot of time looking at the numbers, which may be costly to access (for
example ESG reports are expensive), and mostly rely on our governments
and international bodies to keep us safe. Or just look at the brands
themselves - and pick the ones which we like.

## Objective

The study presents design research for developing an AI companion to
help college students find sustainable companies for shopping, saving
and investing. The major contribution of my study is an interactive
artefact (a prototype) informed by design research.

## Demographics

The research focuses on young adults, specifically Taiwanese college
students studying in Taiwan.

Experts (finance, design, sustainability).

## Research Questions

My research answers the following questions.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[3] }} />

-   What factors increase potential users choosing sustainable
    investing?

-   What class of investment vehicles do potential users show the most
    interest in?

-   What application features do potential users rate as the highest
    priority?
