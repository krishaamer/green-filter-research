# Introduction

How can people build closer relationships with sustainability-focused
companies? A research project for designing a sustainable shopping,
savings, and investing companion.

## Research Relevance

If used wisely, money can help build communities of sustainable impact.

Defining the Problem Space.

This research is timely in 2023 because of the convergence of five
trends:

| Trend                                                                                      |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Growing environmental degradation                                                          |
| Young people demand for sustainability                                                     |
| Intergenerational money transfer to Millenials; relatively young people have money         |
| Appearance of sustainability metrics and instruments such as ESG, B Corp, Green Bonds, etc |
| Technology adoption and AI-based user interface availability                               |

Current trends backing the relevance of this research project.

Does individual climate action help?

-   <u>Gen-Z college students (target users) may not have the capital to
    make a financial dent today however they can be early adopter and
    they will be the decision-makers in a few years.</u>
-   “Like climate change, the focus on individual actions as a solution
    is often misplaced, though it remains a focus of media and industry.
    For decades, the petrochemical industry has offloaded responsibility
    onto individuals through promoting concepts such as the”carbon
    footprint”, championed in a 2004 advertising campaign by British
    Petroleum” Lavers, Bond and Rolsky (2022).
-   Individual efforts are too small to matter unless they’re inspired
    by Community a effort
-   atmospheric pollution and climate change
-   The latest IPCC report Calvin et al. (2023)
-   Dimock (2019)
-   kora 95% https://kora.app/
-   I, as the researcher, am similar to the blind people in the elephant
    story; focusing on greening shopping, saving, and investing are only
    the trunk of the enormous elephant that is environmental disaster
    unfolding in front of our eyes.

## Research Background

I grew up reading science fiction books and their influence on my
outlook towards future possibilities continues until present day. Star
Trek has a portable device called a ***tricorder*** (fig. 1), which
enables imaginary future humans fix all kinds of problems from scanning
for minerals inside a cave to scanning human bodies for medical
information. I would love to have such a device for consumer choices and
financial decisions - to know what to buy and which businesses to do
business with. Robots are already integral part of our lives; this
thesis proposal was partially written using Google’s and Apple’s Voice
recognition software, allowing me to transcribe notes with the help of
an AI assistant.

As a foreigner living in Taiwan, I’ve relied extensively on Google Maps
(which can be considered a type of AI assistant) to move around
efficiently, including to find food and services, when writing in
Chinese, Apple’s text prediction algorithms translate pinyin to 漢字.
Even when we don’t realize it, AI assistants are already helping us with
many of our mundane tasks. While it takes incredibly complex
computational algorithms to achieve this in the background, it’s become
so commonplace, we don’t even think about it. From this point of view,
another AI assistant to help us with greener shopping decisions, saving
CO<sub>2</sub>, and investing in more eco-friendly businesses doesn’t
sound so much of a stretch.

## Research Motivation

in taiwan water is too pollutee can’t swim

air is too dirty can’t breather (show my own stats)

-   start local then go global with backup data from global sources
-   ask chatgpt how to organize my sections

rq: how to connect env destruction pollution to source causes

rq: how to connect everyday financial actions to environmental impact in
a visual/ meaningful way

-   idea came riding my bike in annan can’t swim in yhe annan river

-   show local pollution map?

-   show factories on the map

-   instead of the browser pluging just make a website where you can
    share the link of the product (and cache rhe results)

-   on ios can use the share screen to share to the app?

-   ICID calls upon us to have the courage to redesign entire industries

-   This research takes place at the intersection of Taiwanese college
    students, sustainability, finance, AI, and design.

For the average person like myself, my experience with money is mostly
limited to buying things at the supermarket. Food, clothes, furniture,
soap, mobile phone. This leaves very few options on how to start with
something new like saving and investing.

-   Could the Green Supermarket become the entry point to Green Savings
    and Green Investing?
-   Oboarding more people for sustainable practices is a complex
    interaction design issue hindered by ambiguous data (what is
    sustainable?) and messy human motivations (we love buying things).
-   What can people who want to preserve Earth’s environment, exactly
    do? How can networks of people come together?
-   Health tracking apps paired with connected devices such as Apple
    Watch filled with sensors provide one model for simple interactions
    to dynamically track digital health data - also known as a
    quantified self. This data allows apps to provide tips how to
    improve health outcomes through small daily actions such as climbing
    more stairs. Small interactions allow users to align their goals
    with their actions.
-   What would be a good interface to track sustainability? What is the
    user interface at scale, useful for billions of people?
-   One way to influence societal outcomes is to decide where to put our
    money. While our financial decisions are a vote towards the type of
    businesses we want to support, is it enough?
-   While some people are demanding sustainability, and some governments
    and companies are announcing green investment opportunities, how can
    consumers discover the most suitable investment options for their
    situation?
-   How can retail investors access and differentiate between
    eco-friendly sustainability-focused investable assets?
-   The level of knowledge of and exposure to investing varies widely
    between countries and people.
-   Could linking green consumption patterns with sustainable investing
    provide another pathway to speed up achieving climate justice as
    well as personal financial goals?
-   In this simplified scenario, I’m in a physical offline store, doing
    some shopping. When putting a bottle of Coca Cola in my basket, my
    ***AI companion Susan*** will ask me a personalized question:

## Research Objective

The study presents an AI companion design which seeks to help people
build relationships with sustainability-focused companies. The major
contribution of this study is an interactive artefact (a prototype)
informed by design research.

It seems impossible to know which company is more sustainable than the
other. We don’t really know what’s green, unless we spend a lot of time
looking at the data. Environmental issues are caused by production and
manufacturing processes of the companies that make the products we
consume on a daily basis. The companion enables people to be more
transparent and responsible in their consumption behavior.

My interest lies in understanding how AI assistants can help conscious
consumers become sustainable investors. The purpose of this study is to
explore how to provide the best user experience to potential sustainable
financial AI companion users. In their sustainability report every
company looks perfect. How can people shop, save and invest sustainably?
Where does our money go and what are some greener alternatives?
