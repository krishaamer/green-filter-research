# Introduction

How can college students find sustainability-focused companies? My
research project describes the process of designing a sustainable
shopping, saving, and investing companion. If used wisely, money can
help build communities of sustainable impact and helpo build closer
relationships with sustainability.

## Research Relevance

My research is timely in 2024 because of the convergence of the
following 5 major trending themes:

## Research Background

I grew up reading science fiction books and their influence on my
outlook towards future possibilities continues until present day. In
particular, Star Trek has a portable device called a ***tricorder***
(fig. 1), which enables imaginary future humans fix all kinds of
problems from looking for minerals inside a cave to scanning human
bodies for medical information. I would love to have such a device for
consumer choices and financial decisions in order to know what to buy
and which businesses to do business with.

## Research Motivation

Environmental issues are largely caused by production and manufacturing
processes of the companies that make the products we consume on a daily
basis. Without reliable and easily accessible data, it’s difficult to
know which company is more sustainable than the other. We don’t really
know what’s green, unless we spend a lot of time looking at the numbers,
which may be costly to access (for example ESG reports are expensive).

AIs are already integral to many parts of our lives; this thesis was
partially written using Google’s, Apple’s, and OpenAIs voice recognition
software, allowing me to transcribe notes with the help of an AI
assistant. As a foreigner living in Taiwan, I’ve relied extensively on
AI assistants for many aspects of my life: to communicate, move around
efficiently, find food and services. Even when we don’t realize it, AI
assistants helping us with many of our mundane tasks. When writing in
Chinese, Apple’s text prediction algorithms translate pinyin to 漢字 and
show the most likely character based on my previous writing, Google’s
maps find efficient and eco-friendly routes and recommend places to eat
and ChatGPT provides statistically probable advice from the sum of human
knowledge. While it takes incredibly complex computational algorithms to
achieve all this in the background, it’s become so commonplace, we don’t
even think about it. From this point of view, another AI assistant to
help humans with choosing more eco-friendly businesses to show, save,
and invest doesn’t sound so much of a stretch.

## Research Objective

The study presents an AI companion design which seeks to help people
build relationships with sustainability-focused companies. The major
contribution of this study is an interactive artefact (a prototype)
informed by design research.

## Research Demographics
