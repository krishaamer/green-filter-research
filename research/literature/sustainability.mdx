## *Measuring* Sustainability

***“Nachhaltigkeit”*** - meaning *sustainability* in German - was likely
the first use of the concept of preserving natural resources, conceived
by a tax accountant Hannß Carl von Carlowitz in 1713 in his seminal book
on forestry - *Sylvicultura oeconomica -*, referring to the goal of
achieving prudent forest management practices in his native Saxony in
Southeastern Germany, which at the time was under severe deforestation
pressure from mining, ship-building and agricultural production (Hannß
Carl von Carlowitz, 1713; Gottschlich and Friedrich, 2014). This
particular field of sustainability study is now known as *sustainable
yield of natural capital* - the principal of a natural resource, such as
in fishing and forestry shouldn’t be over-harvested in order to maintain
*ecosystem services* - a contemporary term from the theory of *natural
capital*, referring to benefits humans receiver from the stock of
world’s natural resources (Peter Kareiva et al., 2011). Perhaps more
poetically, the American wildlife ecologist Aldo Leopold proposed the
idea of ***land ethics*** in 1972 as *“\[a\] thing is right when it
tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic
community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise”* in his landmark work *A
Sand County Almanac* (Leopold, 1972). In a similar vein, the 1987 United
Nations’ Brundtland Report titled “*Our Common Future”* defined
*sustainable development* as *“Development that meets the needs of the
present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet
their own needs”* (World Commission on Environment and Development,
1987). Given these varied ideas, it could be said people have been
concerned with our planet’s natural environment and its preservation
already for centuries. Yet, it is only in the last century that human
activities have begun to affect Earth’s systems on a previously unseen
scale - termed Anthropocene -, necessitating a deeper understanding of
human-nature interactions, such as in the case of climate change, which
is deeply changing the face of our planet.

## *Measuring* Climate Change

Just as with sustainability, studies of Earth’s climate go back for more
than a century. Already in 1896, the Nobel Prize winner Svante Arrhenius
first calculated how an increase in CO<sub>2</sub> levels could have a
warming effect on our global climate (Anderson, Hawkins and Jones, 2016;
Wulff, 2020). While the scientific case for human-induced climate change
was building, it wasn’t until 120 years later, when the Paris Climate
Agreement came into effect, that countries agreed on non-binding targets
on keeping CO<sub>2</sub> levels 1.5 °C below pre-industrial levels
(United Nations, 2016). Even though awareness of Earth’s warming climate
was growing ever stronger, the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions kept rising too.
The hockey-stick growth of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration since the
industrial revolution is clear in the data from 1958 onward, following a
steady annual increase, called the *Keeling Curve* (Keeling and Keeling,
2017). Written records of global temperature measurements are available
starting from the 1880s, when documentation of temperatures began to be
recorded in ship logs (Brohan et al., 2012). Finally, although perhaps
less accurately, temperature estimations from tree-trunks allow some
comparisons with the climate as far back as 2000 years ago (Rubino et
al., 2019).

In 1938, Guy Stewart Callendar was the first scientist to demonstrate
the warming of Earth’s land surface - as well as linking the production
of fossil fuels to increased CO<sub>2</sub> and changing climate
(Hawkins and Jones, 2013). The latest data from 2023 shows our current
world population of 8 Billion people emitted 37.2 gigatonnes
(i.e. billion metric tons) of CO<sub>2</sub> per year, the highest
emissions recorded in history (Statista, 2023). In order to limit global
warming to 1.5 °C as agreed by the world nations in Paris, removal of
5-20 gigatons of CO<sub>2</sub> per year would be needed according to
reduction pathways calculated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) (Wade et al., 2023). Yet, most countries are missing the
mark (Climate Analytics and NewClimate Institute, 2023; United Nations
Environment Programme, 2023). The European Union’s Copernicus Climate
Change Service (C3S) reports 1.5 °C global warming has already been
breached in 2024 temperatures (Anon., 2024a; Anon., 2024b). Given the
current pace of climate change action, the G7 countries (Canada, France,
Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, United States) are heading for
2.7 °C of warming by 2050 (CDP, 2022).

Earth’s physical systems are very sensitive to small changes in
temperature, which was not understood until 30 years ago (McKibben,
2006).

## *Mitigating* Climate Change

The monumental task of removing several gigatons of CO<sub>2</sub> from
the atmosphere requires massive policy shifts and collaboration across
countries and industries (Mackler, Fishman and Broberg, 2021).

Warming global climate has concrete effects on daily life. Warmer
climate helps viruses and fungi spread (Press, 2023). (Williams and
Joshi, 2013) higher CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the air can cause
more turbulence for flights.

## *Breaching* Planetary Boundaries

In addition the enormity of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, humanity is facing
other massive problems. The Stockholm Resilience Centre reports we have
already breached 4 out of our 9 planetary boundaries: in addition to
climate change, biodiversity loss (Extinctions per Million Species per
Year aka E/MSY), land-system change (deforestation, land degradation,
etc), and biogeochemical flows (cycles of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus,
etc); on a positive side, the challenges of fresh water use, ocean
acidification and stratospheric ozone depletion are still within
planetary limits (Persson et al., 2022).

As long as humanity is a mono-planetary species, we have to come to
terms with the limitations of our home, Earth.

Atmospheric aerosol loading and the biodiversity intactness index (BII)
were quantified recently (ADD CITATION)

-   (Keeble, 1988) reported in April 1987 that *‘residents in
    high-income countries lead lifestyles incompatible with planetary
    boundaries’*. While my home country Estonia at the time was
    considered low-income, a small nation in poverty behind the *Iron
    Curtain* occupation of the Soviet Union, we now in 2024, have also
    reached high-income status.

In 1948, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) was
founded, which in

LULUCF “Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry” can be a source of
greenhouse gas emissions or a carbon sink (removing CO2 from the
atmosphere)

## *Integrating* Planetary Health

Cross-disciplinary scientists have been working on integrating Earth
systems into cohesive frameworks. Planetary Health and Earth System Law
are 2 approaches to address the complex interdependence.

Evolving Measurements from Planetary Boundaries to Planetary Health

-   Planetary health (Planetary Health Alliance, 2024a, 2024b)

-   Wardani et al. (2023) *“long-term human well-being is dependent on
    the well-being of the planet, including both biotic and abiotic
    systems. It recognizes interlinkages across environmental
    sustainability, public health, and socioeconomic development.”*

### Earth System Law

-   (Du Toit and Kotzé, 2022) describes *Earth System Law* as a
    framework for addressing interconnected environmental challenges.

## *Consumer* Lifestyle

Consumer lifestyle contributes to environmental destruction. According
to (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, Material Economics, 2019)’s models 45%
of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent emissions come from our shopping; produced
by companies to make the products we consume. A large scale study by
Anthony Leiserowitz et al. (2022) on Meta’s Facebook (n=108946) reported
people in Spain (65%), Sweden (61%), and Taiwan (60%) believe *“climate
change is mostly caused by human activities”.* An even larger survey
(n=1.2 million) by the United Nations across 50 countries, distributed
through mobile game ads, showed the majority of people agreeing climate
change is an “emergency” UNDP (2021). While people express eco-conscious
ideas, it’s non-trivial to practice sustainability in daily life. Deyan
Georgiev (2023) reports only 30% of people in the Gen-Z age group
believe technology can solve all problems.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[0] }} />

-   The current environmental upheaval, led by Gen-Z and Millennials,
    and the business adaptation (or lack thereof) to sustainable
    economic models, taking into account the hidden social and
    environmental costs we didn’t calculate in our pricing before.
-   We also need to consider environmental effects (E in ESG). We
    haven’t taken into account the whole cost of production, leading to
    the wrong pricing information. To achieve this, we need expert
    governance (G).

Overconsumption Drive Climate Change

Overconsumption is one of the main drivers of climate change. “2/3 of
global GHG emissions are directly and indirectly linked to household
consumption, with a global average of about 6 tonnes CO<sub>2</sub>
equivalent per capita.” (Ivanova et al., 2020; Renee Cho, 2020)

Overconsumption is also one of the root causes of plastic pollution.
(Ford et al., 2022) and (Lavers, Bond and Rolsky, 2022) find strong
linkage of climate change and marine plastic pollution “along with other
stressors that threaten the resilience of species and habitats sensitive
to both climate change and plastic pollution”.

-   \[Lavers, Bond and Rolsky (2022)\] plastic pollution is pervasive
    around the Earth and is fundamentally linked to climate change

While the number on overconsumption are clear, the debate on
overconsumption is so polarized, it’s difficult to have a meaningful
discussion of the topic (Ianole and Cornescu, 2013).

-   Overconsumption and underinvestment.

-   Cities are responsible for 80% of the emissions Rosales Carreón and
    Worrell (2018)

-   Moberg et al. (2019) reports daily human activities emission
    contribution on average in four European countries (France, Germany,
    Norway and Sweden).

    (Eesti Rohepöörde Tegevusplaan).
-   Armstrong McKay et al. (2022) discusses tipping points.

AI is being used to map icebergs and measure the change in size European
Space Agency (2023)

## *Vizualizing* Climate Change

Climate data visualization has a history of over 200 years, starting
with ***Alexander von Humboldt,*** known as the founder of climatology,
who revolutionized cartography by inventing the first *isothermal maps*
in 1816; these maps showed areas with similar temperature, variations in
altitude and seasons in different colors (Honton, 2022). Humboldt’s
isotherms are now available as 3D computer models in (Anon., 2023a).

-   Industrial revolution: : “transition to a low carbon economy
    presents challenges and potential economic benefits that are

### Climatech

How are large corporations responding to the climate crisis?

Lack of leadership. Capgemini (2022): “Many business leaders see
sustainability as costly obligation rather than investment in the
future”. Hoikkala (2019): for example the CEO of the Swedish clothing
producer H&M, one of the largest fast-fashion in the world, recognizes
the potential impact of conscious consumers as a threat.

Many large businesses have tried to find solutions by launching
climate-focused funding. (Korosec, 2021) reports that Amazon’s 2B USD to
a Climate Pledge Fund earmarked to fix climate problems is invested in
energy, logistics, and packaging startups, which will reduce material
waste. “Good intentions don’t work, mechanisms do,” Amazon’s founder
Bezos is quoted as saying in (Clifford, 2022). Walmart is taking a
similar approach, having launched a project in 2017 to set
CO<sub>2</sub> reduction targets in collaboration with its suppliers
Walmart (2023). These examples underlines how money marketed as climate
funding by retail conglomerates means focus on reducing operational cost
of running their business through automation and material savings.

Large corporations such as Nestle and Coca Cola support the biodiversity
law to have a level playing field for business (Greens EFA, 2023).

-   “Sustainability is important for many reasons including:
    Environmental Quality – In order to have healthy communities, we
    need clean air, natural resources, and a nontoxic environment.”

-   Low, S., Baum and Sovacool (2022) finds considerable uncertainty
    exists among experts which CO2 reduction methods among nature-based
    and technology-based are the most effective.

## *Measuring* Biosphere

Biosphere’s Ecological Indicators

Sustainability can be measured using a variety of ***ecological
indicators***.

Dinerstein et al. (2017) identifies 846 terrestrial ecoregions.

-   Svalbard Seed Vault
-   Jackson (1996) *preventive environmental management*
-   Jackson (2017) limits to growth update
-   Ecological Indicators (I like the name Ecomarkers) for Earth are
    like Biomarkers in human health.

Some argue sustainability is not enough and we should work on
regeneration of natural habitats.

## *Measuring* Ecosystem Services

Ecosystem services enable human life on Earth

(Gómez-Baggethun et al., 2010) the history of the valuation of nature’s
services goes back to the 18th century when David Ricardo and Jean
Baptiste Say discussed nature’s *work*, however both considered it
should be free. In 1997 (Daily, 1997) proposed the idea of ecosystem
services and (Costanza et al., 1997) attempted to assess the amount of
ecosystem services provided.

(Le Provost et al., 2022) study shows *biodiversity* as one key factor
to maintain delivery of ecosystem services. Noriega et al. (2018)
attempts to quantify the ecosystem services (ES) provided by insects.
While it can be assumed much of the flora and fauna are crucial for
Earth’s systems, science is still in the process of understanding and
quantifying its contributions.

-   Leverhulme Centre for Nature Recovery (2023) should we put a price
    on nature?
-   Bousfield et al. (2022) reports there’s evidence paying landowners
    for the ecosystem services their forests provide may reduce
    deforestation.
-   Is it time to leave utilitarian environmentalism behind? Muradian
    and Gómez-Baggethun (2021)

-   Han and Chen (2022) identifies nature-based solutions “land
    re-naturalization (such as afforestation and wetland restoration)”

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[4] }} />

-   Meanwhile the destruction pressure on ecosystems is rapidly
    increasing (ADD CITATION A B C).

-   Espinosa and Bazairi (2023) marine ecosystem services **(need
    access, ncku doesn’t sub)**

-   Chen et al. (2023) Ecosystem vulnerability **(need access)**

-   Zhang et al. (2023) Integrating ecosystem services conservation into
    urban planning **(need access)**

-   Li et al. (2023) tourism is a large industrial sector which relies
    on ecosystem services. In Taiwan, (Lee, Jan and Liu, 2021) developed
    a framework of indicators to assess sustainable tourism.

## ***Increasing*** **Environmental Degradation**

#### Growing Population and Overpopulation

Earth’s population reached 8 Billion people In November 2022 and
population projections by predict 8.5B people by 2030 and 9.7B by 2050
(The Economic Times, 2022; United Nations Department of Economic and
Social Affairs, Population Division, 2022). While population growth puts
higher pressure on Earth’s resources, some research proposes the effect
is more from wasteful lifestyles than the raw number of people
(Cardinale et al., 2012).(Hassoun et al., 2023) forecasts increase of
global food demand by 62% including impact of climate change.

-   Bowler et al. (2020) Anthropogenic Threat Complexes (ATCs):

-   “Overpopulation is a major cause of biodiversity loss and smaller
    human populations are necessary to preserve what is left” Cafaro,
    Hansson and Götmark (2022).

#### Marine Heatwaves

-   Gelles and Andreoni (2023) describe how marine heatwaves threaten
    global biodiversity.

#### Slavery Still Exists

In 2023, an estimated 50 million people are still in slavery around the
world; lack of supply chain visibility hides forced labor and
exploitation of undocumented migrants in agricultural work; 71% of
enslaved people are estimated to be women. (Borrelli et al., 2023; Kunz
et al., 2023).

The UN SDG target 8.7 targets to eliminate all forms of slavery.

Slavery is connected to environmental degradation and climate change
(Decker Sparks et al., 2021). Enslaved people are used in environmental
crimes such as 40% of deforestation globally. Cobalt used in
technological products is in risk of being produced under forced labor
in the D.R. Congo (Sovacool, 2021). In India and Pakistan, forced labor
in brick kiln farms is possible to capture remotely from satellite
images (Boyd et al., 2018). In effect, the need for cheap labor turns
slavery into a *subsidy* keeping environmental degradation happening.

-   Christ and V Helliar (2021) estimates 20 million people are stuck
    inside corporate blockchains. The Global Slavery Index measures the
    ***Import Risk*** of having slavery inside its imports Walk Free
    (2023).

-   Hans van Leeuwen (2023) slavery affects industries from fashion to
    technology, including sustainability enablers such as solar panels.

-   “commodification of human beings”

-   Anand Chandrasekhar and Andreas Gefe (2021): Trading commodities
    “Switzerland has a hand in over 50% of the global trade in coffee
    and vegetable oils like palm oil as well as 35% of the global volume
    of cocoa, according to government estimates.” Can traders have more
    scrutiny over what they trade?

-   Modern Slavery Act.

## *Losing* Biodiversity

Almond, R.E.A. et al. (2022) reported, the number of species killed,
mass destruction of nature. “69% decline in the relative abundance of
monitored wildlife populations around the world between 1970 and 2018.
Latin America shows the greatest regional decline in average population
abundance (94%), while freshwater species populations have seen the
greatest overall global decline (83%).”

```python
biodiversity_chart()
```

![](sustainability_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-3-output-1.png)

Biodiversity loss is linked to overconsumption, weak legislation and
lack of oversight. (Crenna, Sinkko and Sala, 2019) recounts European
Union consumers’ negative impact on biodiversity in countries where it
imports food. WWF (2022) case study highlights how 4 biodiverse regions
Cerrado in Brazil, Chaco in Argentina, Sumatra in Indonesia, and the
Cuvette Centrale in Democratic Republic of Congo are experiencing rapid
destruction due to consumer demand in the European Union. While the
European Union (EU) has recently become a leader in sustainability
legislation, biodiversity protection measures among private companies is
very low Marco-Fondevila and Álvarez-Etxeberría (2023).

Meanwhile, there is some progress in biodiversity conservation. UEBT
(2022) reports “Biodiversity awareness is now at 72% or higher in all
countries sampled, compared to only 29% or higher across countries
sampled in 2009.”

Similarly to climate protection, the UN has taken a leadership role in
biodiversity protection. Unit (2023): The history of the United Nations
Convention on Biodiversity goes back to 1988, when the working group was
founded. UNEP (Tue, 12/20/2022 - 07:44): The Convention on Biodiversity
2022 (COP15) adopted the first global biodiversity framework to
accompany climate goals.

Protecting biodiversity

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[5] }} />

#### ***Biodiversity Indicators***

Cutting edge research uses AI for listening to nature, assessing
biodiversity based on species’ sounds in the forest. Millions of
detections of different species with machine learning passive acoustic
AI models, can also assess species response to climate change (AI for
Good, 2023; Guerrero et al., 2023).

May (2011) argues biodiversity loss is a concern for 3 points of views:

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[6] }} />

#### Forest and Deforestion

Around 27% of Earth’s land area is still covered by forests yet
deforestation is widespread all around the world; highest rates of
deforestation happened in the tropical rainforests of South America and
Africa, mainly caused by agricultural cropland expansion (50% of all
deforestation) and grazing land for farm animals to produce meat
(38,5%), totaling close to 90% of global deforestation (Anon., 2022a).
Forests are a crucial part of Earth’s carbon cycle and the main natural
CO<sub>2</sub> capture system; due to deforestation, Europe rapidly
losing its forest carbon sink (Frédéric Simon, 2022).

Afforestation is different from reforestation, which takes into account
biodiversity.

-   Klosterman et al. (2022) using remote-sensing and machine-learning
    to assess reforestation potential; doesn’t take into account
    political realities.

-   1 billion tree project (Bastin et al., 2019; Anon., 2020; Greenfield
    and @pgreenfielduk, 2021)

-   Burning of biomass undermines carbon capture.

## Pollution

#### Air and Water Pollution is Widespread

-   Clean water and water pollution
-   Koch (2022) (**Need access! nyc times)**

Air pollution is widespread around the planet, with 99% of Earth’s human
population being affected by bad air quality that does not meet WHO air
quality guidelines, leading to health problems linked to 6.7 million
premature deaths every year World Health Organization (2022).
Grounbreaking research by Lim et al. (2022) analyzed over 400000
individuals in England, South Korea and Taiwan establishes exposure to
2.5μm PM (PM2.5) air pollution as a cause for lung cancer. Bouscasse et
al. (2022) finds strong health and economic benefits across the board
from air pollution reduction in France. In Hannah Devlin (2022), prof
Tony Mok, of the Chinese University of Hong Kong: “We have known about
the link between pollution and lung cancer for a long time, and we now
have a possible explanation for it. As consumption of fossil fuels goes
hand in hand with pollution and carbon emissions, we have a strong
mandate for tackling these issues – for both environmental and health
reasons”.

Health and sustainability are inextricably linked. “Human health is
central to all sustainability efforts.”, “All of these (food, housing,
power, and health care), and the stress that the lack of them generate,
play a huge role in our health” (Sarah Ludwig Rausch and Neha Pathak,
2021).

The main way to combat air pollution is through policy interventions.
MARIA LUÍS FERNANDES (2023) EU has legislation in progress to curb
industrial emissions. If legislation is in place, causing bad air
quality can become bad for business. Gu et al. (2023) links air
pollution to credit interest rates for business loans in China;
companies with low environmental awareness and a history of
environmental penalties pay 12 percent higher interest rates.

Clean air is a requirement.

#### Climate Change Disasters

-   A comprehensive review of evidence from paleoclimate records until
    current time, including ocean, atmosphere, and land surface of
    points towards substantial climate change if high levels of
    greenhouse gas emissions continue, termed by the authors as *climate
    sensitivity* (Sherwood et al., 2020).

-   (Anon., 2023b) The US Global Change Research Program comprehensive
    report to the US Congress links disaster-risk directly to global
    warming; for examples increased wildfires damage property, endanger
    life and reduces air quality, which in effect increases health
    challenges.

Environmental activists have been calling attention to global warming
for decades, yet the world has been slow to act (McKibben, 1989).

-   Flood risk mapping might lower property prices in at risk areas
    (Sherren, 2024).

-   In Taiwan disaster risk and hazard mapping, early warning systems,
    and comprehensive response save lives Tsai et al. (2021)

Global warming increases the risk of disasters and extreme weather
events. As extreme temperatures are increasingly commonplace, there’s
increased risk of wildfires (Volkova, Roxburgh and Weston, 2021).
Summers of 2022 and 2023 were the hottest on record so far, with extreme
heat waves recorded in places around the world (Douglas, 2023; Falconer,
2023; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), U.S.
Department of Commerce, 2023; NOAA National Centers for Environmental
Information, 2023; Serrano-Notivoli et al., 2023; Venturelli et al.,
2023). As temperatures rise, certain cities may become uninhabitable for
humans (CBC Radio, 2021). The summer of 2023 saw extensive wildfires in
Spain, Canada, and elsewhere; rapidly moving fires destroyed the whole
city of Lāhainā in Hawaii \[ADD CITATION\]. The part of Earth where the
*human climate niche* is becoming smaller (McKibben, 2023). Some parts
of South America have seen summer heat in the winter, with heatwaves
with temperatures as high as 38 degrees (Livingston, 2023).

-   Observed changes in heatwaves (Perkins-Kirkpatrick and Green, 2023).
-   Word Economic Forums Global Risks Report 2024 paints a bleak picture
    of the future with expectations of increased turbulence across the
    board based on a survey of over 1400 topic experts World Economic
    Forum (n.d.)

Climate-related disasters can spur action as extreme weather becomes
visible to everyone. After large floods in South Korea in July 2023 with
many victims, president Joon promised to begin taking global warming
seriously and steer the country towards climate action Web (2023); AFP
(2023); Al Jazeera (2023). South Korea has a partnership with the
European Union European Commission (2023a).

The fossil energy production that’s a large part of global CO2 emissions
has caused several high-profile pollution events. Large ones that got
international news coverage include Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon.

-   Chernobyl and Fukushima
-   the Great Pacific Garbage Patch
-   Lenton et al. (2023) quantifying human cost of global warming.
-   EJAtlas tracks environmental justice cases around the world Scheidel
    et al. (2020).
-   Disputes in Eerola (2022).

#### Pricing Climate Change

Long term cost is more than short-term gains.

#### Carbon Accounting in Corporate Industry

-   Watershed

-   The legislation has created an industry of CO<sub>2</sub> accounting
    with many companies like Greenly, Sustaxo, etc.

-   Quatrini (2021) sustainability assessments are complex and may give
    flawed results.

-   Nonetheles, CO<sub>2</sub> emission reduction has the added positive
    effect of boosting corporate morale (Cao, Li and Hasan, 2023).

## Mitigation & Adaption {#mitigation-adaption}

Many companies are developing technologies for mitigation.

#### Cap & Trade {#cap-trade}

The share of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions among people around the world is
highly unequal across the world (referred to as ***Carbon
Inequality***). (Chancel, 2022) reports “one-tenth of the global
population is responsible for nearly half of all emissions, half of the
population emits less than 12%”.

-   One example is the ICT sector.

-   Bajarin (n.d.) Over 300 million PCs sold in 2022

        of IT equipment”

    -   Zhou et al. (2022) ICT is an example of inequality, while
        emerging economies bear 82% of the emissions, developed
        countries gain 58% of value.

### Emissions’ Data

Data about green house gas emissions.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[7] }} />

“The world’s top 1% of emitters produce over 1000 times more CO2 than
the bottom 1%” IEA (2023a)

Crippa et al. (2020) reports latest figures from the EU’s Emissions
Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR)

The EU Copernicus satellite system reveals new greenhouse emissions
previously undetected (Daniel Värjö, 2022).

## *Trading* CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions

### Emissions Trading Schemes

From Carbon Offsets to Carbon Credits

Retiring CO<sub>2</sub> allowances

-   Facilitating citizens’ access to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions trading
    may be an efficient method to organize large-scale CO<sub>2</sub>
    retiring Rousse (2008)
-   “A carbon credit represents one tonne of carbon dioxide that has
    been prevented from entering or has been removed from the
    atmosphere” (Anna Watson, 2023; **annawatsonDeepDiveCarbon2022?**).

As of 2023 there isn’t a single global CO<sub>2</sub> trading market but
rather several local markets as described in the table below Anon.
(n.d.a).

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[8] }} />

Most of the world is not part of a CO<sub>2</sub> market.

-   (Sipthorpe et al., 2022) compares traditional and blockchain-based
    solutions to carbon trading.
-   (United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), 2021) report. “The
    Emissions Gap Report (EGR) 2021: The Heat Is On shows that new
    national climate pledges combined with other mitigation measures put
    the world on track for a global temperature rise of 2.7°C by the end
    of the century. That is well above the goals of the Paris climate
    agreement and would lead to catastrophic changes in the Earth’s
    climate. To keep global warming below 1.5°C this century, the
    aspirational goal of the Paris Agreement, the world needs to halve
    annual greenhouse gas emissions in the next eight years.
-   (United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), 2021) report “If
    implemented effectively, net-zero emissions pledges could limit
    warming to 2.2°C, closer to the well-below 2°C goal of the Paris
    Agreement. However, many national climate plans delay action until
    after 2030. The reduction of methane emissions from the fossil fuel,
    waste and agriculture sectors could help close the emissions gap and
    reduce warming in the short term, the report finds. Carbon markets
    could also help slash emissions. But that would only happen if rules
    are clearly defined and target actual reductions in emissions, while
    being supported by arrangements to track progress and provide
    transparency.”
-   (United Nations Environment Programme, 2022) 2022 Emissions Gap
    report.

### Carbon Markets

For the individual person, there’s no direct access to CO<sub>2</sub>
markets, however there are different types of brokers who buy large
amounts of carbon credits and resell them in smaller quantities to
retail investors. “Carbon pricing is not there to punish people,” says
Lion Hirth Lion Hirth (n.d.). “It’s there to remind us, when we take
travel, heating, consumption decisions that the true cost of fossil
fuels comprises not only mining and processing, but also the damage done
by the CO<sub>2</sub> they release.”

#### The Price of CO<sub>2</sub> Differs Across Markets

Stern (2022) reports carbon-neutral economy needs higher CO<sub>2</sub>
prices. Rennert et al. (2022): Carbon price should be 3,6x higher that
it is currently. Ritz (2022) argues optimal CO<sub>2</sub> prices could
be highly asymmetric, low in some countries and high (above the social
cost of CO<sub>2</sub>) in countries where production is very polluting.

-   iGenius (2020)
-   The total size of carbon markets reached 949 billion USD in 2023,
    including Chinese, European, and North American CO2e trading (LSEG
    and Susanna Twidale, 02/12/2024, 02:37 PM).

#### Compliance Markets

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[9] }} />

#### Voluntary Carbon Markets

Voluntary Carbon Markets are …

Voluntary Carbon Markets (VCM) lack standardization and transparency
(Ela Khodai, 2023).

***Carbon Credits*** are useful for private companies who wish to claim
*carbon neutrality, climate positivity*, or other related claim, which
might be viewed in good light by their clients or allow the companies to
adhere to certain legislative requirements.

There are many companies which facilitate buy carbon credits as well as
a few organizations focused on carbon credit verification.

-   In Estonia, startups Arbonic and Single.Earth are trialing this
    approach in several forests.
-   Carbon Credit Retirement?
-   Methodologies: Anon. (2022b)
-   KlimaDAO (2023) call for an open standard

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[10] }} />

#### Fossil Fuels

Fossil fuels are what powers humanity as well as the largest source of
CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. IEA (2022) reports “Global CO<sub>2</sub>
emissions from energy combustion and industrial processes rebounded in
2021 to reach their highest ever annual level. A 6% increase from 2020
pushed emissions to 36.3 gigatonnes”. As on June 2023, fossil fuel based
energy makes up 82% of energy and is still growing Institute (2023). The
425 largest fossil fuel projects represent a total of over 1 gigatons in
CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, 40% of which were new projects Kühne et al.
(2022). Tilsted et al. (2023) expects the fossil fuel industry to
continue grow even faster. In July 2023, the U.K. granted hundreds of
new oil and gas of project licenses in the North Sea (Anon., 2023d).

#### Renewable Energy

-   10 countries use almost 100% renewable energy

There’s ample evidence from several countries suggesting moving to
renewal energy brings environmental benefits:

-   Amin et al. (2022) suggests “removing fossil fuel subsidies and
    intra-sectoral electricity price distortions coupled with carbon
    taxes provides the highest benefits” for both the economy and the
    environment in Bangladesh.

-   Luo et al. (2022) suggests using reinforcement learning to reduce
    energy use in cooling systems.

-   The true cost of products is hidden. The work is hidden.

-   Montreal protocol eradicates CfCs and the ozone holes became whole
    again.

#### Emission Scopes Organize Calculating CO2e

The U.S. National Public Utilities Council (NPUC) decarbonization report
provides a useful categorization of ***emission scopes*** applicable to
companies and for organizing emission reduction schemes (National Public
Utilities Council, 2022). For example, for consumers in Australian
states and territories in 2018, 83% of the GHG emissions are Scope 3,
meaning indirect emissions in the value chain Goodwin et al. (2023).

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[11] }} />

One’s scope 3 emissions are someone else’s scope 1 emissions.

-   Mapping pollution sources in China Xie et al. (2021)

#### Carbon Capture

Many technology startups focused on climate solutions (often referred to
as climatech by the media), have proposed a range of approaches to
CO<sub>2</sub> reduction in the atmosphere.

-   Vitillo et al. (2022) illustrates how direct air capture of
    CO<sub>2</sub> is difficult because of low concentration and
    CO<sub>2</sub> capture at the source of the emissions is more
    feasible.

-   Gaure and Golombek (2022) simulate a CO<sub>2</sub> free electricity
    generation system in the European Union where “98% of total
    electricity production is generated by wind power and solar; the
    remainder is covered by a backup technology.”. The authors stipulate
    it’s possible to power the EU without producing CO<sub>2</sub>
    emissions.

-   **Important: “creating sustainability trust in companies in
    realtime”**

-   Howard et al. (2017) argues Oceans play crucial role in carbon
    capture.

#### Social Cost of Carbon Measures Compound CO<sub>2</sub> Impact

Sustainability is filled with complexities, where CO<sub>2</sub>
emission is compounded by biodiversity loss, child labor, slavery,
poverty, prostitution, dangerous chemicals, and many other issues become
intertwined (TEDx Talks, 2020). One attempt to measure these
complexities, is the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) which is defined as
“additional damage caused by an extra unit of emissions” (Zhen, Tian and
Ye, 2018; Kornek et al., 2021). For example the cost of damages caused
by “one extra ton of carbon dioxide emissions” (Stanford University,
2021). SCC variations exists between countries (Tol, 2019) and regions
(Wang, Y., Ma and Wang, 2022).

-   As shown in the Phillipines by (Cheng and Han, 2022), with
    increasing extreme weather events, “businesses are more likely to
    emerge in areas where infrastructure is resilient to climate
    hazards”. (Jerrett, Jina and Marlier, 2022) says, In California,
    “Wildfires are the second most important source of emissions in
    2020” and “Wildfires in 2020 negate reductions in greenhouse gas
    emissions from other sectors.”

-   (Lin et al., 2022) says, apart from CO<sub>2</sub>, reduction of
    other atmospheric pollutants, such as non-CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse
    gases (GHGs) and short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) is required
    for climate stability.

## Eco-Design

***Designing for Sustainability aka Circular Design or Eco-Design***
encompasses all human activities, making this pursuit an over-arching
challenge across all industries also known as circular economy. Assuming
that as individuals we want to act in a sustainable way, how exactly
would be go about doing that?

-   “Evolution of design for sustainability: From product design to
    design for system innovations and transitions”

-   de Otazu et al. (2022) **Life Cycle Assessment and environmental
    impact analysis are needed to provide eco-design scenarios.**

-   European Parliament (2022) proposal “On 30 March 2022, the European
    Commission put forward a proposal for a regulation establishing a
    general framework for setting eco-design requirements for
    sustainable products, repealing rules currently in force which
    concentrate on energy-related products only.” Virginijus
    Sinkevičius, EU Commissioner for the Environment, Oceans and
    Fisheries, is quoted as describing eco-design “respects the
    boundaries of our planet” European Commission (2022a)

-   Forming an emotional bond with the product makes it feel more
    valuable (Zonneveld and Biggemann, 2014). This has implications for
    sustainability as the object is less likely to be thrown away.

### Regenerative design

-   Dematerialize economies is not enough.

### Biomimicry

-   following nature

### Biodesign

MIT is a source of many fantastic innovations.

-   Neri Oxman, biomaterials MIT media lab, 15. sept. 2020

-   Neri Oxman’s expressions: “ecology-indifferent”, “naturing”, “mother
    naturing”, “design is a practice of letting go of all that is
    unnecessary”, “nature should be our single client”.

-   Use imagination

-   Societal movements change things: implication for design: build a
    community

-   Processes sustain things: implication for design: built an app

### AI-Assisted Design Enables Desiging for Sustainability

Gupta et al. (2023) argues software is key to building more sustainable
products, already for decades. More recently, companies like AutoDesk
are putting CO<sub>2</sub> calculations inside their design software.

-   AI has the potential to provide the parameters for sustainability.
    Singh and Sarkar (2023) proposes an AI tool for deciding the
    suitable life cycle design parameters.
-   Anon. (n.d.b): “Sustainability starts in the design process, and AI
    can help”.

### Circular Economy

Circular economy is a tiny part of the world economy. Circle Economy
(2022) reports only 8.6% of world economy is circular and *100B tonnes
of virgin materials* are sourced every year.

-   McGinty (Thu, 08/06/2020 - 11:25): How to Build a Circular Economy

-   Dull (2021) book

-   Chapman (2009) argues in his seminal paper (and later in his book)
    for ***“Emotionally Durable Design”***, the simple idea that we hold
    to things we value and thus they are sustainable. We don’t throw
    away a necklace gifted to us by mom, indeed this object might be
    passed down for centuries. Rose (2015) has a similar idea, where
    ***“Enchanted Objects”*** become so interlinked with us, we’re
    unlikely to throw them away.

-   Growing public understanding of how nature works and intersects with
    our use of money.

-   Hedberg and Šipka (2021) argues digitization and data sharing is a
    requirement for building a circular economy.

## Policy Context

-   “In the context of the EU Plastics Strategy, the European Commission
    has launched a pledge to increase the use of recycled content to 10
    million tons by 2025. To address this, Circularise Plastics Group
    launched an “Open Standard for Sustainability and Transparency”

### The Policy Context in Europe From 2023 to 2030

````mdx-code-block
<Figure
  caption="EU Policy Context Timeline'"
  src={EUPolicy}
/>
````

We have an opportunity to re-imagine how every product can be an
eco-product and how they circulate in our circular economy.

Timeline of the Policy Context:

-   In 2019 by the von der Leyen commission adopted the European Union
    (EU) **Green Deal** strategy.

-   In 2021 the Commision proposed a goal of reducing CO2e emissions by
    55% by 2030 under the *Fit for 55* policy package consisting of a
    wide range of economic measures.

-   In November 2022, the proposal was adopted by the EU Council and EU
    Parliament with an updated goal of 57% of CO2e reductions compared
    to 1990. This proposal is set to become a binding law for all EU
    member countries (European Commission (2019a); European Commission
    (2019b); Anon. (2022c); European Council (2022)).

-   In March 2022, the EU Circular Economy Action Plan was adopted,
    looking to make sustainable products *the norm* in EU and
    *empowering consumers* as described in European Commission (2022b).
    Each product covered by the policy is required to have a ***Digital
    Product Passport*** which enables improved processing within the
    supply chain and includes detailed information to empower consumers
    to understand the environmental footprint of their purchases. It’s
    safe to say the large majority of products available today do not
    meet these criteria.

### European Green Deal

-   Anon. (2021b)
-   Switch2Green (2023)

It’s up to legislators to provide sustainable products on our
marketplace… but until we do, use the green filter.

-   One of the EU goals is reducing consumption
-   Tacking our consumption habits
-   Europe is the hotbed of sustainability
-   Iman Ghosh (2020)
-   Lamoureux (2018) Florida sustainable companies
-   MICHAEL HOULIHAN and BONNIE HARVEY (2018) customers prefer
    sustainable companies
-   Rajagopalan and Landrigan (2023): In the US, the *Inflation
    Reduction Act* provides funding to development of decarbonizing
    technologies and includes plans to combat air pollution, reduce
    green house gases and address environmental injustices.

### Eco-Design is a Key EU Sustainable Policy Design Tool

A large part of the proposal by Commission et al. (2014) is
***eco-design***, as a large part of product lifecycle environmental
impact is defined in the design process.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[13] }} />

### Sustainbility Policy is Shifting Around the World

Politics matters in sustainability.

In the European Union (EU), a wide range of legislative proposals,
targets, organizations, and goals already exists across diverse
countries. Upcoming laws aim to harmonize approaches to sustainability
and raise standards for all members states, in turn influencing
producers who wish to sell in the EU common market.

-   In Brazil, deforestation fell 60% in 1 year, based on remote
    satellite reconnaissance, after the election of a more
    pro-environment leadership Watts (2023).

-   Anon. (n.d.c) report: The EU has a ***taxonomy of environmentally
    sustainable economic activities*** published by the Technical Expert
    Group (TEG) on sustainable finance.

-   The proposal for a Nature Restoration Law by the European Commission
    requiring member countries to restore 20% of EU’s degraded
    ecosystems by 2030 and full restoration by 2050 has not yet passed
    Anon. (2023e) and is facing a backlash David Pinto (2023).

-   Rossi, Cappelletti and Germani (2022) shows how introducing
    sustainability early in the design process and providing scenarios
    where sustainability is a metric, it’s possible to achieve more
    eco-friendly designs.

## *Increasing* Waste Generation

Liu et al. (2023) reports, e–waste is growing 3%–5% every year,
globally. (Thukral and Singh, 2023) identifies several barriers to
e-waste management among producers including lack of awareness and
infrastructure, attitudinal barriers, existing *informal* e-waste
sector, and the need for an e-waste license.

### Extended Producer Responsibility Enables Companies to be Resposible

Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is a policy tool first proposed
by Thomas Lindhqvist in Sweden in 1990 \[ADD CITATION\], aimed to
encourage producers take responsibility for the entire life-cycle of
their products, thus leading to more eco-friendly products. Nonetheless,
EPR schemes do not guarantee circularity and may instead be designed
around fees to finance waste management in linear economy models
(Christiansen, Hasse and Tønder, 2021). The French EPR scheme was
upgraded in 2020 to become more circular (Jacques Vernier, 2021). In
July 2024, Latvia was the 4th EU country to join an textile-EPR scheme
(Anon., 2024c).

In any case, strong consumer legislation (such as EPR) has a direct
influence on producers’ actions. For example, in HKTDC Research (2022),
the Hong Kong Trade Development Council notified textile producers in
July 2022 reminding factories to produce to French standards in order to
be able enter the EU market. Peng, Shi and Tong (2023) finds that the
***Carbon Disclosure Project*** has been a crucial tool to empower ERP
in Chinese auto-producers.

-   The success of EPR can vary per type of product. For car tires, the
    EPR scheme in the Netherlands claims a 100% recovery rate
    Campbell-Johnston et al. (2020).

One type of legislation that works?

-   Steenmans and Ulfbeck (2023) Argues for the need to engage companies
    through legislation and shift from waste-centered laws to product
    design regulations.

-   In Europe, there’s large variance between member states when in
    comes to textile recycling: while Estonia and France are the only EU
    countries where separate collection of textiles is required by law,
    in Estonia 100% of the textiles were burned in an incinerator in
    2018 while in France textiles are covered by an Extended Producer
    Responsibility (EPR) scheme leading to higher recovery rates (Ibid).

### Return, Repair, Reuse

-   There’s a growing number of companies providing re-use of existing
    items.
-   Anon. (n.d.d) For example, Swap furniture in Estonia

Bring back your bottle and cup after use.

-   Ruiz-Pastor and Mesa (2023) proposes a **product repairability index
    (PRI)**
-   Formentini and Ramanujan (2023)
-   Recycling (Lenovo, 08-29-22) “rethinking product design and
    inspiring consumers to expect more from their devices”
-   “design is a tool to make complexity comprehensible” like the
    Helsinki chapel. there’s either or a priest or a social worker. it’s
    the perfect public service. “limit the barrier of entry for people
    to discover”. elegant.
-   Zeynep Falay von Flittner (n.d.)

### Packaging

Packaging is a rapidly growing industry which generates large amounts of
waste Ada et al. (2023). Bradley and Corsini (2023): “Over 161 million
tonnes of plastic packaging is produced annually.”

-   Anon. (2022d)
-   Anon. (2022e)
-   Anon. (2010)
-   (Lerner, 2019) Coca Cola plastic pollution. ESG ratings have faced
    criticism for lack of standards and failing to account for the
    comprehensive impact a company is having. (Foley et al., 2024) notes
    how Coca Cola fails to account the supply chain water usage when
    reporting becoming “water neutral” and calls on companies to release
    more detailed information.
-   Anon. (n.d.e)

### Factories Can Become More Transparent
