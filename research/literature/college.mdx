## Student Protests Around the World

In August 2018, Swedish high-school student Greta Thunberg skipped class
to start a climate strike in front of the Swedish parliament Riksdag.
Millions of people around the world joined her *Fridays for Future*
protests. Time magazine named Thunberg person of the year for *creating
a global attitudinal shift* (Deutsche Welle, 2019).

## College Students in Taiwan

(Chang, Wegerif and Hennessy, 2023) argues Taiwanese culture is
influenced by Confucianism and Daoism, which affect education to be
***teacher-centered***, where traditionally the role of students is to
listen and absorb knowledge; there are open opportunities to revisit
***dialogue-based*** education, where students would be encouraged to
take a more active role and gain ownership of their education.

Taiwan has an aging population (Goh et al., 2023).

### Teachers

-   Elementary-school teachers in Taichung (n=536), have positive
    attitudes towards environmental education are positive, proactive
    and demonstrate high awareness; they have participated in many
    sustainability-related workshops (Liao et al., 2022). Taiwanese
    government launched the Sustainable Council in 1997 to promote of
    environmental and sustainable development; a survey of
    university-level teachers (n=100) in central Taiwan (Taichung,
    Changhua, and Yunlin) shows a positive attitude toward environmental
    sustainability among teachers however implementation of
    environmental sustainability practices is from low to medium range
    (林美惠. and 莊, 2015).

### Policy Environment

-   Comparing university students’ education for sustainable development
    (ESD) in Taiwan (n=617) and Sweden (n=583); Sweden has a long
    history in environmental education while in Taiwan environment
    became a focus area with the 1998 educational reform Berglund et al.
    (2020).

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[0] }} />

-   Several Taiwanese studies focus on the physical environment of
    school campuses, for example the sustainability of **elementary
    school campuses** (潘智謙 and Chih-Chien, 2006).

-   The devastating nuclear disaster in Fukushima, Japan, after 2011
    earthquake, had an effect on Taiwanese energy and sustainability
    education (姚 and 侯, 2011).

### Students

-   (陳, 2003) reports *good knowledge of sustainable development*
    topics among **junior high school students** in Da-an District,
    Taipei City (n=596). (林建輝., 2009) similarly reports a positive
    attitude and good knowledge of environmental sustainable development
    among senior **high school students** towards in Taipei City
    (n=328). (Chen and Tsai, 2016) reports a ***positive attitude yet
    moderate knowledge*** about *ocean sustainability* among Taiwanese
    **college students** (n=825).

-   (Liu et al., 2023) studied sustainability behavior of Taiwanese
    University students reporting the COVID-19 pandemic also brought
    more attention on environmental topics .

-   When it comes to learning about environmental issues at the
    pre-university level, Taiwanese government has been promoting green
    schools through a green school network; however surveys at middle
    school and high school level suggest there is no impact on
    *sustainability consciousness* among students in comparison with
    regular schools (Olsson et al., 2019). Rather, Taiwanese students
    are influenced towards environmental action by *group consciousness*
    (Yu, Yu and Chao, 2017).

-   I was unable to find similar research on university and
    post-graduate level students in Taiwan.

-   Taiwanese college students and SDGs (Ho et al., 2022).

### Global Data

-   (Manchanda et al., 2023) survey (n=726) administered at shopping
    malls in New Delhi, India, found similar levels of sustainability
    consciousness between Millenial (n=206) and Generation-Z (n=360) age
    groups; people with high level of materialism were found to be less
    sustainability-conscious; the effect of mindfulness on
    sustainability was found to be stronger among females than males,
    supporting the hypothesis of the moderating effect of gender.

**There’s evidence young people have money.** In the United States, the
combined annual consumer spending of generation-z and millennials was
over 2.5 Trillion USD in 2020 (YPulse, 2020). Over the decade from 2020
to 2030, in the U.S., UK, and Australia, Millennials are projected to
inherit 30 trillion USD from their parents (Calastone, 2020). There’s
also some evidence of investment interest, however there’s large
geographic variance. According to a (Calastone, 2020) study (n=3000)
surveying people in the millennial age group between ages 23 and 35 in
Europe (UK, France, Germany), U.S.A., Hong Kong, and Australia, 48% of
respondents located in Hong Kong owned financial securities (such as
stocks) while the figure was just 10% in France.

| Place     | Percentage of Financial Security Ownerneship |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------|
| Hong Kong | 48%                                          |
| France    | 10%                                          |
|           |                                              |

From millennial investors (Calastone, 2020).

### Sustainability Tools in the Taiwanese Context

Musical garbage truck are a success story of the environmental progress
in Taiwan (Helen Davidson and Chi Hui Lin, 2022). Indeed, they are a
*user interface innovation* and the main way how people in Taiwan
interact with sustainability issues.

The popular narrative about Taiwan recounts the story of the economic
and environmental transformation of the country. In the late 1980s
during the heights of an economic boom Taiwan became famous as the
Taiwanese Miracle (臺灣奇蹟) (Gold, 1986; Tsai, 1999). By the early
1990s another less flattering nickname appeared: “garbage island”, for
the piles of trash covering the streets and overflowing landfills (Rapid
Transitions Alliance, 2019; Ngo, 2020). In the two decades that
followed, from 1998 to 2018, Taiwan made progress in municipal waste
management, rising to the status of a world-leader in recycling (2nd
*effective recycling rate* after Germany); in addition to an effective
recycling system, the average waste amount generated per person by 700g
(from 1140g to 400g) per day; nonetheless, industrial recycling rates
were less stellar, standing at 80% in 2020 and there were unrealized
opportunities in using industry 4.0 technologies, such as internet of
things (IoT) sensors for better waste tracking (Wu, Hu and Ni, 2021; Bui
et al., 2023).

Progress in sustainability is possible but achieving results takes time
and innovation. (Rapid Transitions Alliance, 2019) credits the Taiwanese
Homemakers United Foundation (財團法人主婦聯盟環境保護基金會) for
initiating the transformation in 1987, suggesting a small group of
people can have an outsized impact on the whole country. Their activity
didn’t stop there and (財團法人主婦聯盟環境保護基金會, 2020) recounts a
timeline of their achievements on their website until the present day.

-   Progress in other areas of environmental protection has not made
    similar progress.

-   There are documentaries about oil product

-   Plastic production documentary

-   I’ve seen several.. find and cite them to show the progression of
    the environmental movement in Taiwan ADD CITATION

### Developing Personas

User research makes extensive use of user *personas* to represent a
group of people with similar attributes. Designers use personas to
*articulate assumptions,* which, if used well, is useful for
*user-centered design*, to create better products. Personas help to
reflect on what kind of *biases* might exist in the design. Within the
larger cohort of college students several different personas could be
defined, for example grouping people by interests, knowledge, habits,
levels of anxiety, and other attributes.

Humans have a long list of cognitive biases, which a good design should
take into account.

There is extensive research on the attitudes of U.S. college students
towards climate change. (American Press Institute, 2022) reports only
37% percent of U.S. Generation-Z and Millenials follow news related to
environmental issues. (Schwartz et al., 2022) reports some adult US
students in a small study (18-35, n = 284) express feelings of
insignificance of their actions to achieve any meaningful impact.
(Thomaes et al., 2023) reports U.S. adolescents don’t find
sustainability relevant to their daily life. (Ross et al., 2016) says
most people in the U.S. don’t act on climate change. “Action on climate
change has been compromised by uncertainty, aspects of human
psychology”.

-   Students in the Generation-Z age bracket (abbreviated as Gen-Z or
    Zoomers) are born between 1997 and 2012 (Branka Vuleta, 2023). Over
    98% of Gen-Z owns a smartphone while only 80% of the general world
    population does (Global Web Index, 2017; BankMyCell, 2022).

-   High levels of technology adoption worldwide

-   (Credit Suisse, 2022) suggests young consumers are more eco-friendly
    and drive the speed of change. Yet the Economist has ran a few
    anonymous articles calling gen-z green ideals into question (Anon.,
    2023; The Economist, 2023).

-   Deyan Georgiev (2023)

-   Alex Reice (2021)

The above studies give foundation for creating a persona of a U.S.
College Student who doesn’t follow environmental news and thinks climate
action doesn’t make a difference. This doesn’t necessarily mean this
group of people with similar ideas would deny climate change is
happening. Rather “Climate Denier” could be another persona, grouping
people into a cohort who thinks climate change is not real. Further
research would be needed to define relevant personas which have
meaningful predictive and generalizing power.

| Description           | Name  | Beliefs                       |
|-----------------------|-------|-------------------------------|
| Climate Change Denier | Jake  | Climate change doesn’t exist. |
|                       | Alice |                               |
|                       | Sam   |                               |

Rooney-Varga et al. (2019) shows the effectiveness of ***The Climate
Action Simulation*** in educating users about **success scenarios**.

### Social Trust

-   When disaster hits we need high levels of social trust.

### Climate Anxiety

A large worldwide study (n=10000, age 16-25) by (Hickman et al., 2021)
provides evidence the youth is anxious about climate in Australia,
Brazil, Finland, France, India, Nigeria, Philippines, Portugal, the UK,
and the USA. Similarly, (Thompson, 2021) finds young people around the
world have climate anxiety. (Whitmarsh et al., 2022) shows worry about
the climate in the UK is generally widespread (over 40% of the
respondents, n=1332), while climate anxiety is highest among young
people and is a possible motivator for climate action. Additionally,
(Ogunbode et al., 2022) finds climate anxiety in 32 countries and also
supports the idea that climate anxiety leads to climate activism.
(Thibodeau, 2022): “In 2021, the BBC polled 1,000 people in Scotland to
understand the barriers to taking climate action. What they found was
even though many people were aware of actions needed to take to address
climate change, and had intentions to their behaviors didn’t change.
This is a phenomenon called the intention-action gap.”

-   Designing for Health and Sustainability: Health and sustainability
    are intrinsically connected. (Kjrgård, Land and Bransholm
    Pedersen, 2014) shows how “understanding health and sustainability
    as a duality, health both creates conditions and is conditioned by
    sustainability, understood as economic, social and environmental
    sustainability, while on the other hand sustainability creates and
    is conditioned by human health”

-   Design for Human Rights (UNFCCC, 2023)\] text refers to “human right
    to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment”.

-   Refi podcast: “people need agency”.

-   Martiskainen et al. (2020) (need access, ncku doesn’t subscribe)

-   Seabrook (2020) (need access)

-   Older research on young adults (Millenials at the time) highlights
    how Millenials “use Google as a reference point for ease of use and
    simplicity” (Kate Moran, 2016).

### Embodied Carbon

### Community

Humans working together are able to achieve more than single
individuals. “Any community on the internet should be able to come
together, with capital, and work towards any shared vision. That starts
with empowering creators and artists to create and own the culture
they’re creating. In the long term this moves to internet communities
taking on societal endeavors.”

-   Building a culture of sustainability? (Lakshmi Rebecca, 2018;
    Armstrong and Staff, 2021).

The focus on *group consciousness* suggests community-based
sustainability action may be effective.

***Zero Waste Lifestyle*** is the opposite of overconsumption. Zero
waste suggests people buy in bulk to save. Buying in bulk for more
savings and to reduce packaging. Through group purchases and community
investing while also reducing consumption. - Zero waste municipality in
Treviso

***Minimalism*** is a movement of people living a simple life. This is
always going to be a small percentage of people. (Costa, 2018): Finnish
socialists: minimalism. Tokyo (Tokyo Simple Eco Life, 2021).

What are the building blocks of a thriving community?

### Empowerment

-   I would like to have an AI agent to set my requirements and
    preferences and give a “fuck you” middle finger to companies that
    don’t meet them. I could also give a thumbs up to companies that
    meet my expectations. Perhaps the user interface could like Tinder
    where I can swipe left and right.

### Trust

-   plap

### Memes

-   Coined by Richard Dawkins in 1976 in the context of biology.

-   Internet memes and meme stocks

-   Memes from daily life, business to war, are relevant to penetrating
    through the noise of the web.

-   Memes and sustainability?

-   Meme research has become an academic discipline

-   Memes have become a popular communication tool..

Interacting with the user is on the rise. For example, Chime makes tipping suggestions on the place of purchase.                                                                                                                                                                           |
|                 | The demographics that stand to win the most from the green transformation of business are the youngest generations, with more years of life ahead of them, and more exposure to future environmental and social risks. It would be advisable for Generation Z and their parents (Millennials) to invest their resources in greener assets, however, it’s still difficult to pick and choose between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ financial vehicles to invest in. |
|                 | This creates an opportunity for a new generation of sustainable investment apps, focusing on the usability and accessibility of ESG for a mainstream audience. Generation Z and Millennials expect a consumer-grade user experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|                 | What would that experience look like? I’ve chosen these demographics with the assumption that if given the right tools, the emotional demand for sustainability could be transformed into action. The exploration of systems of feedback to enable consumers to apply more direct positive and negative pressure to the businesses and consumers signal consequences for undesirable ecological performance is a major motivation of this study.      |
