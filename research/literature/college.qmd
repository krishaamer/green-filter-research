## College Students

This research focuses on developing an AI companion for ***college students***.

### Personas

User research makes extensive use of user ***personas*** to represent a group of people with similar attributes. Designers use personas to ***articulate assumptions,*** which is useful for ***user-centered design*** and also to reflect on what kind of ***biases*** might exist in the design. Within the larger cohort of College Students several different personas could be defined, for example grouping people by interests, knowledge, habits, levels of anxiety, and other attributes.

Humans have a long list of cognitive biases, which a good design should take into account.

There is extensive research on the attitudes of U.S. college students towards climate change. @americanpressinstituteKnowingNewsHow2022 reports only 37% percent of U.S. Generation-Z and Millenials follow news related to environmental issues. @schwartzClimateChangeAnxiety2022 reports some adult US students in a small study (18-35, N = 284) express feelings of insignificance of their actions to achieve any meaningful impact. @thomaesGreenTeensUnderstanding2023 reports U.S. adolescents don't find sustainability relevant to their daily life. @rossClimateChangeChallenge2016 says most people in the U.S. don't act on climate change. "Action on climate change has been compromised by uncertainty, aspects of human psychology".

The above studies give foundation for creating a persona of a U.S. College Student who doesn't follow environmental news and thinks climate action doesn't make a difference. This doesn't necessarily mean this group of people with similar ideas would deny climate change is happening. Rather "Climate Denier" could be another persona, grouping people into a cohort who thinks climate change is not real. Further research would be needed to define relevant personas which have meaningful predictive and generalizing power.

| Description           | Name  | Beliefs                       |
|-----------------------|-------|-------------------------------|
| Climate Change Denier | Jake  | Climate change doesn't exist. |
|                       | Alice |                               |
|                       | Sam   |                               |

@RooneyVargaClimateActionSimulation2019 shows the effectiveness of ***The Climate Action Simulation*** in educating users about **success scenarios**.

### Social Trust

-   When disaster hits we need high levels of social trust.

### Climate Anxiety

A large @hickmanClimateAnxietyChildren2021 worldwide study (n=10000, aged 16-25) provides evidence the youth is anxious about climate in Australia, Brazil, Finland, France, India, Nigeria, Philippines, Portugal, the UK, and the USA. Similarly, @thompsonYoungPeopleClimate2021 finds young people around the world have climate anxiety. @whitmarshClimateAnxietyWhat2022 shows worry about the climate in the UK is generally widespread (over 40% of the respondents, n=1332), while climate anxiety is highest among young people and is a possible motivator for climate action. Additionally, @ogunbodeClimateAnxietyWellbeing2022 finds climate anxiety in 32 countries and also supports the idea that climate anxiety leads to climate activism. @thibodeauThreeCompaniesClosing2022: "In 2021, the BBC polled 1,000 people in Scotland to understand the barriers to taking climate action. What they found was even though many people were aware of actions needed to take to address climate change, and had intentions to their behaviors didn't change. This is a phenomenon called the intention-action gap."

-   Designing for Health and Sustainability: Health and sustainability are intrinsically connected. @kjaergardHealthSustainability2014 shows how *"understanding health and sustainability as a duality, health both creates conditions and is conditioned by sustainability, understood as economic, social and environmental sustainability, while on the other hand sustainability creates and is conditioned by human health"*

-   Design for Human Rights @unfcccSharmElSheikhImplementation2023 text refers to "human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment".

-   Refi podcast: "people need agency".

-   Older research on young adults (Millenials at the time) highlights how Millenials "use Google as a reference point for ease of use and simplicity" @katemoranDesigningYoungAdults2016.

### Community

Humans working together are able to achieve more than single individuals. "Any community on the internet should be able to come together, with capital, and work towards any shared vision. That starts with empowering creators and artists to create and own the culture they're creating. In the long term this moves to internet communities taking on societal endeavors."

-   Building a culture of sustainability? @lakshmirebeccaManWhoGamifying2018; @armstrongCultivatingCulturesSustainability2021

***Zero Waste Lifestyle*** is the opposite of overconsumption. Zero waste suggests people buy in bulk to save. Buying in bulk for more savings and to reduce packaging. Through group purchases and community investing while also reducing consumption.

***Minimalism*** is a movement of people living a simple life. This is always going to be a small percentage of people. @costaHowFinnishCulture2018: Finnish socialists: minimalism. Tokyo @tokyosimpleecolifeWhatLearnedMy2021.

### Empowerment

-   I would like to have an AI agent to set my requirements and preferences and give a "fuck you" middle finger to companies that don't meet them. I could also give a thumbs up to companies that meet my expectations. Perhaps the user interface could like Tinder where I can swipe left and right.

### Trust

### Memes

-   Coined by Richard Dawkins in 1976 in the context of biology.

-   Internet memes and meme stocks

-   Memes from daily life, business to war, are relevant to penetrating through the noise of the web.

-   Memes and sustainability?

-   Meme research has become an academic discipline

-   Memes have become a popular communication tool..

## Design Implications

-   Community

    -   People exist in relation to other people.

    -   Psychology of 'fundraising clubs' vs individual investing

    -   @UkraineDAOBiddingUkrainian Ukraine DAO to support Ukraine through web3.

    -   These social movements are small and require too much effort to be feasible for the app? Most college students are not zero waste or minimalist.

    -   Group Purchases.

    -   Find Your Composting Community.

    -   Provides a community for pooling money with like-minded investors.

-   Climate Anxiety

    -   How to support the youth? Design to reduce climate anxiety? Is getting people to go to nature more a good way to increase ecological awareness? Empowered by Design. Youth empowerment: The design should empower young people.

    -   Consumer branded carbon credits like angry teenagers?

    -   Invest time not money, student don't have money?

-   Social Trust

    -   **Show Success Scenarios!**

    -   Ask how much time you want to contribute.

    -   Match with other people based on time.

    -   Create a group chatroom.

    -   Use AI to help out with tips.

    -   Ask university students what do they study and match with that industry to become expert and sustainability leader in this field.

    -   People want to help and make a difference. Give people things to do. The @dontlookupMethodology part of the ***Don't Look Up*** movie's social campaign provides 5 user models / roles for the audience to follow: Consumer, Investor, Activist.

    -   Choose Your Climate Solutions.

    -   Younger people show higher motivation (participants in climate protests). How to be relevant for a younger audience?

    -   Yet action remains low.

    -   Targeted and gated to college students.

    -   FB, etc, Gas all had the same launch strategy - start with students

    -   @kuzminskiEcologyMoneyDebt2015 ecology of money

    -   Young people are mobile-first.

    -   Persona: I care mostly about... fashion, art, ...

    -   Young people like to follow trends.

    -   Food ordering apps are popular.

    -   Monoculture -\> regenerative food forests Oil -\> electric cars / bicycles.

    -   Mobile-first.

    -   Social

    -   Educational

    -   Edutainment

    -   Fun

    -   @aespaAespaEseupaMY2020: Karina from Korea. It makes sense your sustainability assistant would talk to you. Studies show gen N is speaking to computers all the time. Interacting with the user is on the rise. For example, Chime makes tipping suggestions on the place of purchase.

    -   The demographics that stand to win the most from the green transformation of business are the youngest generations, with more years of life ahead of them, and more exposure to future environmental and social risks. It would be advisable for Generation Z and their parents (Millennials) to invest their resources in greener assets, however, it's still difficult to pick and choose between 'good' and 'bad' financial vehicles to invest in.

    -   This creates an opportunity for a new generation of sustainable investment apps, focusing on the usability and accessibility of ESG for a mainstream audience. Generation Z and Millennials expect a consumer-grade user experience.

    -   What would that experience look like? I've chosen these demographics with the assumption that if given the right tools, the emotional demand for sustainability could be transformed into action. The exploration of systems of feedback to enable consumers to apply more direct positive and negative pressure to the businesses and consumers signal consequences for undesirable ecological performance is a major motivation of this study.
