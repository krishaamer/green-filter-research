## Student Protests Around the World

In August 2018, Swedish high-school student Greta Thunberg skipped class to start a climate strike in front of the Swedish parliament Riksdag. Millions of people around the world joined her *Fridays for Future* protests. Time magazine named Thunberg person of the year for *creating a global attitudinal shift* [@deutschewelleFridaysFutureGlobal2019].

## College Students in Taiwan

[@changExploringDialogicEducation2023] argues Taiwanese culture is influenced by Confucianism and Daoism, which affect education to be ***teacher-centered***, where traditionally the role of students is to listen and absorb knowledge; there are open opportunities to revisit ***dialogue-based*** education, where students would be encouraged to take a more active role and gain ownership of their education.

Taiwan has an aging population [@gohLongrunMacroeconomicConsequences2023].

### Teachers

-   Elementary-school teachers in Taichung (n=536), have positive attitudes towards environmental education are positive, proactive and demonstrate high awareness; they have participated in many sustainability-related workshops [@liaoElementaryTeachersEnvironmental2022]. Taiwanese government launched the Sustainable Council in 1997 to promote of environmental and sustainable development; a survey of university-level teachers (n=100) in central Taiwan (Taichung, Changhua, and Yunlin) shows a positive attitude toward environmental sustainability among teachers however implementation of environmental sustainability practices is from low to medium range [@FenXi2015].

### Students

-   [@GuoZhongXueShengWeiLi2003] reports *good knowledge of sustainable development* topics among **junior high school students** in Da-an District, Taipei City (n=596). [@GaoZhongXueShengWeiLi2009] similarly reports a positive attitude and good knowledge of environmental sustainable development among senior **high school students** towards in Taipei City (n=328). [@chenMarineEnvironmentalAwareness2016] reports a ***positive attitude yet moderate knowledge*** about *ocean sustainability* among Taiwanese **college students** (n=825).

-   When it comes to learning about environmental issues at the pre-university level, Taiwanese government has been promoting green schools through a green school network; however surveys at middle school and high school level suggest there is no impact on *sustainability consciousness* among students in comparison with regular schools [@olssonGreenSchoolsTaiwan2019]. Rather, Taiwanese students are influenced towards environmental action by *group consciousness* [@yuUnderstandingTaiwaneseUndergraduate2017].

-   I was unable to find similar research on university and post-graduate level students in Taiwan.

-   Taiwanese college students and SDGs [@hoImportancePerformanceSDGs2022].

### Global Data

-   [@manchandaCultivatingSustainabilityConsciousness2023] survey (n=726) administered at shopping malls in New Delhi, India, found similar levels of sustainability consciousness between Millenial (n=206) and Generation-Z (n=360) age groups; people with high level of materialism were found to be less sustainability-conscious; the effect of mindfulness on sustainability was found to be stronger among females than males, supporting the hypothesis of the moderating effect of gender.

**There's evidence young people have money.** In the United States, the combined annual consumer spending of generation-z and millennials was over 2.5 Trillion USD in 2020 [@ypulseMillennialsGenTeens2020]. Over the decade from 2020 to 2030, in the U.S., UK, and Australia, Millennials are projected to inherit 30 trillion USD from their parents [@calastoneMillennialsInvestingDetailed2020]. There's also some evidence of investment interest, however there's large geographic variance. According to a [@calastoneMillennialsInvestingDetailed2020] study (n=3000) surveying people in the millennial age group between ages 23 and 35 in Europe (UK, France, Germany), U.S.A., Hong Kong, and Australia, 48% of respondents located in Hong Kong owned financial securities (such as stocks) while the figure was just 10% in France.

| Place     | Percentage of Financial Security Ownerneship |

| Hong Kong | 48%                                          |
| France    | 10%                                          |

### Sustainability Tools in the Taiwanese Context

Musical garbage truck are a success story of the environmental progress in Taiwan [@helendavidsonClassicalTrashHow2022]. Indeed, they are a *user interface innovation* and the main way how people in Taiwan interact with sustainability issues.

The popular narrative about Taiwan recounts the story of the economic and environmental transformation of the country. In the late 1980s during the heights of an economic boom Taiwan became famous as the Taiwanese Miracle (臺灣奇蹟) [@goldStateSocietyTaiwan1986; @tsaiExplainingTaiwanEconomic1999]. By the early 1990s another less flattering nickname appeared: "garbage island", for the piles of trash covering the streets and overflowing landfills [@rapidtransitionsallianceTaiwanTransitionGarbage2019; @ngoHowGettingRid2020]. In the two decades that followed, from 1998 to 2018, Taiwan made progress in municipal waste management, rising to the status of a world-leader in recycling (2nd *effective recycling rate* after Germany); in addition to an effective recycling system, the average waste amount generated per person by 700g (from 1140g to 400g) per day; nonetheless, industrial recycling rates were less stellar, standing at 80% in 2020 and there were unrealized opportunities in using industry 4.0 technologies, such as internet of things (IoT) sensors for better waste tracking [@wuSupportingCircularEconomy2021; @buiMunicipalSolidWaste2023].

Progress in sustainability is possible but achieving results takes time and innovation. [@rapidtransitionsallianceTaiwanTransitionGarbage2019] credits the Taiwanese Homemakers United Foundation (財團法人主婦聯盟環境保護基金會) for initiating the transformation in 1987, suggesting a small group of people can have an outsized impact on the whole country. Their activity didn't stop there and [@CaiTuanFaRenZhuFuLianMengHuanJingBaoHuJiJinHuiBenHuiJianJie2020] recounts a timeline of their achievements on their website until the present day.

-   Progress in other areas of environmental protection has not made similar progress.

### Developing Personas

User research makes extensive use of user *personas* to represent a group of people with similar attributes. Designers use personas to *articulate assumptions,* which, if used well, is useful for *user-centered design*, to create better products. Personas help to reflect on what kind of *biases* might exist in the design. Within the larger cohort of college students several different personas could be defined, for example grouping people by interests, knowledge, habits, levels of anxiety, and other attributes.

Humans have a long list of cognitive biases, which a good design should take into account.

There is extensive research on the attitudes of U.S. college students towards climate change. [@americanpressinstituteKnowingNewsHow2022] reports only 37% percent of U.S. Generation-Z and Millenials follow news related to environmental issues. [@schwartzClimateChangeAnxiety2022] reports some adult US students in a small study (18-35, n = 284) express feelings of insignificance of their actions to achieve any meaningful impact. [@thomaesGreenTeensUnderstanding2023] reports U.S. adolescents don't find sustainability relevant to their daily life. [@rossClimateChangeChallenge2016] says most people in the U.S. don't act on climate change. "Action on climate change has been compromised by uncertainty, aspects of human psychology".

-   Students in the Generation-Z age bracket (abbreviated as Gen-Z or Zoomers) are born between 1997 and 2012 [@brankavuletaGenerationStatistics2023]. Over 98% of Gen-Z owns a smartphone while only 80% of the general world population does [@globalwebindex98GenOwn2017; @bankmycellHowManyPeople2022].

-   High levels of technology adoption worldwide

-   [@creditsuisseYoungConsumersMay2022] suggests young consumers are more eco-friendly and drive the speed of change. Yet the Economist has ran a few anonymous articles calling gen-z green ideals into question [@theeconomistHowSellYoung2023; @HowGenMillennials2023].

-   @deyangeorgiev39SmartphoneStatistics2023

-   @alexreiceMostEcoconsciousGeneration2021

The above studies give foundation for creating a persona of a U.S. College Student who doesn't follow environmental news and thinks climate action doesn't make a difference. This doesn't necessarily mean this group of people with similar ideas would deny climate change is happening. Rather "Climate Denier" could be another persona, grouping people into a cohort who thinks climate change is not real. Further research would be needed to define relevant personas which have meaningful predictive and generalizing power.

| Description           | Name  | Beliefs                       |
|-----------------------|-------|-------------------------------|
| Climate Change Denier | Jake  | Climate change doesn't exist. |
|                       | Alice |                               |

### Social Trust

-   When disaster hits we need high levels of social trust.

### Climate Anxiety

A large worldwide study (n=10000, age 16-25) by [@hickmanClimateAnxietyChildren2021] provides evidence the youth is anxious about climate in Australia, Brazil, Finland, France, India, Nigeria, Philippines, Portugal, the UK, and the USA. Similarly, [@thompsonYoungPeopleClimate2021] finds young people around the world have climate anxiety. [@whitmarshClimateAnxietyWhat2022] shows worry about the climate in the UK is generally widespread (over 40% of the respondents, n=1332), while climate anxiety is highest among young people and is a possible motivator for climate action. Additionally, [@ogunbodeClimateAnxietyWellbeing2022] finds climate anxiety in 32 countries and also supports the idea that climate anxiety leads to climate activism. [@thibodeauThreeCompaniesClosing2022]: "In 2021, the BBC polled 1,000 people in Scotland to understand the barriers to taking climate action. What they found was even though many people were aware of actions needed to take to address climate change, and had intentions to their behaviors didn't change. This is a phenomenon called the intention-action gap."

-   [@osakaWhyClimateDoomers2023] argues *doomerism* is an excuse for climate in-action. Hope is necessary for people to make changes in their habits [@marlonHowHopeDoubt2019].

-   Designing for Health and Sustainability: Health and sustainability are intrinsically connected. [@kjaergardHealthSustainability2014] shows how "understanding health and sustainability as a duality, health both creates conditions and is conditioned by sustainability, understood as economic, social and environmental sustainability, while on the other hand sustainability creates and is conditioned by human health"

-   Design for Human Rights [@unfcccSharmElSheikhImplementation2023]\] text refers to "human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment".

### Community

Humans working together are able to achieve more than single individuals. "Any community on the internet should be able to come together, with capital, and work towards any shared vision. That starts with empowering creators and artists to create and own the culture they're creating. In the long term this moves to internet communities taking on societal endeavors."

-   Building a culture of sustainability? [@lakshmirebeccaManWhoGamifying2018; @armstrongCultivatingCulturesSustainability2021].

The focus on *group consciousness* suggests community-based sustainability action may be effective.

***Zero Waste Lifestyle*** is the opposite of overconsumption. Zero waste suggests people buy in bulk to save. Buying in bulk for more savings and to reduce packaging. Through group purchases and community investing while also reducing consumption. - Zero waste municipality in Treviso

-   In one Australian study, green consumers still waste food similarly to the baseline [@mccarthyFoodWasteGreen2017].

***Minimalism*** is a movement of people living a simple life. This is always going to be a small percentage of people. [@costaHowFinnishCulture2018]: Finnish socialists: minimalism. Tokyo [@tokyosimpleecolifeWhatLearnedMy2021].

### Empowerment

-   I would like to have an AI agent to set my requirements and preferences and give a "fuck you" middle finger to companies that don't meet them. I could also give a thumbs up to companies that meet my expectations. Perhaps the user interface could like Tinder where I can swipe left and right.

## Re-Designing Industries for Provenance and Traceability

It's possible to re-design entire industries and that is exactly the expectation sustainability sets on businesses. Across all industries, there's a call for more transparency. Conversations about sustainability are too general and one needs to look at the specific sustainability metrics at specific industries to be able to design for meaningful interaction. There's plentiful domain-specific research showing how varied industries can develop eco-designed products. I will here focus on 2 industries that are relevant for college students.

### Sustainable Fashion

Young people are the largest consumers of fast fashion [@YoungConsumersComplicated]. [In @europeanenvironmentagencyTextilesEnvironmentRole2022 European Environment Agency (EEA)] estimates based on trade and production data that EU27 citizens consumed an average 15kg of textile products per person per year.

|  | @aespaAespaEseupaMY2020: Karina from Korea. It makes sense your sustainability assistant would talk to you. Studies show gen N is speaking to computers all the time. Interacting with the user is on the rise. For example, Chime makes tipping suggestions on the place of purchase. |
|  | The demographics that stand to win the most from the green transformation of business are the youngest generations, with more years of life ahead of them, and more exposure to future environmental and social risks. It would be advisable for Generation Z and their parents (Millennials) to invest their resources in greener assets, however, it's still difficult to pick and choose between 'good' and 'bad' financial vehicles to invest in. |
|  | This creates an opportunity for a new generation of sustainable investment apps, focusing on the usability and accessibility of ESG for a mainstream audience. Generation Z and Millennials expect a consumer-grade user experience. |
|  | What would that experience look like? I've chosen these demographics with the assumption that if given the right tools, the emotional demand for sustainability could be transformed into action. The exploration of systems of feedback to enable consumers to apply more direct positive and negative pressure to the businesses and consumers signal consequences for undesirable ecological performance is a major motivation of this study. |
