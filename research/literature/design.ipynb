Superapps are possible thanks to **Nudge, Economies of Scale, Network Effects, Behaviour Design.** The most successful businesses today (as measured in terms of the number of users) look at the whole user experience. Popular consumer platforms strive to design solutions that feel personalized at every touchpoint on the user journey (to use the language of service design) but doing so at the scale of hundreds of millions (or even billions) of users - personalization at scale. Superapps are honeypots of data that is used for many types of behavior modeling. For example @suarezEnhancingUserIncome2021 suggests using alternative data from super-apps to estimate user income levels, including 4 types of data: Personal Information, Consumption Patterns, Payment Information, and Financial services. Also @roaSuperappBehavioralPatterns2021 finds super-app alternative data is especially useful for credit-scoring young, low-wealth individuals. The massive amounts of data generated by these companies are used by smart cities to re-design their physical environments. \n",
