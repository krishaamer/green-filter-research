### Food Sustainability
- @FoodPrints2015 reports dairy (46%) and meat and fish (29%) products making up the largest GHG emission potential.
- @springmannGlobalRegionalCosts2021 veganism is the most effective decision to reduce personal CO2 emissions.

- 26% of carbon emissions come from food production (@pooreReducingFoodEnvironmental2018)

@ROOS2023107623 identified 5 perspectives in a small study (_n=106_) of views on the Swedish food system:

1. _"The diagnostic perspective: All hands on deck to fix the climate"_
2. _"The regenerative perspective: Diversity, soil health and organic agriculture to the rescue"_
3. _"The fossil-free perspective: Profitable Swedish companies to rid agriculture and the food chain of fossil fuel"_
4. _"The consumer-driven perspective: A wish-list of healthy, high-quality and climate-friendly foods"_
5. _ "The hands-on perspective: Tangible solutions within the reach of consumers and the food industry"_

### Food Sovereignty
“The global food sovereignty movement, which had been building momentum since its grassroots conception in the late ’90s, quickly gained traction with its focus on the rights of people everywhere to access healthy and sustainable food. One of the pillars of the movement lies in using local food systems to reduce the distance between producers and consumers.”

“We can grow foods just as well in the inner city as we can out in the country because we’re agnostic to arable land,” says Woods. “Because we grow indoors and create our own weather, [climate change] doesn’t affect our produce.”

## Sustainable Fashion and Textile Design
European Environment Agency (EEA) estimates based on trade and production data that EU27 citizens consumed an average 15kg of textile products per person per year (@europeanenvironmentagencyTextilesEnvironmentRole2022). Globally 87% of textile products are burned or landfilled after 1st consumer use (@kohlerCircularEconomyPerspectives2021). In Europe, there's large variance between member states when in comes to textile recycling: while Estonia and France are the only EU countries where separate collection of textiles is required by law, in Estonia 100% of the textiles were burned in an incinerator in 2018 while in France textiles are covered by an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme leading to higher recovery rates (Ibid). 

Nonetheless, EPR schemes do not guarantee circularity and may instead be designed around fees to finance waste management in linear economy models (@christiansenExtendedProducerResponsibility2021). French EPR scheme was upgraded in 2020 to become more circular (@jacquesvernierExtendedProducerResponsibility2021). In any case, strong consumer legislation (such as EPR) has a direct influence on producers' actions. For example, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council notified textile producers in July 2022 reminding factories to produce to French standards in order to be able enter the EU market: (@hktdcresearchFranceExpandsProducer2022).

“Like climate change, the focus on individual actions as a solution is often misplaced, though it remains a focus of media and industry.

### Carbon Labelling
Adding CO2 labels for consumer products have been discussed for decades (@adamcornerWhyWeNeed2012). While academic literature has looked at even minute detail such as color and positioning of the label (@zhouCarbonLabelsHorizontal2019) and there is some indication consumers are willing to pay a small premium for low-CO2 products (@xuLowcarbonEconomyCarbon2022) as well as all else being equal, choose the option with a lower CO2 number (@carlssonSustainableFoodCan2022), the idea of _Carbon Labelling_ is yet to find mainstream adoption. 

Although there's some evidence to suggest labeling low CO2 food enables people to choose a _climatarian diet_ in a large-scale study of UK university students, their impact on the market share of low-carbon meals is negible (@lohmannCarbonFootprintLabels2022). @asioliConsumersValuationCultured2022 found differences between countries, where Spanish and British consumers chose meat products with _‘No antibiotics ever’_ over a _Carbon Trust_ label, whereas French consumers chose CO2 labeled meat products. Labels alone are not enough, as underlined by @edenbrandtConsumerPerceptionsAttitudes2022 in Sweden in a study which found a negative correlation between worrying about climate impact and interest in climate information on products, suggesting a need for wider environmental education programmes. 


### Shopping Footprint
- Shop CO2e emissions for each company who i buy from? “get rid of brands”!! cause they hide and lie

- "The sustainable market for Fast Moving Consumer Goods is $2.5T, that includes an untapped market opportunity worth $1T. Nearly 40% of customers say they would switch from their current preferred brand to one that offers more transparency"

— Current shopping is like having a one-night stand. you barely know the name of your company. You don’t know much about their background. Building consumer feeeling of ownership, create meaningful connections between producers and consumers.

- **AI alert**: “The company you’ve purchased from 3x in the past month is owned by Unilevel, which is under investigation for poor labor practicies and deforestation”.

### Ethics and Cruelty
- Cruelty free brands
- Rank companies based on sustainability
- BCorp
- esg
- etc
- wikipedia /
- Trash found in ocean / nature etc
— Help you to decide: what to buy, how to save, where to invest, 
— Increase your investment point by matching with your contribution /. 
- Point of Sales integration (know the SKU you buy). Integrate to the financial eco footprint (no need to scan the product). What’s the name of the startup that does this? 

### Overconsumption

- “Factory social score”.

- People working at the factories can report conditions

- “But the real breakthrough is how we can surface that real-time ESG data directly to individuals in the shops and online, linked to the products that they are browsing and potentially buying. This means that ESG change will finally be driven by the ultimate judge of business success – the customer.” https://www.esganalytics.io/
