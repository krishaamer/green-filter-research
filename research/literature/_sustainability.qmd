## The Roots of Sustainability in Environmentalism

*"Nachhaltigkeit"* - *sustainability* in German - was likely the first use of the concept of preserving natural resources, conceived by a tax accountant Hannß Carl von Carlowitz in 1713 in his seminal book on forestry - *Sylvicultura oeconomica -*, referring to the goal of achieving prudent forest management practices in his native Saxony in Southeastern Germany, which at the time was under severe *deforestation* pressure from mining, ship-building and agricultural production [@hannsscarlvoncarlowitzSylviculturaOeconomicaOder1713; @gottschlichLegacySylviculturaOeconomica2014]. This particular field of sustainability study is now known as *sustainable yield of natural capital*. The *principal* of the natural resource being managed, such as in fishing and forestry, shouldn't be over-harvested in order to maintain ***ecosystem services*** - a contemporary term from the theory of *natural capital*, referring to benefits humans receive from the stock of world's natural resources [@peterkareivaNaturalCapitalTheory2011].

Defining sustainability perhaps more poetically, the American wildlife ecologist Aldo Leopold proposed the idea of *land ethics* in 1972 as *"\[a\] thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise"* in his landmark work *A Sand County Almanac* [@leopoldSandCountyAlmanac1972]. In a similar vein, the 1987 United Nations' Brundtland Report titled "*Our Common Future"* defined *sustainable development* as *"Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs"* [@worldcommissiononenvironmentanddevelopmentOurCommonFuture1987]. Given these varied ideas for over 300 years, I believe some percentage of people have been concerned with our planet's natural environment and its preservation already for centuries. Yet, it is only in the last 100 and so years that human activities have begun to affect Earth's systems on a previously unseen scale - termed *Anthropocene* -, necessitating a deeper understanding of human-nature interactions, such as in the case of climate change, which is rapidly changing the face of our living environments.

## Measuring and Visualizing Earth's Climate Systems

Studies of Earth's climate go back for over 200 years, starting with Alexander von Humboldt,the founder of climatology, who revolutionized cartography by inventing the first *isothermal maps* in 1816; these maps showed areas with similar temperature, variations in altitude and seasons in different colors [@hontonForgottenFatherClimatology2022] now available as 3D computer models[@IsothermsSimplyEarth2023]. Already in 1896, the Nobel Prize winner Svante Arrhenius first calculated how an increase in CO~2~ levels could have a warming effect on our global climate [@andersonCO2GreenhouseEffect2016; @wulffPetterLegacy2020]. In 1938, Guy Stewart Callendar was the first scientist to demonstrate the warming of Earth's land surface as well as linking the production of fossil fuels to increased CO~2~e and changing climate [@hawkinsIncreasingGlobalTemperatures2013]. Early scientists pioneered climate modeling by calculating the first climate interactions which precede today's complex computer-based *Earth System Models (ESMs)* that integrate the various Earth systems and cycles run on supercomputers [@andersonCO2GreenhouseEffect2016].

```
Environmental activists have been calling attention to global warming for decades, yet the world has been slow to act [@mckibbenEndNature1989]. While the scientific case for human-induced climate change was building, it took 120 years after Arrhenius' calculations, until the Paris Climate Agreement in 2016, that countries came to an agreement on non-binding targets on keeping CO~2~ levels 1.5 °C below pre-industrial levels (defined as 1850–1900)[@unitednationsParisAgreement2016]. Even though awareness of Earth's warming climate was growing ever stronger, the CO~2~ emissions kept rising too. The hockey-stick growth of CO~2~ concentration since the industrial revolution is clear in the data from 1958 onward, following a steady annual increase, called the *Keeling Curve* [@keelingAtmosphericMonthlySitu2017]. Written records of global temperature measurements are available starting from the 1880s, when temperatures began to be documented in ship logs [@BrohanClimate2012]. Finally, although perhaps less accurately, temperature estimations from tree-trunks allow some comparisons with the climate as far back as 2000 years ago [@rubinoLawDomeIce2019].

April 2025 was Earth's 2nd-warmest April on record, with global temperatures reaching 1.32°C above the 20th-century average, driven by persistent El Niño conditions and record-high ocean temperatures [@mastersApril2025Was2025]. This warming aligns with growing concerns about Earth's energy imbalance, which recent satellite data suggest has nearly doubled since 2005; more heat is being trapped in the climate system than is being radiated back to space [@mauritsenEarthsEnergyImbalance2025]. Compounding the issue, 3 key NASA climate satellites responsible for monitoring Earth’s energy budget are nearing the end of their operational life with no replacement missions currently planned, raising alarms about the continuity and reliability of future climate data [@harveyThreeNASAClimate2025]. Likewise, funding for the Scripps Institute, responsible for the Keeling Curve, is under threat, according to its caretaker, Ralph Keeling.

The Keeling Curve apparatus measures absorbion of infrared light, which allows one to detect the amount of CO2 in the air. It also has an advanced calibration system where it makes measurements in air with a known quantity of gases [@worthingtonMakingAmericaDumb2025].

The latest data from 2023 shows our current world population of 8 Billion people emitted 37.2 gigatonnes (i.e. billion metric tons) of CO~2~e per year, the highest emissions recorded in history [@statistaAnnualCO2Emissions2023]. Since 1751, cumulative CO₂e emissions have exceeded 1.5 trillion tonnes globally or when expressed in CO₂e for all green house gases, total historic emissions would reach roughly 1.7 trillion tonnes CO₂e since the start of the Industrial Revolution.[@globalcarbonbudgetCumulativeCOEmissions2023; @marvelOpinionClimateScientist2023]. In order to limit global warming to 1.5 °C as agreed by the world nations in Paris, removal of 5-20 gigatons of CO~2~e per year would be needed according to reduction pathways calculated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [@wadeMoisturedrivenCO2Pump2023; @unfcccNDC2022]. Yet, most countries are missing the mark [@climateanalyticsClimateActionTracker2023; @unitednationsenvironmentprogrammeEmissionsGapReport2023]. The European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) reports 1.5 °C global warming has already been breached in 2024 temperatures [@WorldFirstYearlong2024; @FirstTimeWorld2024]. Given the current pace of climate change action, the G7 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, United States) are heading for 2.7 °C of warming by 2050 [@cdpMissingMarkCDP2022].

[@unitednationsenvironmentprogrammeunepEmissionsGapReport2021] reported as of 2021 updated national climate pledges (NDCs) and other mitigation measures are projected to lead to a global temperature increase of approximately 2.7°C by 2100, significantly surpassing the Paris Agreement's aspirational goal to keep global warming below 1.5°C this century; effective implementation of net-zero emissions pledges could still keep warming around 2.2°C (approaching the Paris Agreement’s goal of below 2°C), if countries cut methane emissions from fossil fuel, waste, and agricultural sectors, bridging the current emissions gap - and carbon markets might significantly cut emissions, if they are governed by clear rules ensuring genuine emission reductions, alongside transparent systems for monitoring and tracking progress - however, numerous national climate strategies postpone substantial action until after 2030. A year later, the 2022 Emissions Gap report showed a somewhat worsening situation, with existing national pledges leading the world for around 2.8 °C of warming by 2100 [@unitednationsenvironmentprogrammeEmissionsGapReport2022]

Earth's physical systems are very sensitive to small changes in temperature, which was not understood until the 1970s[@mckibbenEndNature2006]. A comprehensive review of evidence from paleoclimate records until current time, including ocean, atmosphere, and land surface of points towards substantial climate change if high levels of greenhouse gas emissions continue, termed by the authors as *climate sensitivity* [@sherwoodAssessmentEarthClimate2020]. Global warming may lead to the slowing down and complete stop of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) which helps maintain climate stability [@ditlevsenWarningForthcomingCollapse2023]. Apart from CO~2~, reduction of other atmospheric pollutants, such as non-CO~2~ greenhouse gases (GHGs) and short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) is required for climate stability [@linOpportunitiesTackleShortlived2022].

[@tedTippingPointsClimate2024; @armstrongmckayExceedingGlobalWarming2022] warns that climate is not a linear system, rather there are several non-linear climate tipping points, where change accelerates: at the current warming ice‐sheet collapse, permafrost thaw, Amazon dieback and coral‐reef loss are likely to tip between 1.5 °C and 2 °C, underscoring that the Paris Agreement range is far from a safe limit. [@armstrongmckayExceeding15degCGlobal2022] synthesize paleoclimate records, observations, and model projections to revise and rank both global "core" and regional "impact" climate tipping elements by their warming thresholds, visualized in the chart below.

### Measuring CO~2~e Emissions

Technology improves and measurements have become more accurate yet CO~2~e emissions are not yet completely accounted for. [@crippaFossilCO2GHG2020] reports the latest figures CO~2~e from the EU's Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR). The EU Copernicus satellite system reveals new greenhouse emissions previously undetected [@danielvarjoNyaSatelliterAvslojar2022]. *Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) provides "\[n\]ear-real time updates of key global climate variables*"[@thecopernicusclimatechangeserviceClimatePulse2024]. Using simple python code and freely available images from online datasets, it's increasingly possible for anyone to detect deforestion, as in this example of geospatial analysis from Amazon AWS [@patelAwssamplesAwssmslgeospatialanalysisdeforestation2025; @awsSageMakerStudioLab2022].

One major cross-cutting category the IPCC tracks separately is LULUCF (Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry). Depending on whether forests are being cleared or restored, LULUCF can act as a net greenhouse-gas source or as a powerful carbon sink that removes CO₂ from the atmosphere. LULUCF also links to biodiversity protection. [@chenResponseEcosystemVulnerability2023] looked at the Poyang Lake in China between 2010-2020, finding ecosystem vulnerability rose by 18% with human activities (land-use change, urban expansion, components of LULUCF, also reported in international media, see [@scarrDevoured2021] for images) as the dominant driver, followed by climate factors. [@xieEcologicalCivilizationChina2021] mapped pollution sources in 14 vulnerable areas in China, including the Poyang Lake, and underlined the need for real-time monitoring of ecosytem health.

Emissions production is highly unequal, with *"\[t\]he world's top 1% of emitters produce over 1000 times more CO2 than the bottom 1%"* [@ieaWorldTopEmitters2023]. The share of CO~2~ emissions among people around the world is highly unequal across the world (referred to as *Carbon Inequality*). [@chancelGlobalCarbonInequality2022] reports "one-tenth of the global population is responsible for nearly half of all emissions, half of the population emits less than 12%". Information and communications technology (ICT) sector is an example of carbon inequality, where emerging economies bear 82% of the emissions, developed countries gain 58% of value, of the over 300 million PCs sold per year [@zhouCarboneconomicInequalityGlobal2022; @bajarinPCSalesAre2022].

CO~2~e emissions by region (per year).

|  |  |  |
|----------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| **Regional Average Per Capita Emissions (2020)** | **Highest Per Capita Emissions (2021)** | **Highest Total Emissions (2021)** |
| North America 13.4 CO~2~e tonnes | Palau | China |
| Europe 7.5 CO~2~e tonnes | Qatar | United States |
| Global Average 4.1 CO~2~e tonnes | Kuwait | European Union |
| Africa and the Middle East 1.7 CO~2~e tonnes | Bahrain | India |

: Comparing highest per capita CO~2e~ emissions (mostly from oil producers) vs regional average per capita CO~2~ emissions vs total CO~2~ emissions[@ivanovaQuantifyingPotentialClimate2020; @worldresourcesinstituteCO2EmissionsMetric2020; @europeancommission.jointresearchcentre.CO2EmissionsAll2022; @crippaFossilCO2GHG2020; @liuMonitoringGlobalCarbon2023].

*Scoping* CO~2e~ *emissions* into 4 main categories helps to organize calculating CO~2e~ emissions and corresponding reduction targets by looking at direct and indirect emissions separately. The U.S. National Public Utilities Council (NPUC) decarbonization report provides a useful categorization of *emission scopes* applicable to companies which helps organizing emission reduction schemes [@nationalpublicutilitiescouncilAnnualUtilityDecarbonization2022] based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol defined in the 1990s [@ghgprotocolUsGHGProtocol]. For example, for consumers in Australian states and territories in 2018, 83% of the GHG emissions are Scope 3, meaning indirect emissions in the value chain [@goodwinTargetingDegreesGlobal2023]. A newer concept is Scope 4 emissions also known as avoided emissions, proposed by the World Resources Institute (WRI) in 2013 [@planaWhatAreScope].

|                |                                |
|----------------|--------------------------------|
| Emission Scope | Emission Source                |
| Scope 1        | Direct emissions               |
| Scope 2        | Indirect electricity emissions |
| Scope 3        | Value chain emissions          |
| Scope 4        | Avoided emissions              |

: Definition of Emission Scopes From [@nationalpublicutilitiescouncilAnnualUtilityDecarbonization2022]. One's scope 3 emissions are someone else's scope 1 emissions.

Countries have agreed up CO~2e~ Reduction Targets known as Country-Level Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). While most countries have not reached their Nationally Determined Contributions, the Climate Action Tracker data portal allows to compare countries by their NDC peformance [@climateanalyticsClimateActionTracker2023]. [@fransenStateNationallyDetermined2022] notes that the majority of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are dependent on financial assistance from the international community.

Fossil fuels are what powers humanity as well as the largest source of CO~2~ emissions. [@ieaGlobalEnergyReview2022] reports "Global CO~2~ emissions from energy combustion and industrial processes rebounded in 2021 to reach their highest ever annual level. A 6% increase from 2020 pushed emissions to 36.3 gigatonnes". As on June 2023, fossil fuel based energy makes up 82% of energy and is still growing [@instituteEnergySystemStruggles2023]. The 425 largest fossil fuel projects represent a total of over 1 gigatons in CO~2~ emissions, 40% of which were new projects @kuhneCarbonBombsMapping2022. @tilstedEndingFossilbasedGrowth2023 expects the fossil fuel industry to continue grow even faster. In July 2023, the U.K. granted hundreds of new oil and gas of project licenses in the North Sea [@RishiSunakGreenlight2023].

[@emberElectricityDataExplorer2025] Ember’s Electricity Data Explorer shows Taiwanese energy usage based on data from Taiwanese government, visualizing the growth in gas, wind, and solar, and decline of coal and nuclear power; however, while declining, coal remains the leading power source for Taiwan. Climate pledges made by international companies present in Taiwan mean they need large amounts of green energy to meet their sustainability goals. For instance, Google worked with the government of Taiwan to change the laws to allow direct power procurement by foreign companies; the current plan being to install 1 gigawatt of solar power fully pre-purchased by the newly formed company created by BlackRock and Google for boosting AI development as reported by [@jessopGoogleBuysStake2024; @chiangGoogleInvestsBlackRockbacked2024; @YongXinNengYuannewgreenpowerBlackRockAcquire1002022]. More recently, Google also purchased 10MW of geothermal energy for its Taiwanese AI chip projects, doubling current Taiwanese geothermal capacity [@wuGoogleAnnouncesMilestone2025; @potterGoogleJustFlipped2025; @hagstrom-ilievskaMajorStepGeothermal2025]. Geothermal energy provides 24/7 clean energy from the Earth's core, however is limited due to lack of acccess; Taiwan happens to be in geologically active spot on the ring of fire, where drilling for geothermal energy is more feasible [@lGoogleIgnitesTaiwans2025; @changOurFirstGeothermal2025].

### Carbon Accounting, Emissions Trading Schemes

Trading CO~2e~ emissions can be divided into 2 categories, namely *Compliance Carbon Markets* (CCM) and *Voluntary Carbon Markets* (VCM). The legislative baseline for Compliance Carbon Markets is so low, people want to retire more CO~2e~, which they can do through *Voluntary Carbon Markets.*

As of 2024 there's no single global CO~2~ trading market but rather several local markets as described in the table below. Most of the world is not part of a CO~2~ market.

|  |  |  |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|

| EU | 2005 | EU: @araujoEuropeanUnionMembership2020 |
| South Korea | 2015 |  |
| China | 2021 | China's national emissions trading scheme (ETS) started in 2021 priced at 48 yuan per tonne of CO~2~, averaged at 58 yuan in 2022 [@liuIndepthWillChina2021; @ivyyinCommodities2023China2023]. |

| Canada | 2013 |  |

: CO~2~ credit trading markets around the world from [@InternationalCarbonMarket].

The price of CO~2e~ differs across markets, as assigning a monetary value to reducing CO~2e~ emissions depends on several variables. [@sternCarbonNeutralEconomy2022] argues carbon-neutral economy needs higher CO~2e~ prices and believes [@rennertComprehensiveEvidenceImplies2022] CO~2e~ price per ton should be 3,6x higher that it is currently. Contrary, [@ritzGlobalCarbonPrice2022] argues optimal CO~2~ prices could be highly asymmetric, low in some countries and high (above the social cost of CO~2e~) in countries where production is very polluting. The total size of carbon markets reached 949 billion USD in 2023, including Chinese, European, and North American CO~2~ trading [@lsegGlobalCarbonMarkets2024].

The prices between compliance and voluntary markets differ substantially.

Voluntary Carbon Markets are a decentralized system where private entities voluntarily buy and sell carbon credits [@icvcmVoluntaryCarbonMarket2025]. Carbon credits are useful for private companies who wish to claim *carbon neutrality, climate positivity*, or other related claim, which might be viewed in good light by their clients or allow the companies to adhere to certain legislative requirements. In the simplest terms, a carbon credit represents 1T of CO2 that has been prevented from entering the atmosphere - or has been removed from circulation (aka Carbon Credit Retirement) [@annawatsonCarbonCreditRetirements2023; @annawatsonCarbonDioxideRemoval2022]. However it's important to look at the details of these deal as Voluntary Carbon Markets (VCM) lack standardization and transparency [@elakhodaiWhyVCMNeeds2023]. For example, Flickr only invested around 3000 USD in carbon credits and got a carbon-neutral rating, which hardly seems enough for an organization of its size [@climateneutralFlickrClimateLabel2024].

Markets are centered around carbon credits, nature-backed financial derivatives dependent on science-based methodologies for measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV), which are managed and regularly updated by certification organizations such as Gold Standard, Verra, and others. Some standards released in the past few years include the Verra Agricultural Land Management methodology for Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) [@verraVerraReleasesRevised2023]. Gold Standard recently release a methodology for Mangrove-based carbon credits [@goldstandardSustainableMangroveManagement2024]. Regen Network released a methodology for regenerative grazing systems, proposing remote-sensing analysis with field-sampled soil carbon data, quantifing GHG sequestration and ecological co-benefits (biodiversity, water-infiltration, etc.) for robust MRV and carbon-credit issuance [@MethodologyGHGCoBenefits2022]. KlimaDAO, unhappy with the current standards, published “An open call for alternative carbon standards” inviting carbon-credit issuers and communities to propose next-generation registry frameworks and leverage blockchain for transparency, liquidity and interoperability in the voluntary carbon market [@klimadaoOpenCallAlternative2023].

| Criteria | Description |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Baseline | Ecosystem carbon sequestration rate without the intervention (project) |
| Additionality | New carbon capture or prevention of emissions |
| Permanence | Carbon storage time (should be long-term) |
| Leakage | Risk of shift to causing emissions (for example because of deforestation) |

: Criteria for carbon credit projects from [@verraVerraReleasesRevised2023].

For the individual person, there's no direct access to CO~2~ markets. However, brokers do buy large amounts of carbon credits to resell in smaller quantities to retail investors. Facilitating citizens' access to CO~2~ emissions trading may be an efficient method to organize large-scale CO~2~ retiring [@rousseEnvironmentalEconomicBenefits2008]. [@sipthorpeBlockchainSolutionsCarbon2022] compares traditional and blockchain-based solutions to carbon trading, arguqing that blockchain solutions for CO2 markets are nearing maturity, and offer many improvements, such as enhancing transparency, trust, and efficiency.

CO~2e~ credits have given rise to the Carbon Accounting industry, to help companies meet legal emissions reduction targets in Compliance Carbon Markets, with many companies like Watershed, Greenly, and Sustaxo providing services. [@quatriniChallengesOpportunitiesScale2021] admits sustainability assessments are often complex and may give flawed results. Nonetheless, CO~2~ emission reduction has the added positive effect of boosting corporate morale [@caoImpactLoweringCarbon2023].

There are many companies which facilitate buy carbon credits as well as a few organizations focused on carbon credit verification. In Estonia, startups Arbonic and Single.Earth are trialing this approach in several forests. The most established certifiers or carbon credits include the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS), the Gold Standard, Climate Action Reserve (CAR)‍, and the American Carbon Registry (ACR).

*"Carbon pricing is not there to punish people,"* says Lion Hirth [@lionhirthLionHirthTwitter]. *"It's there to remind us, when we take travel, heating, consumption decisions that the true cost of fossil fuels comprises not only mining and processing, but also the damage done by the CO~2~ they release."* Long term cost of insufficient climate action is more than short-term gains from delaying efforts to reduce carbon emissions. In addition to the damages from global warming, the fossil energy production that's a large part of global CO2 emissions has caused several high-profile pollution events. Large ones that got international news coverage include Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon.

Carbon credit prices should reflect the quality of the carbon reduction. Nature-based carbon removal solutions (for example, forest-backed carbon credits) rank among the top solutions for mitigating climate change but require price signals that reflect their true value; Pachama’s (an AI-based carbon removal company) calculation from bottom up cost modelling across more than 150 reforestation projects indicate that high quality forest carbon removal credits must trade at a minimum of USD 50-82 per tonne of CO₂e to be competitive with alternative land uses (IPCC AR6 guidance sets the price spread wider, from USD 50-200); reduced land-use change (basically this means not cutting down forests, IPCC groups together as LULUCF, Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry) ranks 2nd to solar energy in terms of carbon reduction potential [@pachamaHowMuchShould2023; @luikWhereDoesCarbon2025].

### Markets Financialize the Natural World: Pricing, Tracing, and Trading Ecosystem Services and Nature-backed Assets

Similarly to carbon markets, markets for nature-backed assets and ecosystem services are centered around different types of credits.

| **Asset Type** | **Description** |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Carbon Credits and Offsets | Represent avoided or removed CO₂e emissions through reforestation, soil health improvements, regenerative farming practices that sequester carbon, etc |
| Biodiversity Credits | Represent conservation and restoration of species or ecosystems quantified by some standard or criteria such as provided by Verra and Gold Standard |

### Overconsumption \> Earth's Boundaries

Excessive consumer lifestyle - *overconsumption* - is one of the main drivers of climate change and environmental destruction, with *"2/3 of global GHG emissions are directly and indirectly linked to household consumption, with a global average of about 6 tonnes CO~2~ equivalent per capita"* , according to [@reneechoHowBuyingStuff2020; @ivanovaQuantifyingPotentialClimate2020]. An older study put the number as high as 60% percent [@ivanovaEnvironmentalImpactAssessment2016] while [@ellenmacarthurfoundationmaterialeconomicsCompletingPictureHow2019]'s models 45% show of CO~2~ equivalent emissions come from our shopping; produced by companies to make the products we consume. [@keebleBrundtlandReportOur1988] reported in April 1987 that *'residents in high-income countries lead lifestyles incompatible with planetary boundaries'*.
[@ivanovaQuantifyingPotentialClimate2020] reports the average footprint in North America and Europe is 13.4 t CO₂e, in Africa and the Middle East 1.7t CO₂e; consumption options with a high mitigation potential measured in tonnes of CO~2~ equivalent per capita per year include *"living car-free"* and avoiding flying, which could each save upwards of 1.7t CO₂e per person annually.

While the numbers on overconsumption are clear, the debate on overconsumption is so polarized, it's difficult to have a meaningful discussion of the topic [@ianoleOverconsumptionSocietyLookingglass2013]. Environmental risks from human activities are known as Anthropogenic Threat Complexes (ATCs) [@bowlerMappingHumanPressures2020]. With the trend of urbanization, it's not surprising (people living in) cities are responsible for 80% of the emissions [@rosalescarreonUrbanEnergySystems2018]. [@mobergMobilityFoodHousing2019] reports daily human activities emission contribution on average in four European countries (France, Germany, Norway and Sweden).

|                |          |
|----------------|----------|
| Emission Share | Category |
| 21%            | Housing  |
| 30%            | Food     |
| 34%            | Mobility |
| 15%            | Other    |

: Daily human activities emission contribution on average in France, Germany, Norway and Sweden from [@mobergMobilityFoodHousing2019].

Taking a broader view, [@hannahritchieSectorSectorWhere2020; @usepaGlobalGreenhouseGas2016] dissect GHG emissions inventory by sector and put the blame squarely on the type of energy used.

| Sector | Share | Description |
|---------------|--------------:|-------------------------------------------|
| Energy Use (inc. electricity, heat and transport) | 73.2 % | Total CO2 emissions from all fuel combustion and related fugitive losses. Energy use in industry (24.2%) in processing metals (iron and steel), chemicals and petrochemicals, food and tobacco, non ferrous metals, paper, machinery, other industry; transport (16.2%) road, aviation, shipping, rail; buildings (17.5%) including residential and commercial; fugitive emissions (5.8%) such as methane leaks from oil and gas exploitation and coal mining; plus other, unallocated fuel combustion related emissions (7.8%) |
| Direct Industrial Processes | 5.2 % | Direct CO2 emissions from chemical reactions in cement and in chemicals and petrochemicals. |
| Waste | 3.2 % | Wastewater methane and NO2 emissions; landfill methane. |
| Agriculture + LULUCF (Land Use, Land-Use Change & Forestry) | 18.4 % | Emissions from grassland, cropland, deforestation, crop burning, rice cultivation, agricultural soils, livestock and manure. |

: Data from [@hannahritchieSectorSectorWhere2020; @usepaGlobalGreenhouseGas2016].

Earth's growing population reached 8 Billion people In November 2022 and population projections by predict 8.5B people by 2030 and 9.7B by 2050 [@theeconomictimesClimateChangeEarth2022; @unWorldPopulationProspects2022]. Indeed, making *anything* consumes natural resources, which are limited on planet Earth. [@hassounFoodProcessingCurrent2023] forecasts increase of global food demand by 62% driven by the impact of climate change. Yet, while population growth puts higher pressure on Earth's resources, some researchers propose the effect is higher from wasteful lifestyles than the raw number of people [@cardinaleBiodiversityLossIts2012]. Meanwhile others, such as [@cafaroOverpopulationMajorCause2022], believe *\[o\]verpopulation is a major cause of biodiversity loss and smaller human populations are necessary to preserve what is left."*

### Plastic Pollution

Overconsumption is also one of the root causes of plastic pollution. [@FORD2022150392] and [@laversFarDistractionPlastic2022] find strong links between climate change and marine plastic pollution *"along with other stressors that threaten the resilience of species and habitats sensitive to both climate change and plastic pollution"*.

Plastic pollution is pervasive around the Earth and is fundamentally linked to climate change, while microplastics are increasingly a real concern [@TIERNAN2022169; @laversFarDistractionPlastic2022]. Several international studies report recent findings of microplastics everywhere in human bodies: the brain, lungs, digestive tissues, bone marrow, penis, testis, seminal fluid (semen), and placenta - causing serious health and reproductive concerns [@mainMicroplasticsAreInfiltrating2024; @guoDiscoveryAnalysisMicroplastics2024; @huMicroplasticPresenceDog2024; @codringtonDetectionMicroplasticsHuman2024; @liPrevalenceImplicationsMicroplastic2024; @montanoRamanMicrospectroscopyEvidence2023; @garciaQuantitationIdentificationMicroplastics2024; @zhuTissueAccumulationMicroplastics2024]

```{python}
microplastics_body_chart()
```

In addition to the enormity of over-reaching CO~2~ emissions, humanity is facing other massive environmental problems. The Stockholm Resilience Centre report in 2022 we have already breached 4 out of our 9 *"planetary boundaries":* in addition to climate change, biodiversity loss (Extinctions per Million Species per Year aka E/MSY), land-system change (deforestation, land degradation, etc), and biogeochemical flows (cycles of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, etc); on a positive side, the challenges of fresh water use, ocean acidification and stratospheric ozone depletion are still within planetary limits [@perssonOutsideSafeOperating2022].

An update to the planetary boundaries framework a year later found the actual number to be 6 of 9 boundaries (climate, biosphere integrity, land use, biogeochemical flows, freshwater use, novel entities) already transgressed, with ocean acidification nearing its limit and only stratospheric ozone recovering; atmospheric aerosol loading and the biodiversity intactness index (BII), which belongs under biodiversity loss and measures how depleted are the species that are still around (but not yet extinct), were quantified recently [@richardsonEarthSixNine2023; @newboldHasLandUse2016].

In the biospehere, mass extinctions are underway. An analysis of population trends for 27600 terrestrial vertebrate species (including a detailed sample of 177 mammals), found 32% (8851 species) are undergoing severe range contractions; the authors name this "biological annihilation" to signal Earth’s ongoing 6 mass extinction and call for immediate conservation action [@ceballosBiologicalAnnihilationOngoing2017]. As of last year, the Red List curated by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), includes 45,300 species (28% of all assessed, since IUCN was founded in 1948), under threat of extinction [@iucnIUCNRedList2024].

In 2018 Swedish Sportswear brand Houdini launched the first corporate planetary boundaries assessment in partnership with Albaeco and Stockholm Resilience Centre to establish a baseline for its "impact positive" ambition [@houdiniPlanetaryBoundariesAssessment2018]. While it's a pilot study, it demonstrates how companies can integrate system-level science into sustainability reporting [@haeggmanPlanetaryBoundariesAnalysis2018]. At the 2024 update for the report, Houdini invited, Johan Rockström, a renown conservation and climate scientist, envisions a global dashboard of the development of the economy and the state of the planetary boundaries, with high resolution maps, to help visualize Earth's situation in real-time [@houdinisportswear2024PlanetaryBoundaries2024].

### Evolving Measurements from Planetary Health to Earth System Law, and Social Cost of Carbon

Scientists in cross-disciplinary teams have been working on integrating Earth systems and human society into cohesive frameworks. [@wardaniBoundariesSpacesKnowledge2023] stresses that every facet of Earth’s life-support system—living biota and the "abiotic" foundations of climate, water, soils, and geology—co-produces the conditions for civilisation: *"long-term human well-being is dependent on the well-being of the planet, including both biotic and abiotic systems. It recognizes interlinkages across environmental sustainability, public health, and socioeconomic development."*

There are 3 approaches that address the complex interdependence of humans with our physical environment, that have the potential to be complementary - *Planetary Health*, *Social Cost of Carbon*, and *Earth System Law*.

*Planetary Health* is a framework rooted in public health sciences and medicine; what if public health levelled-up to planetary scale, concerned with the health of ecological life-support systems: clean air, food, and a safe climate, so they can support human flourishing; in practice the framework focuses on evidence, education, governance, and business [@planetaryhealthalliancePlanetaryHealth2024; @planetaryhealthalliancePlanetaryHealthRoadmap2024].

*Social Cost of Carbon* attempts to measures the compound impact of CO~2e~ emissions on society. Sustainability is filled with complexities. CO~2e~ emissions are complicated by biodiversity loss, child labor, slavery, poverty, chemical pollution, etc. - many issues become intertwined [@tedxSustainableBusinessFrank2020]. One attempt to measure these complexities, is the *Social Cost of Carbon* (SCC) which is defined as *"additional damage caused by an extra unit of emissions"* [@kornekSocialCostCarbon2021; @zhenSimpleEstimateSocial2018]. For example the cost of damages caused by "one extra ton of carbon dioxide emissions" [@stanforduniversityProfessorsExplainSocial2021]. SCC variations exist between countries [@tolSocialCostCarbon2019] and regions [@wangMeasurementChinaProvincial2022].

*Earth System Law* is a framework rooted in the legal sciences for addressing interconnected environmental challenges in a hyper-connected Earth, where climate feedbacks and environmental thresholds don't respect country borders; in practice, this line of thinking helps to develop carbon-budget clauses inside trade deals and biodiversity "safety brakes" that trigger when monitoring data shows an Earth boundary overshoot, potentially acting as the legal scaffolding that lets Planetary Health prescriptions and Social Cost of Carbon price signals be effective [@dutoitReimaginingInternationalEnvironmental2022]. 

More recently, because of the complex interdependence, [@zhangBordersAssessingGlobal2025] proposes a new sustainability index that systematically considers pertinent indicators of interdependencies and interactions across different dimensions of sustainability. Moreover, [@lentonQuantifyingHumanCost2023] proposed a new innovative way to quantify the "cost" of global warming in human terms by counting the number of people forced outside the "human climate niche" (temperatures historically occupied by most of humanity); climate change has already exposed ≈9% of today’s population (\>600 million) unprecedented heat stress, risking increased mortality, morbidity and displacement; if current trends continue by 2100, \~2.7 °C , 21–39 % or 2–4 billion people will be exposed by 2080–2100.

## Ecosystem Services: Quantifying Human Benefits from Nature

*Ecosystem services measure the benefits humans receive from the biosphere.* Put simply, *ecosystem services* enable human life on Earth. While it can be assumed much of the flora and fauna are crucial for Earth's systems, science is still in the process of understanding and quantifying its contributions. The history of the valuation of nature's services goes back to the 18th century when David Ricardo and Jean Baptiste Say discussed nature's *work*, however both considered it should be free [@historyEcosystemServices2010]. In 1997 [@dailyNatureServicesSocietal1997] proposed the idea of *ecosystem services* and [@costanzaValueWorldEcosystem1997] attempted to assess the amount of ecosystem services provided. [@leprovostSupplyMultipleEcosystem2022]'s study shows *biodiversity* as one key factor to maintain delivery of ecosystem services. [@noriegaResearchTrendsEcosystem2018] attempts to quantify the ecosystem services (ES) provided by insects.

The most complex computer models which attempt to capture ever more interactions happening in the physical realm are called *digital twins.* The EU is developing a digital twin of Earth to help sustainability prediction and planning, integrating Earth's various systems such as climate, hydrology, ecology, etc, into a single model [@hoffmannDestinationEarthDigital2023; @DestinationEarthShaping2023]. For instance, AI is being used to map icebergs and measure the change in size [@europeanspaceagencyAIMapsIcebergs2023]. We can use all the data being recorded to provide a digital twin of the planet, nature, ecosystems and human actions to help us change our behavior and optimize for planetary wellbeing.

### The Biosphere: Earth's Life Support System

Earth's biosphere is made up of 846 terrestrial ecoregions, which are distributed across 14 major biomes and 8 biogeographical realms [@dinersteinEcoregionBasedApproachProtecting2017].

### Using Ecological Indicators to Track Environmental Health

In Europe, as of 2025, none of the evaluated biodiversity targets are on track; agricultural targets, such as reducing soil nutrient losses, and reducing fertiliser use, are particularly lagging [@europeancommissionProtectingEcosystemsAlmost2025].

Sustainability can be measured using a variety of *ecological indicators*. Ecological indicators for Earth *- I would like to coin the word "ecomarkers" -* are like *biomarkers* in human health. Technological advances help scientist better understand nature. Cutting edge research uses AI-based voice recognition for listening to nature, assessing biodiversity based on species' sounds in the forest. Millions of detections of different species with machine learning passive acoustic AI models, can also assess species' response to climate change [@aiforgoodListeningNatureHarnessing2023; @guerreroAcousticAnimalIdentification2023].

*Environmental DNA (eDNA)* helps scientists measure species abundance without direct observation through detection of DNA on genetic materials such as skin cells [@peterandreysmitharchivepageHowEnvironmentalDNA2024]. Cellular DNA can be isolated from various sediment types [@ogramExtractionPurificationMicrobial1987]. Beyond scientific applications, eDNa is being used to generate biodiversity credits by environmental asset rating companies such as BeZero, a ratings agency for the Voluntary Carbon Market [@ojoatreTriallingEDNABiodiversity2023].

### Measuring Biodiversity Loss and Environmental Degradation

Pressure on ecosystems is rapidly increasing, with biodiversity destruction ever prevalent, making protecting biodiversity as urgent as protecting the climate. [@livingPlanetReport2022] reported, the number of species killed, mass destruction of nature. "69% decline in the relative abundance of monitored wildlife populations around the world between 1970 and 2018. Latin America shows the greatest regional decline in average population abundance (94%), while freshwater species populations have seen the greatest overall global decline (83%)."

Similarly to climate protection, the UN has taken a leadership role in biodiversity protection, by organizing an annual Convention on Biodiversity. The history of the United Nations Convention on Biodiversity goes back to 1988, when the working group was founded [@unitHistoryConvention2023]. The Convention on Biodiversity 2022 (COP15) adopted the first global biodiversity framework to accompany climate goals [@unepCOP15EndsLandmark2022].

Biodiversity loss is linked to overconsumption, weak legislation and lack of oversight. [@crennaBiodiversityImpactsDue2019] recounts European Union consumers' negative impact on biodiversity in countries where it imports food. [@wwfForestsReducingEU2022] case study highlights how 4 biodiverse regions Cerrado in Brazil, Chaco in Argentina, Sumatra in Indonesia, and the Cuvette Centrale in Democratic Republic of Congo are experiencing rapid destruction due to consumer demand in the European Union. While the European Union (EU) has recently become a leader in sustainability legislation, biodiversity protection measures among private companies is very low @marco-fondevilaTrendsPrivateSector2023.

Starting with the simple question: why protect biodiversity. [@mayWhyShouldWe2011] argues biodiversity loss is a concern for 3 points of views:

|  |  |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Point of View | Description |
| Narrowly Utilitarian | Biodiversity is a resource of genetic novelties for the biotech industry. |
| Broadly Utilitarian | Humans depend upon biodiverse ecosystems. |
| Ethical | Humans have a responsibility to future generations to pass down a rich natural world. |

: Concepts from [@mayWhyShouldWe2011].

There is some progress in biodiversity conservation as "\[\*b\]iodiversity awareness is now at 72% or higher in all countries sampled, compared to only 29% or higher across countries sampled in 2009"\* [@uebtBiodiversityBarometer2022]

### Oceans and Marine Ecosystem Sustainability

Marine heatwaves are intensifying under climate change, threatening species diversity and the ocean’s capacity to supply critical services from fisheries to carbon sequestration [@smaleMarineHeatwavesThreaten2019]. Accelerating ocean warming, evidenced by record-breaking sea-surface temperatures, has triggered widespread coral bleaching, cleary visible at the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland, East Coast of Australia, loss of marine habitat complexity, and cascading threats to coastal economies and food security; the authors call for integrated climate–ocean policy action, stressing that without urgent emissions cuts and ecosystem-based adaptation, the ocean’s capacity to regulate climate and sustain biodiversity will collapse [@gellesOceanDireMessage2023; @pfeifferCoralGiantsSound2024]. Cumulative pressures: climate extremes, pollution, and overexploitation — have driven evolutionary shifts in marine life and unpredictably altered ecosystem-service delivery [@espinosaImpactsEvolutionChanges2023].

Some earlier studies, such as [@howardPotentialIntegrateBlue2017] demonstrate how integrating blue carbon habitats into Marine Protected Area (MPA) design can both mitigate carbon emissions and enhance ecosystem resilience. Meta-analyses across 121 sites in 87 MPAs globally show that most well-designed and managed MPAs achieve significant ecological gains: on average, fish biomass inside no-take zones can double to triple compared with outside areas, and species richness likewise increases by 20–30 % within 5–10 years of enforcement [@ruddPathwaysMarineProtected2015]. However, Marine Protected Areas cover only 8% of the world's oceans and only 2.8% is effectively protected [@iginiJust28Worlds2024]. The UN’s 30x30 target (set under the Convention on Biological Diversity) aims to protect 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030, however is not on track to achieve this goal [@mouterdeBiodiversityWorldNot2024].

### Forests: Carbon Sinks and Biodiversity Reservoirs

Forests are a crucial part of Earth's carbon cycle and the main natural CO~2~ capture system; due to deforestation, Europe rapidly losing its forest carbon sink [@fredericsimonEuropeRapidlyLosing2022]. Beyond their role in locking away carbon, recent field work shows forest actively scrub methane from the air as tree bark absorbs methane [@gauciGlobalAtmosphericMethane2024]. Around 27% of Earth's land area is still covered by forests yet *deforestation* is widespread all around the world; highest rates of deforestation happened in the tropical rainforests of South America and Africa, mainly caused by agricultural cropland expansion (50% of all deforestation) and grazing land for farm animals to produce meat (38,5%), totaling close to 90% of global deforestation [@FRA2020Remote2022]. The global forest cover change is visible on Google's Earth Engine [@hansenHighResolutionGlobalMaps2013].

Around the world, there are many initiatives to increase forest cover, for example the *1 billion tree project* [@greenfieldVeNeverSaid2021; @ErratumReportGlobal2020; @bastinGlobalTreeRestoration2019]. However, it's important to not planting trees (*afforestation)* is not the full solution, as *afforestation* is different from *reforestation*, which takes into account biodiversity. Also, while using remote-sensing and machine-learning to assess reforestation potential [see @klostermanMappingGlobalPotential2022], it doesn't take into account local political realities, and socioeconomic issues such as education, poverty and access to green jobs. Taking these aspect into account may be beneficial, for example [@bousfieldCarbonPaymentsCan2022] reports there's evidence paying landowners for the ecosystem services their forests provide may reduce deforestation.

### Pollution: Air, Water, and Soil Degradation

In, Taiwan this is the ranking of pollution reports by citizens [@ministryofdigitalaffairsZhengFuZiLiaoKaiFangPingTai2024]:

```{python}

```

```{python}

```

Health and sustainability are inextricably linked. "Human health is central to all sustainability efforts.", *"All of these (food, housing, power, and health care), and the stress that the lack of them generate, play a huge role in our health"* [@sarahludwigrauschSustainabilityYourHealth2021].

[@abuelkheir-matariaClimateChangeWomens2025] finds warming climate in the MENA region (Middle East and North Africa) increases cancer risk in women, mediated through air pollution and other environmental stressors.

**Air Pollution**

Clean air is a proposed as a *human right* [@baronessjonesofmoulsecoombCleanAirHuman2023] yet air pollution is widespread around the planet, with 99% of Earth's human population being affected by bad air quality that does not meet WHO air quality guidelines, leading to health problems linked to 6.7 million *premature deaths* every year [@worldhealthorganizationAmbientOutdoorAir2022].

Air pollution is linked to cancer incidence. In Taiwan, South Korea, and England, groundbreaking research by [@lim1MOAirPollutioninduced2022] analyzed over 400000 individuals establishes exposure to 2.5μm PM (PM2.5) air pollution as a *cause for lung cancer.* In [@hannahdevlinCancerBreakthroughWakeup2022], professor Tony Mok, of the Chinese University of Hong Kong explains it plainly, which I want to quote here in verbatim:

> *"We have known about the link between pollution and lung cancer for a long time, and we now have a possible explanation for it. As consumption of fossil fuels goes hand in hand with pollution and carbon emissions, we have a strong mandate for tackling these issues -- for both environmental and health reasons."*

The main way to combat air pollution is through policy interventions. [@marialuisfernandesRealityCheckIndustrial2023] the EU has legislation in progress to curb industrial emissions. If legislation is in place, causing bad air quality can become bad for business. In China, [@guHiddenCostsNongreen2023] links air pollution to credit interest rates for business loans; companies with low environmental awareness and a history of environmental penalties pay 12 percent higher interest rates. In France, [@bouscasseDesigningLocalAir2022] finds strong health and economic benefits across the board from air pollution reduction.

**Water and Soil Pollution**

Lack of access to sufficient clean water and water pollution are issues in several places around the world. Globally, 4.4 billion people only have access to water that's not safe for drinking [@solimanUnacceptableStaggeringBillion2024].

Even in wealthy countries like the the US, with increasing situations of water scarcity and drought due to climate change, issues of water ownership become increasingly dire. [@naishadhamDroughtstrickenArizonaFresh2023; @kochOpinionArizonaRace2022] describes a fight in the US over water usage rights in Arizona, where Fondomonte, a subsidiary of a Saudi Arabian company that grows a water-hungry crop alfalfa, exacerbating the local water crisis by using large amounts of public water, leading to public outcry and being sued for "public nuisance" for its excessive groundwater pumping, and finally cessation of its lease and operations on state land; but still continuing operations on private land [@naishadhamArizonaCancelLeases2023; @SaudiFirmThat2023].

Water quality is highly dependent on competent governance. For example, in the U.S., the national government recently rolled back rules for water safety, which had been implemented last year, to protect the consumer from per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) [@tragerPFASRegulationsUS2025].

Once pollution is in the environment, cleaning it up is very expensive. For instance, in France, where storm water washed pollution into the waterways feeding into the Seine river, making it unsuitable for swimming, the city of Paris invested 1.4 Billion Euros to create a massive underground reservoir and a water cleaning system by the opening of the Paris Olympics in 2024 - and still the water quality would be variable based on rain incidence [@waltBillionDollarEffortClean2023].

Water and soil pollution are highly connected, as water flows through soil. In Saudi Arabia, [@picoWildRuderalPlants2023] used wild and ruderal plants as bioindicators to detect pollution of air, water and soil,specifically anthropogenic pollution, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and other industrial chemicals, concluding both Abha and Riyadh showed notable levels of pollutants while Riyadh (a city with more industry) showed higher levels of pollution.

A practical example of the interconnection between water pollution, agriculture, architecture, and extreme weather, are bioswales, which help catch storm debris and reduce water pollution.

### Climate and Disaster Preparedness: Building Resilience to Extreme Weather

The Word Economic Forums Global Risks Report 2024 paints a bleak picture of the future with expectations of increased turbulence across the board based on a survey of over 1400 topic experts [@worldeconomicforumGlobalRisksReport]. Global warming specifically increases the risk of disasters and extreme weather events; the US Global Change Research Program presented a comprehensive report to the US Congress, which links disaster-risk directly to global warming; for examples increased wildfires damage property, endanger life and reduces *air quality,* which in effect increases health challenges [@FifthNationalClimate2023]. Warming global climate has concrete effects on daily life. Warmer climate helps viruses and fungi spread [@pressFungalDiseaseRapidly2023]. [@williamsIntensificationWinterTransatlantic2013] higher CO2 concentrations in the air can cause more turbulence for flights. As extreme temperatures are increasingly commonplace, with observed changes in heatwaves, there's increased risk of wildfires [@volkovaEffectsPrescribedFire2021; @perkins-kirkpatrickExtremeHeatClimate2023], while flood risk mapping might lower property prices in at risk areas [@sherrenFloodRiskMapping2024]. Summers of 2022 and 2023 were the hottest on record so far, with extreme heat waves recorded in places around the world [@venturelliHighTemperatureCOVID192023; @serrano-notivoliUnprecedentedWarmthLook2023; @douglasThisSummerTrack2023; @EarthJustHad2023; @NOAAJune2023; @falconer123MillionHeat2023].

The part of Earth where the *human climate niche* is becoming smaller [@mckibbenWhereShouldLive2023]. As temperatures rise, certain cities may become uninhabitable for humans [@cbcradioExtremeHeatCould2021]. The summer of 2023 saw extensive wildfires in Spain, Canada, and elsewhere; rapidly moving fires destroyed the whole city of Lāhainā in Hawaii \[ADD CITATION\]. In California, [@jerrettSmokeCaliforniaGreenhouse2022] says, *"\[w\]ildfires are the second most important source of emissions in 2020"* and *"negate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from other sectors."* Some parts of South America have seen summer heat *in the winter*, with heatwaves with temperatures as high as 38 degrees [@livingstonItMidwinterIt2023].

In Taiwan disaster risk and hazard mapping is well-developed, with early warning systems, and comprehensive response preparedness - and painful experiences - instrumental to saving lives [@tsaiFrameworkEmergencyResponse2021]. Intensifying storms forming near coastlines, can be expected with *"\[c\]hanges to tropical cyclone trajectories in Southeast Asia under a warming climate"* [@garnerChangesTropicalCyclone2024]. The situation on the Pacific and Atlantic oceans is not dissimilar, with *"\[o\]bserved increases in North Atlantic tropical cyclone peak intensification rates"* [@garnerObservedIncreasesNorth2023].

In the Phillipines, with increasing extreme weather events, *"businesses are more likely to emerge in areas where infrastructure is resilient to climate hazards"* [@chengAssessingEconomicLoss2022].

Climate-related disasters can spur action as extreme weather becomes visible to everyone. After large floods in South Korea in July 2023 with many victims, president Joon promised to begin taking global warming seriously and steer the country towards climate action [@webSouthKoreaPresident2023; @afpKoreaPresidentVows2023; @aljazeeraDeathTollKorea2023]. South Korea has a partnership with the European Union [@europeancommissionEURepublicKorea2023].

## Financialization of Nature vs Nature's Sacred Value: How to Scale Up Sustainable Action

There are 2 main approaches to protecting nature:

|  |  |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Economics of Nature Commodification** | **Economics of the Sacred** |
| Measure and assign monetary value to nature. | Nature is Sacred - such as are religious holy places - and can't be touched [@eisensteinSacredEconomicsMoney2011; @eisensteinClimateNewStory2018] |

The question of whether we should we put a price on nature (or is it time to leave utilitarian environmentalism behind?) is still openly debated, with pro-financialization voices arguing assigning monetary figures to nature’s benefits legible to policymakers and markets, channeling large sums into conservation (e.g. carbon/biodiversity credits), while critics argue monetary metrics flatten relational, cultural and intrinsic values of ecosystems into exchange-value and commoditize nature, which may legitimize offsetting schemes that displace rather than prevent damage [@MonetaryValuationNature2023].

Ecosystem services literature defines a "Nature’s Contributions to People" framework, originally proposed by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). [@diazAssessingNaturesContributions2018]. [@muradianEcosystemServicesNature2021] critically assess the framework, arguing utilitarian and anthropocentric views of the ecosystem services concept perpetuates problematic dualisms (humans and nature are separate) - and call for a new approach centered on ecology.

: Concepts from [@MonetaryValuationNature2023].

A practical example of ecosystem services becoming a common language comes from [@zhangIntegratingEcosystemServices2023] who proposes integrating ecosystem services conservation into urban planning, so biodiversity could become part of city planning. Another example is tourism, a large industrial sector which relies on ecosystem services [@liDistinguishingImpactTourism2023]. In Taiwan, [@leeDevelopingIndicatorFramework2021] developed a framework of indicators to assess sustainable tourism.

### Ecological Restoration: Healing Damaged Ecosystems Through Agroforestry & Permaculture

The concept of how a public resource is over-used until breaking down as each user only bears a fraction of the cost - know as *tragedy of the commons* - was described by the ecologist Garrett Hardin in 1968 [@hardinTragedyCommonsPopulation1968; @meisingerTragedyIntangibleCommons2022; @lopezClimateChangeTimes2022; @muraseSevenRulesAvoid2018]. When so many systems are broken, some argue sustainability is not enough and we should work on *regeneration* of natural habitat. The UN announced 2021-2030 the Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, which includes a wide range of regenerative action [@fischerMakingDecadeEcosystem2021]. For instance, [@hanEmbeddingNaturebasedSolutions2022] identifies nature-based solutions "land re-naturalization (such as afforestation and wetland restoration)"

The organic food and drink market is growing worldwide, with gross sales in 2019 totalling over 106 billion euros, albeid being a small percentage of total food industry [@gamageRoleOrganicFarming2023]. Growing organic food poses many challenges, which farmers need to adapt to, in order to participate in regenerative food systems. One approach is growing food forests, also known as agroforestry, which integrates farming into natural environments, achieving CO2 storage in the soil through agriculture and forestry using agroecological practices.

In Ireland, [@irwinIncreasingTreeCover2023] studied dairy farmers' willingness to plant trees to increase vegetation cover on their land, finding that economic incentives alone are insufficient, and support in the form of advisory and education is needed. Similarly, in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest [@yadavExploringInnovationSustainable2023] finds the active participation of the local community in planning permaculture practices, enhances their acceptance and effectiveness. In Bangladesh, [@rubaPotentialityHomesteadAgroforestry2023] found agroforestry plays an active role in achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including zero hunger, climate action, mitigating climate change impacts through CO2 sequestration, life on land through biodiversity conservation and improving soil fertility, yet is hindered by the lack of policy support and educational level of the farmers. In the Baltic Sea region in North-Eastern Europe and Central Europe face similar challenges, [@balticseaactiongroupEITFoodRegenerative2023] pointing out farmers' traditional mindset as the biggest obstacle, describing the paradigm shift from extractive farming to regenerative agriculture, using techniques such as no-till farming, which reduces soil erosion and improve soil health by reducing synhetic imputs; yet, it's not only a single practice that is enough, regenerative agriculture is a holistic approach and agroecology education programmes need to be comprehehnsive.

[@lowMixedFarmingAgroforestry2023] futher studies how agroforestry deep integration into food value chains unlocks opportunties for recognition and rewards from economic actors in the network, underlining how complex and knowledge-heavy nature of value-capture, calling for further standardisation of practices to reward sustainability practices and ecosystem services. The challenge lies in that bioeconomy is not inherently sustainable and may put biodiversity at risk, depending on the level of industrialisation of agriculture and specific practices, which require deep knowledge and understanding of natural and artifical interactions the ecological systems; the authors advocate for a precise distinction between extractive and regenerative practices in "bioeconomy" [@ollinahoSeparatingTwoFaces2023]. Finally, taking Brazil as and example, [@dequeiroz-steinPossibilitiesMainstreamingBiodiversity2023] argues for an integration of competing and comflicting bioeconomy policies, in order to achieve the goals of a sustainable bioeconomy.

Svalbard Seed Vault is an example of seed conservation to safeguard biodiversity by storing backup seeds of plants from around the world in cold storage [@westengenGlobalExSituCrop2013; @asdalSvalbardGlobalSeed2018]. Since its opening in 2008, the storage solution provided by the Norwegian government has stored seeds from from 123 genebanks in 85 countries around the world [@newSeedSamples2025; @ArcticDoomsdaySeed2025]. [@vitalettiShareTinySpace2025] proposes using a blockchain-based lottery system to storage seeds in local refridgerators, in order to enhance resliance and ensure survivial of seeds, by storing seeds in many locations.

### Energy Production: "Climatech", Renewable Energy and Decarbonisation Pathways

Globally, 34% of all emissions come from energy production [@usepaGlobalGreenhouseGas2016], making it the key sector to require innovate for reducing carbon emissions. The International Energy Agency's (IEAs), "Tracking Clean Energy Progress" report on 50 distinct decarbonisation enablers and finds that only 3 components - solar PV, PV electric vehicles, and building lighting - are on track with the net zero by 2050 scenario, while 28 need more effort and 22 are "not on track" [@ieaTrackingCleanEnergy2023].

Geopolitical situations can affect technology adoption; after Russia's war in Ukraine, Europe needed to quickly reduce consuming cheap Russian fossil fuel energy (in the form of gas) [@bonasiaWindSolarEnergy2024]. In 2024, for first time in Europe, renewables in the form of wind and solar energy surged past production of fossil fuels [@grahamWindSolarOvertake2024; @beerWindSolarOvertake2024]. Meanwhile, China is experiencing a solar installation rush before a deadline set by a new renewable pricing policy; from January to April 2025, a record-breaking 105 gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity was installed, bringing the total solar power close to 1 TeraWatt, predicted to make solar power China's main energy source in 2026[@weaverTerawattSolarModule2023; @zhuChinasSolarCapacity2023; @lChinasRenewableEnergy2025; @redazioneSolarPowerChina2025; @carriexiaoChinaAddsRecord2025].

[@gaureTrueNotTrue2022] simulate a CO~2~ free electricity generation system in the European Union where "98% of total electricity production is generated by wind power and solar; the remainder is covered by a backup technology.". The authors stipulate it's possible to power the EU without producing CO~2~ emissions.

Wind and solar energy overtook fossil energy in Europe:

Globally, renewables also overtook fossil fuels [@ieaElectricityMidYearUpdate2024]:

Meanwhile, reduction in coal-power was also possible. Coal is a large CO2 emitter.

Large technology conglomerates and newly founded startups alike are working in the climate solutions space (often referred to as *climatech* by the media), have proposed a range of approaches to CO~2~ reduction in the Earth's atmosphere. These technologies include several types of *carbon capture*, directly from the air (direct air capture or DAC), from the source of pollution, such as using high–performance filters on factory chimneys, as well as nature-based solutions such as large scale tree planting using drones. Each technology has their own pros and cons. For instance, [@vitilloRoleCarbonCapture2022] illustrates how direct air capture of CO~2~ is difficult because of low concentration and CO~2~ capture at the source of the emissions is more feasible. [@cleantechgroupGlobalCleantech1002023] profiles 100 innovators across agriculture, food, energy, mobility, and waste that Cleantech Group judges most likely to enable a future with sub-2 degrees warming. Overall, considering pathways to carbon drawdown finds considerable uncertainty exists among experts which CO2 reduction among nature- and technology-based methods are the most effective [@lowRethinkingNetZeroSystems2022].

### Individual Action

Sometimes individual environmental (climate) action *does matter* and can come at great personal cost, even loss of life. EJAtlas tracks environmental justice cases around the world, where human stakes are very high [see coverage by @martinez-alierMappingEcologicalDistribution2021 and @martinez-alierReplyOrihuelaExtractivism2022 as well as @scheidelEnvironmentalConflictsDefenders2020].

However, for most of us individual climate action is *ineffective*. The effect of individual climate action such as *choosing a more sustainable product* is so limited to be next to meaningless. For individual consumer choices to make a difference, they need to be *aggregated* into a movement, collective action with scale, influence, and visibility.

There is no single solution to the environmental crisis. Given the enormity of environmental degradation, many different approaches are needed. This chapter documents some of the ongoing work which a sustainability companion could assist college students get involved with.

While the scale of climate change is too big for individual action to make a difference, individual action can foster hope and a sense of collective responsibility [@natureIndividualActionSystemic2020].
