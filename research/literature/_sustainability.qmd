# Sustainability

*"Nachhaltigkeit"* - *sustainability* in German - was likely the first use of the concept of preserving natural resources, conceived by a tax accountant Hannß Carl von Carlowitz in 1713 in his seminal book on forestry - *Sylvicultura oeconomica -*, referring to the goal of achieving prudent forest management practices in his native Saxony in Southeastern Germany, which at the time was under severe *deforestation* pressure from mining, ship-building and agricultural production [@hannsscarlvoncarlowitzSylviculturaOeconomicaOder1713; @gottschlichLegacySylviculturaOeconomica2014]. This particular field of sustainability study is now known as *sustainable yield of natural capital*. The *principal* of the natural resource being managed, such as in fishing and forestry, shouldn't be over-harvested in order to maintain ***ecosystem services*** - a contemporary term from the theory of *natural capital*, referring to benefits humans receive from the stock of world's natural resources [@peterkareivaNaturalCapitalTheory2011].

Defining sustainability perhaps more poetically, the American wildlife ecologist Aldo Leopold proposed the idea of *land ethics* in 1972 as *"\[a\] thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise"* in his landmark work *A Sand County Almanac* [@leopoldSandCountyAlmanac1972]. In a similar vein, the 1987 United Nations' Brundtland Report titled "*Our Common Future"* defined *sustainable development* as *"Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs"* [@worldcommissiononenvironmentanddevelopmentOurCommonFuture1987]. Given these varied ideas for over 300 years, I believe some percentage of people have been concerned with our planet's natural environment and its preservation already for centuries. Yet, it is only in the last 100 and so years that human activities have begun to affect Earth's systems on a previously unseen scale - termed *Anthropocene* -, necessitating a deeper understanding of human-nature interactions, such as in the case of climate change, which is rapidly changing the face of our living environments.

## Measuring and Visualizing Earth's Climate

Studies of Earth's climate go back for over 200 years, starting with Alexander von Humboldt,the founder of climatology, who revolutionized cartography by inventing the first *isothermal maps* in 1816; these maps showed areas with similar temperature, variations in altitude and seasons in different colors [@hontonForgottenFatherClimatology2022] now available as 3D computer models[@IsothermsSimplyEarth2023]. Already in 1896, the Nobel Prize winner Svante Arrhenius first calculated how an increase in CO~2~ levels could have a warming effect on our global climate [@andersonCO2GreenhouseEffect2016; @wulffPetterLegacy2020]. In 1938, Guy Stewart Callendar was the first scientist to demonstrate the warming of Earth's land surface as well as linking the production of fossil fuels to increased CO~2~e and changing climate [@hawkinsIncreasingGlobalTemperatures2013]. Early scientists pioneered climate modeling by calculating the first climate interactions which precede today's complex computer-based *Earth System Models (ESMs)* that integrate the various Earth systems and cycles run on supercomputers [@andersonCO2GreenhouseEffect2016].

```
Environmental activists have been calling attention to global warming for decades, yet the world has been slow to act [@mckibbenEndNature1989]. While the scientific case for human-induced climate change was building, it took 120 years after Arrhenius' calculations, until the Paris Climate Agreement in 2016, that countries came to an agreement on non-binding targets on keeping CO~2~ levels 1.5 °C below pre-industrial levels (defined as 1850–1900)[@unitednationsParisAgreement2016]. Even though awareness of Earth's warming climate was growing ever stronger, the CO~2~ emissions kept rising too. The hockey-stick growth of CO~2~ concentration since the industrial revolution is clear in the data from 1958 onward, following a steady annual increase, called the *Keeling Curve* [@keelingAtmosphericMonthlySitu2017]. Written records of global temperature measurements are available starting from the 1880s, when temperatures began to be documented in ship logs [@BrohanClimate2012]. Finally, although perhaps less accurately, temperature estimations from tree-trunks allow some comparisons with the climate as far back as 2000 years ago [@rubinoLawDomeIce2019].

The latest data from 2023 shows our current world population of 8 Billion people emitted 37.2 gigatonnes (i.e. billion metric tons) of CO~2~e per year, the highest emissions recorded in history [@statistaAnnualCO2Emissions2023]. In order to limit global warming to 1.5 °C as agreed by the world nations in Paris, removal of 5-20 gigatons of CO~2~e per year would be needed according to reduction pathways calculated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [@wadeMoisturedrivenCO2Pump2023]. Yet, most countries are missing the mark [@climateanalyticsClimateActionTracker2023; @unitednationsenvironmentprogrammeEmissionsGapReport2023]. The European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) reports 1.5 °C global warming has already been breached in 2024 temperatures [@WorldFirstYearlong2024; @FirstTimeWorld2024]. Given the current pace of climate change action, the G7 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, United States) are heading for 2.7 °C of warming by 2050 [@cdpMissingMarkCDP2022].

Earth's physical systems are very sensitive to small changes in temperature, which was not understood until the 1970s[@mckibbenEndNature2006]. A comprehensive review of evidence from paleoclimate records until current time, including ocean, atmosphere, and land surface of points towards substantial climate change if high levels of greenhouse gas emissions continue, termed by the authors as *climate sensitivity* [@sherwoodAssessmentEarthClimate2020]. Global warming may lead to the slowing down and complete stop of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) which helps maintain climate stability [@ditlevsenWarningForthcomingCollapse2023].

The most complex computer models which attempt to capture ever more interactions happening in the physical realm are called *digital twins.* The EU is developing a digital twin of Earth to help sustainability prediction and planning, integrating Earth's various systems such as climate, hydrology, ecology, etc, into a single model [@hoffmannDestinationEarthDigital2023 and @DestinationEarthShaping2023]. We can use all the data being recorded to provide a digital twin of the planet, nature, ecosystems and human actions to help us change our behavior and optimize for planetary wellbeing.

### Biosphere

Earth's biosphere is made up of 846 terrestrial ecoregions, which are distributed across 14 major biomes and 8 biogeographical realms [@dinersteinEcoregionBasedApproachProtecting2017].

### Ecological Indicators

Sustainability can be measured using a variety of *ecological indicators*.

Ecological indicators for Earth *- may I coin the name "ecomarkers" -* are like *biomarkers* in human health. Many technological advances help scientist better understand nature. Cutting edge research uses AI-based voice recognition for listening to nature, assessing biodiversity based on species' sounds in the forest. Millions of detections of different species with machine learning passive acoustic AI models, can also assess species' response to climate change [@aiforgoodListeningNatureHarnessing2023; @guerreroAcousticAnimalIdentification2023].

*Environmental DNA (eDNA)* helps scientists measure species abundance without direct observation through detection of DNA on genetic materials such as skin cells [@peterandreysmitharchivepageHowEnvironmentalDNA2024]. Cellular DNA can be isolated from various sediment types [@ogramExtractionPurificationMicrobial1987]. Beyond scientific applications, eDNa is being used to generate biodiversity credits by environmental asset rating companies such as BeZero [@ojoatreTriallingEDNABiodiversity2023].

AI is being used to map icebergs and measure the change in size [@europeanspaceagencyAIMapsIcebergs2023].

### Pricing, Tracing and Trading CO~2~e Emissions

### Financialization of Nature

-   thread of commodification of nature. category mistake. impossible to bring back already destroyed biodiversity which took millennia to develop. humans create hugely complex systems instead of simply conserving nature.

### Markets for Ecosystem Assets

While technology improves and measurements become more accurate, CO~2~e emissions are not yet completely accounted for. [@crippaFossilCO2GHG2020] reports latest figures CO~2~e from the EU's Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR). The EU Copernicus satellite system reveals new greenhouse emissions previously undetected [@danielvarjoNyaSatelliterAvslojar2022]. *Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) provides "\[n\]ear-real time updates of key global climate variables**"*** \*\*[@*\*thecopernicusclimatechangeserviceClimatePulse2024].

-   According to [@debnathSocialMediaEnables2022] 39% of global CO~2~ emissions comes from the building sector. Construction is large emitter because of the use of concrete; super tall buildings are very CO~2~ intensive [@zhaoEmbodiedCarbonBased2015]. Building emissions can be reduced by using sustainable design and materials, *digital twins* of architecture enable pre-visualization of different designs [@panaroHowCanPairing2024] as well modeling the usage of the building, for example the interior shop floors in commercial real-estate [@jiaSimpleDigitalTwin2023].

Emissions production is highly unequal. "The world's top 1% of emitters produce over 1000 times more CO2 than the bottom 1%" @ieaWorldTopEmitters2023

**Scoping**

*Scoping* CO~2e~ *emissions* into 4 main categories helps to organize calculating CO~2e~ emissions and corresponding reduction targets by looking at direct and indirect emissions separately. The U.S. National Public Utilities Council (NPUC) decarbonization report provides a useful categorization of *emission scopes* applicable to companies which helps organizing emission reduction schemes [@nationalpublicutilitiescouncilAnnualUtilityDecarbonization2022] based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol defined in the 1990s [@ghgprotocolUsGHGProtocol]. For example, for consumers in Australian states and territories in 2018, 83% of the GHG emissions are Scope 3, meaning indirect emissions in the value chain [@goodwinTargetingDegreesGlobal2023]. A newer concept is Scope 4 emissions also known as avoided emissions, proposed by the World Resources Institute (WRI) in 2013 [@planaWhatAreScope].

|                |                                |
|----------------|--------------------------------|
| Emission Scope | Emission Source                |
| Scope 1        | Direct emissions               |
| Scope 2        | Indirect electricity emissions |
| Scope 3        | Value chain emissions          |
| Scope 4        | Avoided emissions              |

-   CO~2e~ assigning a monetary value to carbon emissions.

Trading CO~2e~ emissions can be divided into 2 categories - *Compliance Carbon Markets* (CCM) and *Voluntary Carbon Markets* (VCM).

The legislative baseline for Compliance Carbon Markets is so low, people want to retire more CO~2e~, which they can do through *Voluntary Carbon Markets.*

For the individual person, there's no direct access to CO~2~ markets. However, brokers do buy large amounts of carbon credits to resell in smaller quantities to retail investors.

*"Carbon pricing is not there to punish people,"* says Lion Hirth @lionhirthLionHirthTwitter. *"It's there to remind us, when we take travel, heating, consumption decisions that the true cost of fossil fuels comprises not only mining and processing, but also the damage done by the CO~2~ they release."*

*Long term cost* of insufficient climate action is more than *short-term gains* from delaying efforts to reduce carbon emissions.

-   The total size of carbon markets reached 949 billion USD in 2023, including Chinese, European, and North American CO~2~ trading [@lsegGlobalCarbonMarkets2024].

-   *The price of* CO~2e~ *differs across markets.* [@sternCarbonNeutralEconomy2022] argues carbon-neutral economy needs higher CO~2e~ prices and believes [@rennertComprehensiveEvidenceImplies2022] CO~2e~ price per ton should be 3,6x higher that it is currently. Contrary, [@ritzGlobalCarbonPrice2022] argues optimal CO~2~ prices could be highly asymmetric, low in some countries and high (above the social cost of CO~2e~) in countries where production is very polluting.

-   @igeniusLetTalkSustainable2020

CO~2~ credits has given rise to *Carbon Accounting industry.*

-   Watershed is a large carbon accounting company.

-   The legislation has created an industry of CO~2~ accounting with many companies like Greenly, Sustaxo, etc.

-   @quatriniChallengesOpportunitiesScale2021 sustainability assessments are complex and may give flawed results.

-   Nonetheles, CO~2~ emission reduction has the added positive effect of boosting corporate morale [@caoImpactLoweringCarbon2023].

Compliance Carbon Markets

**Cap & Trade**

The share of CO~2~ emissions among people around the world is highly unequal across the world (referred to as ***Carbon Inequality***). [@chancelGlobalCarbonInequality2022] reports "one-tenth of the global population is responsible for nearly half of all emissions, half of the population emits less than 12%".

-   One example is the ICT sector.

    -   @zhouCarboneconomicInequalityGlobal2022 ICT is an example of inequality, while emerging economies bear 82% of the emissions, developed countries gain 58% of value.

**Emissions Trading Schemes**

"The Emissions Gap Report (EGR) 2021: The Heat Is On shows that new national climate pledges combined with other mitigation measures put the world on track for a global temperature rise of 2.7°C by the end of the century. That is well above the goals of the Paris climate agreement and would lead to catastrophic changes in the Earth's climate. To keep global warming below 1.5°C this century, the aspirational goal of the Paris Agreement, the world needs to halve annual greenhouse gas emissions in the next eight years.

-   [@unitednationsenvironmentprogrammeunepEmissionsGapReport2021] report "If implemented effectively, net-zero emissions pledges could limit warming to 2.2°C, closer to the well-below 2°C goal of the Paris Agreement. However, many national climate plans delay action until after 2030. The reduction of methane emissions from the fossil fuel, waste and agriculture sectors could help close the emissions gap and reduce warming in the short term, the report finds. Carbon markets could also help slash emissions. But that would only happen if rules are clearly defined and target actual reductions in emissions, while being supported by arrangements to track progress and provide transparency."

### Consumerism \> Earth's Boundaries

Earth's growing population reached 8 Billion people In November 2022 and population projections by predict 8.5B people by 2030 and 9.7B by 2050 [@theeconomictimesClimateChangeEarth2022; @unWorldPopulationProspects2022]. While population growth puts higher pressure on Earth's resources, some researchers propose the effect is higher from wasteful lifestyles than the raw number of people [@cardinaleBiodiversityLossIts2012] while others such as [@cafaroOverpopulationMajorCause2022] believe *"Overpopulation is a major cause of biodiversity loss and smaller human populations are necessary to preserve what is left"* .

Making *anything* consumes natural resources, which are limited on planet Earth.

Environmental risks from human activities are known as Anthropogenic Threat Complexes (ATCs) [@bowlerMappingHumanPressures2020]*.*

-   @jacksonProsperityGrowthFoundations2017 limits to growth update

Consumer lifestyle - overconsumption - is one of the main drivers of climate change and environmental destruction. "2/3 of global GHG emissions are directly and indirectly linked to household consumption, with a global average of about 6 tonnes CO~2~ equivalent per capita" [@reneechoHowBuyingStuff2020; @ivanovaQuantifyingPotentialClimate2020]. [@hassounFoodProcessingCurrent2023] forecasts increase of global food demand by 62% including impact of climate change. According to [@ellenmacarthurfoundationmaterialeconomicsCompletingPictureHow2019]'s models 45% of CO~2~ equivalent emissions come from our shopping; produced by companies to make the products we consume.

Overconsumption is also one of the root causes of plastic pollution. [@FORD2022150392] and [@laversFarDistractionPlastic2022] find strong links between climate change and marine plastic pollution *"along with other stressors that threaten the resilience of species and habitats sensitive to both climate change and plastic pollution"*. [@laversFarDistractionPlastic2022] plastic pollution is pervasive around the Earth and is fundamentally linked to climate change.

A large scale study by @anthonyleiserowitzInternationalPublicOpinion2022 on Meta's Facebook (n=108946) reported people in Spain (65%), Sweden (61%), and Taiwan (60%) believe *"climate change is mostly caused by human activities".* An even larger survey (n=1.2 million) by the United Nations across 50 countries, distributed through mobile game ads, showed the majority of people agreeing climate change is an "emergency" [@undpPeoplesClimateVote2021]. While people express eco-conscious ideas, it's non-trivial to practice sustainability in daily life. [@deyangeorgievGenStatisticsWhat2023] reports only 30% of people in the Gen-Z age group believe technology can solve all problems.

In 1948, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) was founded, which in

LULUCF "Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry" can both be a source of greenhouse gas emissions - or a carbon sink (removing CO2 from the atmosphere).

As long as humanity is a mono-planetary species, we have to come to terms with the limitations of our home, Earth.

### Earth System Law, Planetary Health, and Social Cost of CO~2~

Cross-disciplinary scientists have been working on integrating Earth systems and human society into cohesive frameworks. *Planetary Health*, *Earth System Law, and* Social Cost of Carbon are 3 approaches to address the complex interdependence of humans with our physical environment.

Evolving Measurements from Planetary Boundaries to Planetary Health

-   Planetary health [@planetaryhealthalliancePlanetaryHealth2024; @planetaryhealthalliancePlanetaryHealthRoadmap2024]

-   @wardaniBoundariesSpacesKnowledge2023 *"long-term human well-being is dependent on the well-being of the planet, including both biotic and abiotic systems. It recognizes interlinkages across environmental sustainability, public health, and socioeconomic development."*

-   [@dutoitReimaginingInternationalEnvironmental2022] describes *Earth System Law* as a framework for addressing interconnected environmental challenges.

Earth system science

Social Cost of Carbon Measures Compound CO~2~ Impact. Sustainability is filled with complexities. CO~2~ emissions are complicated by biodiversity loss, child labor, slavery, poverty, chemical pollution, etc. - many issues become intertwined [@tedxSustainableBusinessFrank2020]. One attempt to measure these complexities, is the *Social Cost of Carbon* (SCC) which is defined as *"additional damage caused by an extra unit of emissions"* [@kornekSocialCostCarbon2021; @zhenSimpleEstimateSocial2018]. For example the cost of damages caused by "one extra ton of carbon dioxide emissions" [@stanforduniversityProfessorsExplainSocial2021]. SCC variations exist between countries [@tolSocialCostCarbon2019] and regions [@wangMeasurementChinaProvincial2022].

-   As shown in the Phillipines by [@chengAssessingEconomicLoss2022], with increasing extreme weather events, *"businesses are more likely to emerge in areas where infrastructure is resilient to climate hazards"*. [@jerrettSmokeCaliforniaGreenhouse2022] says, In California, "Wildfires are the second most important source of emissions in 2020" and "Wildfires in 2020 negate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from other sectors."

-   [@linOpportunitiesTackleShortlived2022] says, apart from CO~2~, reduction of other atmospheric pollutants, such as non-CO~2~ greenhouse gases (GHGs) and short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) is required for climate stability.

-   [@wangMultimodelAssessmentClimate2022]: Quantifying climate damage proposes scenarios of climate damage.

## Ecosystem Services

*Ecosystem services measure the benefits humans receive from the biosphere.* Put most simply, *ecosystem services* enable human life on Earth. While it can be assumed much of the flora and fauna are crucial for Earth's systems, science is still in the process of understanding and quantifying its contributions. The history of the valuation of nature's services goes back to the 18th century when David Ricardo and Jean Baptiste Say discussed nature's *work*, however both considered it should be free [@historyEcosystemServices2010]. In 1997 [@dailyNatureServicesSocietal1997] proposed the idea of *ecosystem services* and [@costanzaValueWorldEcosystem1997] attempted to assess the amount of ecosystem services provided. [@leprovostSupplyMultipleEcosystem2022]'s study shows *biodiversity* as one key factor to maintain delivery of ecosystem services. [@noriegaResearchTrendsEcosystem2018] attempts to quantify the ecosystem services (ES) provided by insects.

Why Protect Biodiversity?

@mayWhyShouldWe2011 argues biodiversity loss is a concern for 3 points of views:

|  |  |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| View |  |
| Narrowly Utilitarian | Biodiversity is a resource of genetic novelties for the biotech industry. |
| Broadly Utilitarian | Humans depend upon biodiverse ecosystems. |
| Ethical | Humans have a responsibility to future generations to pass down a rich natural world. |

: From @mayWhyShouldWe2011.

-   [@MonetaryValuationNature2023] asks should we put a price on nature?
-   Is it time to leave utilitarian environmentalism behind? @muradianEcosystemServicesNature2021

**Measuring Environmental Degradation**

### Biodiversity

[@livingPlanetReport2022] reported, the number of species killed, mass destruction of nature. "69% decline in the relative abundance of monitored wildlife populations around the world between 1970 and 2018. Latin America shows the greatest regional decline in average population abundance (94%), while freshwater species populations have seen the greatest overall global decline (83%)."

```{python}
biodiversity_chart()
```

Biodiversity loss is linked to overconsumption, weak legislation and lack of oversight. [@crennaBiodiversityImpactsDue2019] recounts European Union consumers' negative impact on biodiversity in countries where it imports food. @wwfForestsReducingEU2022 case study highlights how 4 biodiverse regions Cerrado in Brazil, Chaco in Argentina, Sumatra in Indonesia, and the Cuvette Centrale in Democratic Republic of Congo are experiencing rapid destruction due to consumer demand in the European Union. While the European Union (EU) has recently become a leader in sustainability legislation, biodiversity protection measures among private companies is very low @marco-fondevilaTrendsPrivateSector2023.

Meanwhile, there is some progress in biodiversity conservation. @uebtBiodiversityBarometer2022 reports "Biodiversity awareness is now at 72% or higher in all countries sampled, compared to only 29% or higher across countries sampled in 2009."

**Convention on Biodiversity**

Similarly to climate protection, the UN has taken a leadership role in biodiversity protection. @unitHistoryConvention2023: The history of the United Nations Convention on Biodiversity goes back to 1988, when the working group was founded. @unepCOP15EndsLandmark2022: The Convention on Biodiversity 2022 (COP15) adopted the first global biodiversity framework to accompany climate goals.

**Marine Heatwaves**

-   [@smaleMarineHeatwavesThreaten2019 and @gellesOceanDireMessage2023] describe how marine heatwaves threaten global biodiversity. Ocean warming leads to coral bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland, east coast of Australia [@pfeifferCoralGiantsSound2024].

### Deforestion

Around 27% of Earth's land area is still covered by forests yet deforestation is widespread all around the world; highest rates of deforestation happened in the tropical rainforests of South America and Africa, mainly caused by agricultural cropland expansion (50% of all deforestation) and grazing land for farm animals to produce meat (38,5%), totaling close to 90% of global deforestation [@FRA2020Remote2022]. Forests are a crucial part of Earth's carbon cycle and the main natural CO~2~ capture system; due to deforestation, Europe rapidly losing its forest carbon sink [@fredericsimonEuropeRapidlyLosing2022].

-   Global Forest Cover Change, Earth Engine @hansenHighResolutionGlobalMaps2013
-   Burning of biomass undermines carbon capture.

### Pollution

**Air Pollution**

Air pollution is widespread around the planet, with 99% of Earth's human population being affected by bad air quality that does not meet WHO air quality guidelines, leading to health problems linked to 6.7 million premature deaths every year [@worldhealthorganizationAmbientOutdoorAir2022]. Grounbreaking research by [@lim1MOAirPollutioninduced2022] analyzed over 400000 individuals in England, South Korea and Taiwan establishes exposure to 2.5μm PM (PM2.5) air pollution as a cause for lung cancer. [@bouscasseDesigningLocalAir2022] finds strong health and economic benefits across the board from air pollution reduction in France. In [@hannahdevlinCancerBreakthroughWakeup2022], professor Tony Mok, of the Chinese University of Hong Kong: *"We have known about the link between pollution and lung cancer for a long time, and we now have a possible explanation for it. As consumption of fossil fuels goes hand in hand with pollution and carbon emissions, we have a strong mandate for tackling these issues -- for both environmental and health reasons"*.

Health and sustainability are inextricably linked. "Human health is central to all sustainability efforts.", "All of these (food, housing, power, and health care), and the stress that the lack of them generate, play a huge role in our health" [@sarahludwigrauschSustainabilityYourHealth2021].

The main way to combat air pollution is through policy interventions. [@marialuisfernandesRealityCheckIndustrial2023] the EU has legislation in progress to curb industrial emissions. If legislation is in place, causing bad air quality can become bad for business. @guHiddenCostsNongreen2023 links air pollution to credit interest rates for business loans in China; companies with low environmental awareness and a history of environmental penalties pay 12 percent higher interest rates.

Clean air is a requirement.

**Water Pollution**

-   Bioswales help catch storm debris and reduce water pollution.
-   Clean water and water pollution
-   @kochOpinionArizonaRace2022 (**Need access! NYC times)**
-   Paris cleans Seine river for Paris Olympics

**Soil Pollution**

-   "Wild and ruderal plants as bioindicators of global urban pollution by air, water and soil in Riyadh and Abha, Saudi Arabia" [@picoWildRuderalPlants2023] uses Wild and ruderal plants to detect pollution by air, water and soil. Bioindicators of anthropogenic pollution, Pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and other industrial chemicals. Both Abha and Riyadh showed notable levels of pollutants while Riyadh with more industry showed higher levels.

### Weather

Extreme Weather

-   [@FifthNationalClimate2023] The US Global Change Research Program comprehensive report to the US Congress links disaster-risk directly to global warming; for examples increased wildfires damage property, endanger life and reduces air quality, which in effect increases health challenges.
-   "Changes to tropical cyclone trajectories in Southeast Asia under a warming climate" @garnerChangesTropicalCyclone2024
-   "Observed increases in North Atlantic tropical cyclone peak intensification rates" @garnerObservedIncreasesNorth2023
-   Flood risk mapping might lower property prices in at risk areas [@sherrenFloodRiskMapping2024].
-   In Taiwan disaster risk and hazard mapping, early warning systems, and comprehensive response save lives [@tsaiFrameworkEmergencyResponse2021].

Global warming increases the risk of disasters and extreme weather events. As extreme temperatures are increasingly commonplace, there's increased risk of wildfires [@volkovaEffectsPrescribedFire2021]. Summers of 2022 and 2023 were the hottest on record so far, with extreme heat waves recorded in places around the world [@venturelliHighTemperatureCOVID192023; @serrano-notivoliUnprecedentedWarmthLook2023; @douglasThisSummerTrack2023; @EarthJustHad2023; @NOAAJune2023; @falconer123MillionHeat2023]. As temperatures rise, certain cities may become uninhabitable for humans [@cbcradioExtremeHeatCould2021]. The summer of 2023 saw extensive wildfires in Spain, Canada, and elsewhere; rapidly moving fires destroyed the whole city of Lāhainā in Hawaii \[ADD CITATION\]. The part of Earth where the *human climate niche* is becoming smaller [@mckibbenWhereShouldLive2023]. Some parts of South America have seen summer heat in the winter, with heatwaves with temperatures as high as 38 degrees [@livingstonItMidwinterIt2023].

## Sustainable Action

-   The concept of how a public resource is over-used until breaking down as each user only bears a fraction of the cost - know as *tragedy of the commons* -was described by the ecologist Garrett Hardin in 1968 [@hardinTragedyCommonsPopulation1968; @meisingerTragedyIntangibleCommons2022; @lopezClimateChangeTimes2022; @muraseSevenRulesAvoid2018].

### Does Individual Climate Action Matter?

Does Individual Climate Action is Ineffective.

The effect of individual climate action is limited.

Regenerative Action

There is no single solution to the environmental crisis. Given the enormity of environmental degradation, many different approaches are needed. This chapter documents some of the ongoing work which a sustainability companion could assist college students get involved with.

### Restoration Ecology, Agroforestry & Permaculture

Some argue sustainability is not enough and we should work on *regeneration* of natural habitats.

The UN announced 2021-2030 the Decade on Ecosystem Restoration [@fischerMakingDecadeEcosystem2021].

**Technology**

"Climatech", Renewable Energy and Transforming Energy Production

Fossil fuels are what powers humanity as well as the largest source of CO~2~ emissions. @ieaGlobalEnergyReview2022 reports "Global CO~2~ emissions from energy combustion and industrial processes rebounded in 2021 to reach their highest ever annual level. A 6% increase from 2020 pushed emissions to 36.3 gigatonnes". As on June 2023, fossil fuel based energy makes up 82% of energy and is still growing @instituteEnergySystemStruggles2023. The 425 largest fossil fuel projects represent a total of over 1 gigatons in CO~2~ emissions, 40% of which were new projects @kuhneCarbonBombsMapping2022. @tilstedEndingFossilbasedGrowth2023 expects the fossil fuel industry to continue grow even faster. In July 2023, the U.K. granted hundreds of new oil and gas of project licenses in the North Sea [@RishiSunakGreenlight2023].

Large technology conglomerates and newly founded startups focused on climate solutions (often referred to as *climatech* by the media) have proposed a range of approaches to CO~2~ reduction in the atmosphere. These technologies include several types of *carbon capture*, directly from the air (direct air capture or DAC), from the source of pollution, such as using high–performance filters on factory chimneys, as well as nature-based solutions such as large scale tree planting using drones.

Each technology has their own pros and cons. [@vitilloRoleCarbonCapture2022] illustrates how direct air capture of CO~2~ is difficult because of low concentration and CO~2~ capture at the source of the emissions is more feasible.

-   [@gaureTrueNotTrue2022] simulate a CO~2~ free electricity generation system in the European Union where "98% of total electricity production is generated by wind power and solar; the remainder is covered by a backup technology.". The authors stipulate it's possible to power the EU without producing CO~2~ emissions.

-   **Important: "creating sustainability trust in companies in realtime"**

-   @howardPotentialIntegrateBlue2017 argues Oceans play crucial role in carbon capture.

### Political Action

-   **10 countries use almost 100% renewable energy**

There's ample evidence from several countries suggesting moving to renewal energy brings environmental benefits:

-   @AMIN2022113224 suggests "removing fossil fuel subsidies and intra-sectoral electricity price distortions coupled with carbon taxes provides the highest benefits" for both the economy and the environment in Bangladesh.

-   @luoControllingCommercialCooling2022 suggests using reinforcement learning to reduce energy use in cooling systems.

-   The true cost of products is hidden. The work is hidden.

-   Montreal protocol eradicates CfCs and the ozone holes became whole again.

***Mitigating*** **Climate Change**

The monumental task of removing several gigatons of CO~2~ from the atmosphere requires massive policy shifts and collaboration across countries and industries [@macklerPolicyAgendaGigatonscale2021].

Warming global climate has concrete effects on daily life. Warmer climate helps viruses and fungi spread [@pressFungalDiseaseRapidly2023]. [@williamsIntensificationWinterTransatlantic2013] higher CO~2~ concentrations in the air can cause more turbulence for flights.

***Adapting*** **to Climate Change**

Many companies are developing technologies for mitigation.

In Brazil, deforestation fell 60% in 1 year, based on remote satellite reconnaissance, after the election of a more pro-environment leadership [@wattsAmazonDeforestationFalls2023].

We have an opportunity to re-imagine how every product can be an eco-product and how they circulate in our circular economy.

Timeline of the Policy Context:

-   In 2019 by the von der Leyen commission adopted the European Union (EU) **Green Deal** strategy.

-   In 2021 the Commision proposed a goal of reducing CO2e emissions by 55% by 2030 under the *Fit for 55* policy package consisting of a wide range of economic measures.

-   In November 2022, the proposal was adopted by the EU Council and EU Parliament with an updated goal of 57% of CO2e reductions compared to 1990. This proposal is set to become a binding law for all EU member countries (@europeancommissionEuropeanGreenDeal2019; @europeancommissionSustainableEurope20302019; @EUReachesAgreement2022; @europeancouncilFit55EU2022).

-   In March 2022, the EU Circular Economy Action Plan was adopted, looking to make sustainable products *the norm* in EU and *empowering consumers* as described in @europeancommissionCircularEconomyAction2022. Each product covered by the policy is required to have a ***Digital Product Passport*** which enables improved processing within the supply chain and includes detailed information to empower consumers to understand the environmental footprint of their purchases. It's safe to say the large majority of products available today do not meet these criteria.
