## The Roots of Sustainability in Environmentalism

*"Nachhaltigkeit"* - *sustainability* in German - was likely the first use of the concept of preserving natural resources, conceived by a tax accountant Hannß Carl von Carlowitz in 1713 in his seminal book on forestry - *Sylvicultura oeconomica -*, referring to the goal of achieving prudent forest management practices in his native Saxony in Southeastern Germany, which at the time was under severe *deforestation* pressure from mining, ship-building and agricultural production [@hannsscarlvoncarlowitzSylviculturaOeconomicaOder1713; @gottschlichLegacySylviculturaOeconomica2014]. This particular field of sustainability study is now known as *sustainable yield of natural capital*. The *principal* of the natural resource being managed, such as in fishing and forestry, shouldn't be over-harvested in order to maintain ***ecosystem services*** - a contemporary term from the theory of *natural capital*, referring to benefits humans receive from the stock of world's natural resources [@peterkareivaNaturalCapitalTheory2011].

Defining sustainability perhaps more poetically, the American wildlife ecologist Aldo Leopold proposed the idea of *land ethics* in 1972 as *"\[a\] thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise"* in his landmark work *A Sand County Almanac* [@leopoldSandCountyAlmanac1972]. In a similar vein, the 1987 United Nations' Brundtland Report titled "*Our Common Future"* defined *sustainable development* as *"Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs"* [@worldcommissiononenvironmentanddevelopmentOurCommonFuture1987]. Given these varied ideas for over 300 years, I believe some percentage of people have been concerned with our planet's natural environment and its preservation already for centuries. Yet, it is only in the last 100 and so years that human activities have begun to affect Earth's systems on a previously unseen scale - termed *Anthropocene* -, necessitating a deeper understanding of human-nature interactions, such as in the case of climate change, which is rapidly changing the face of our living environments.

## Measuring and Visualizing Earth's Climate Systems

Studies of Earth's climate go back for over 200 years, starting with Alexander von Humboldt,the founder of climatology, who revolutionized cartography by inventing the first *isothermal maps* in 1816; these maps showed areas with similar temperature, variations in altitude and seasons in different colors [@hontonForgottenFatherClimatology2022] now available as 3D computer models[@IsothermsSimplyEarth2023]. Already in 1896, the Nobel Prize winner Svante Arrhenius first calculated how an increase in CO~2~ levels could have a warming effect on our global climate [@andersonCO2GreenhouseEffect2016; @wulffPetterLegacy2020]. In 1938, Guy Stewart Callendar was the first scientist to demonstrate the warming of Earth's land surface as well as linking the production of fossil fuels to increased CO~2~e and changing climate [@hawkinsIncreasingGlobalTemperatures2013]. Early scientists pioneered climate modeling by calculating the first climate interactions which precede today's complex computer-based *Earth System Models (ESMs)* that integrate the various Earth systems and cycles run on supercomputers [@andersonCO2GreenhouseEffect2016].

```
Environmental activists have been calling attention to global warming for decades, yet the world has been slow to act [@mckibbenEndNature1989]. While the scientific case for human-induced climate change was building, it took 120 years after Arrhenius' calculations, until the Paris Climate Agreement in 2016, that countries came to an agreement on non-binding targets on keeping CO~2~ levels 1.5 °C below pre-industrial levels (defined as 1850–1900)[@unitednationsParisAgreement2016]. Even though awareness of Earth's warming climate was growing ever stronger, the CO~2~ emissions kept rising too. The hockey-stick growth of CO~2~ concentration since the industrial revolution is clear in the data from 1958 onward, following a steady annual increase, called the *Keeling Curve* [@keelingAtmosphericMonthlySitu2017]. Written records of global temperature measurements are available starting from the 1880s, when temperatures began to be documented in ship logs [@BrohanClimate2012]. Finally, although perhaps less accurately, temperature estimations from tree-trunks allow some comparisons with the climate as far back as 2000 years ago [@rubinoLawDomeIce2019].

Keeling Curve funding is Ralph Keeling is under thread, Scripps Institue

The apparatures measures the absorbion of infrared light, which allows one to detect the amount of CO2 in the air. It also has an advanced calibration system where it makes measurements in air with a known quantity of gases. @worthingtonMakingAmericaDumb2025

The latest data from 2023 shows our current world population of 8 Billion people emitted 37.2 gigatonnes (i.e. billion metric tons) of CO~2~e per year, the highest emissions recorded in history [@statistaAnnualCO2Emissions2023]. In order to limit global warming to 1.5 °C as agreed by the world nations in Paris, removal of 5-20 gigatons of CO~2~e per year would be needed according to reduction pathways calculated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [@wadeMoisturedrivenCO2Pump2023]. Yet, most countries are missing the mark [@climateanalyticsClimateActionTracker2023; @unitednationsenvironmentprogrammeEmissionsGapReport2023]. The European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) reports 1.5 °C global warming has already been breached in 2024 temperatures [@WorldFirstYearlong2024; @FirstTimeWorld2024]. Given the current pace of climate change action, the G7 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, United States) are heading for 2.7 °C of warming by 2050 [@cdpMissingMarkCDP2022].

Earth's physical systems are very sensitive to small changes in temperature, which was not understood until the 1970s[@mckibbenEndNature2006]. A comprehensive review of evidence from paleoclimate records until current time, including ocean, atmosphere, and land surface of points towards substantial climate change if high levels of greenhouse gas emissions continue, termed by the authors as *climate sensitivity* [@sherwoodAssessmentEarthClimate2020]. Global warming may lead to the slowing down and complete stop of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) which helps maintain climate stability [@ditlevsenWarningForthcomingCollapse2023].

### Measuring CO~2~e Emissions

Technology improves and measurements have become more accurate yet CO~2~e emissions are not yet completely accounted for. [@crippaFossilCO2GHG2020] reports the latest figures CO~2~e from the EU's Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR). The EU Copernicus satellite system reveals new greenhouse emissions previously undetected [@danielvarjoNyaSatelliterAvslojar2022]. *Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) provides "\[n\]ear-real time updates of key global climate variables*"[@thecopernicusclimatechangeserviceClimatePulse2024].

-   \[\@matthewgoreEmissionsRegulationsShipping2022\] reports the International Maritime Organization (IMO) targets cutting CO~2~ equivalent emissions in shipping 50% by 2050 compared to 2008.

Emissions production is highly unequal, with *"\[t\]he world's top 1% of emitters produce over 1000 times more CO2 than the bottom 1%"* [@ieaWorldTopEmitters2023]

CO~2~e emissions by region (per year).

|----------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| **Regional Average Per Capita Emissions (2020)** | **Highest Per Capita Emissions (2021)** | **Highest Total Emissions (2021)** |

: Comparing highest per capita CO~2e~ emissions (mostly from oil producers) vs regional average per capita CO~2~ emissions vs total CO~2~ emissions[@ivanovaQuantifyingPotentialClimate2020; @worldresourcesinstituteCO2EmissionsMetric2020; @europeancommission.jointresearchcentre.CO2EmissionsAll2022; @crippaFossilCO2GHG2020; @liuMonitoringGlobalCarbon2023].

*Scoping* CO~2e~ *emissions* into 4 main categories helps to organize calculating CO~2e~ emissions and corresponding reduction targets by looking at direct and indirect emissions separately. The U.S. National Public Utilities Council (NPUC) decarbonization report provides a useful categorization of *emission scopes* applicable to companies which helps organizing emission reduction schemes [@nationalpublicutilitiescouncilAnnualUtilityDecarbonization2022] based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol defined in the 1990s [@ghgprotocolUsGHGProtocol]. For example, for consumers in Australian states and territories in 2018, 83% of the GHG emissions are Scope 3, meaning indirect emissions in the value chain [@goodwinTargetingDegreesGlobal2023]. A newer concept is Scope 4 emissions also known as avoided emissions, proposed by the World Resources Institute (WRI) in 2013 [@planaWhatAreScope].

|                |                                |

| Emission Scope | Emission Source                |
| Scope 1        | Direct emissions               |
| Scope 2        | Indirect electricity emissions |
| Scope 3        | Value chain emissions          |
| Scope 4        | Avoided emissions              |

-   Power generation is one of the largest polluters; Google worked with the government of Taiwan to change the laws to allow direct power procurement by foreign companies; the current plan being to install 1 gigawatt of solar power fully pre-purchased by the newly formed company created by BlackRock and Google for boosting AI development as reported by [@jessopGoogleBuysStake2024; @chiangGoogleInvestsBlackRockbacked2024; @YongXinNengYuannewgreenpowerBlackRockAcquire1002022].

While most countries have not reached their Nationally Determined Contributions, the Climate Action Tracker data portal allows to compare countries [@climateanalyticsClimateActionTracker2023]. [@fransenStateNationallyDetermined2022] notes that the majority of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are dependent on financial assistance from the international community.

Fossil fuels are what powers humanity as well as the largest source of CO~2~ emissions. @ieaGlobalEnergyReview2022 reports "Global CO~2~ emissions from energy combustion and industrial processes rebounded in 2021 to reach their highest ever annual level. A 6% increase from 2020 pushed emissions to 36.3 gigatonnes". As on June 2023, fossil fuel based energy makes up 82% of energy and is still growing @instituteEnergySystemStruggles2023. The 425 largest fossil fuel projects represent a total of over 1 gigatons in CO~2~ emissions, 40% of which were new projects @kuhneCarbonBombsMapping2022. @tilstedEndingFossilbasedGrowth2023 expects the fossil fuel industry to continue grow even faster. In July 2023, the U.K. granted hundreds of new oil and gas of project licenses in the North Sea [@RishiSunakGreenlight2023].

### Markets for Ecosystem Services: Pricing, Tracing, and Trading Nature's Assets

Markets for ecosystems assets are centered around *carbon credits*, a type of nature-backed financial derivative dependent on science-based methodologies for measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV), which are managed and regularly updated by certification organizations such as Gold Standard, Verra, and others.

| Criteria | Description |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Baseline | Ecosystem carbon sequestration rate without the intervention (project) |
| Additionality | New carbon capture or prevention of emissions |
| Permanence | Carbon storage time (should be long-term) |
| Leakage | Risk of shift to causing emissions (for example because of deforestation) |

: Criteria for carbon credit projects.

Verra updated their Agricultural Land Management methodology for Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) last year [@verraVerraReleasesRevised2023]. Gold Standard recently release a methodology for Mangrove-based carbon credits \[ADD CITATION\].

CO~2e~ assigning a monetary value to carbon emissions.

Trading CO~2e~ emissions can be divided into 2 categories - *Compliance Carbon Markets* (CCM) and *Voluntary Carbon Markets* (VCM).

The legislative baseline for Compliance Carbon Markets is so low, people want to retire more CO~2e~, which they can do through *Voluntary Carbon Markets.*

For the individual person, there's no direct access to CO~2~ markets. However, brokers do buy large amounts of carbon credits to resell in smaller quantities to retail investors.

*"Carbon pricing is not there to punish people,"* says Lion Hirth @lionhirthLionHirthTwitter. *"It's there to remind us, when we take travel, heating, consumption decisions that the true cost of fossil fuels comprises not only mining and processing, but also the damage done by the CO~2~ they release."*

*Long term cost* of insufficient climate action is more than *short-term gains* from delaying efforts to reduce carbon emissions.

-   The total size of carbon markets reached 949 billion USD in 2023, including Chinese, European, and North American CO~2~ trading [@lsegGlobalCarbonMarkets2024].

-   *The price of* CO~2e~ *differs across markets.* [@sternCarbonNeutralEconomy2022] argues carbon-neutral economy needs higher CO~2e~ prices and believes [@rennertComprehensiveEvidenceImplies2022] CO~2e~ price per ton should be 3,6x higher that it is currently. Contrary, [@ritzGlobalCarbonPrice2022] argues optimal CO~2~ prices could be highly asymmetric, low in some countries and high (above the social cost of CO~2e~) in countries where production is very polluting.

-   @igeniusLetTalkSustainable2020

The fossil energy production that's a large part of global CO2 emissions has caused several high-profile pollution events. Large ones that got international news coverage include Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon.

Google purchases 10MW of geothermal energy for its Taiwanese AI chip projects, doubling current Taiwanese geothermal capacity [@wuGoogleAnnouncesMilestone2025; @potterGoogleJustFlipped2025; @hagstrom-ilievskaMajorStepGeothermal2025]. Geothermal energy provides 24/7 clean energy from the Earth's core, however is limited due to lack of acccess; Taiwan happens to be in geologically active spot on the ring of fire, where drilling for geothermal energy is more feasible [@lGoogleIgnitesTaiwans2025; @changOurFirstGeothermal2025].

CO~2e~ credits has given rise to *Carbon Accounting industry.*

-   Watershed is a large carbon accounting company.

-   The legislation has created an industry of CO~2~ accounting with many companies like Greenly, Sustaxo, etc.

-   @quatriniChallengesOpportunitiesScale2021 sustainability assessments are complex and may give flawed results.

-   Nonetheles, CO~2~ emission reduction has the added positive effect of boosting corporate morale [@caoImpactLoweringCarbon2023].

Compliance Carbon Markets

**Cap & Trade**

The share of CO~2~ emissions among people around the world is highly unequal across the world (referred to as ***Carbon Inequality***). [@chancelGlobalCarbonInequality2022] reports "one-tenth of the global population is responsible for nearly half of all emissions, half of the population emits less than 12%".

-   One example is the ICT sector.

-   @bajarinPCSalesAre Over 300 million PCs sold in 2022

    -   @GreenDiceReinventingIdea2021 Estonian company "sustainable lifecycle management of IT equipment"
    -   @arilehtKestlikkuseSuunanaitajadSaadavad2022 Recycle your phone, FoxWay and Circular economy for PCs.
    -   @zhouCarboneconomicInequalityGlobal2022 ICT is an example of inequality, while emerging economies bear 82% of the emissions, developed countries gain 58% of value.

**Emissions Trading Schemes**

From Carbon Offsets to Carbon Credits

-   "A carbon credit represents one tonne of carbon dioxide that has been prevented from entering or has been removed from the atmosphere" [@annawatsonCarbonCreditRetirements2023; @annawatsonCarbonDioxideRemoval2022].

Retiring CO~2~ allowances

-   Facilitating citizens' access to CO~2~ emissions trading may be an efficient method to organize large-scale CO~2~ retiring [@rousseEnvironmentalEconomicBenefits2008].

As of 2024 there's no single global CO~2~ trading market but rather several local markets as described in the table below.

-   [@unitednationsenvironmentprogrammeunepEmissionsGapReport2021] report. "The Emissions Gap Report (EGR) 2021: The Heat Is On shows that new national climate pledges combined with other mitigation measures put the world on track for a global temperature rise of 2.7°C by the end of the century. That is well above the goals of the Paris climate agreement and would lead to catastrophic changes in the Earth's climate. To keep global warming below 1.5°C this century, the aspirational goal of the Paris Agreement, the world needs to halve annual greenhouse gas emissions in the next eight years.

-   [@unitednationsenvironmentprogrammeunepEmissionsGapReport2021] report "If implemented effectively, net-zero emissions pledges could limit warming to 2.2°C, closer to the well-below 2°C goal of the Paris Agreement. However, many national climate plans delay action until after 2030. The reduction of methane emissions from the fossil fuel, waste and agriculture sectors could help close the emissions gap and reduce warming in the short term, the report finds. Carbon markets could also help slash emissions. But that would only happen if rules are clearly defined and target actual reductions in emissions, while being supported by arrangements to track progress and provide transparency."

Voluntary Carbon Markets (VCM) lack standardization and transparency [@elakhodaiWhyVCMNeeds2023].

*Carbon Credits* are useful for private companies who wish to claim *carbon neutrality, climate positivity*, or other related claim, which might be viewed in good light by their clients or allow the companies to adhere to certain legislative requirements.

There are many companies which facilitate buy carbon credits as well as a few organizations focused on carbon credit verification.

### Overconsumption \> Earth's Boundaries

Excessive consumer lifestyle - *overconsumption* - is one of the main drivers of climate change and environmental destruction, with *"2/3 of global GHG emissions are directly and indirectly linked to household consumption, with a global average of about 6 tonnes CO~2~ equivalent per capita"* , according to [@reneechoHowBuyingStuff2020; @ivanovaQuantifyingPotentialClimate2020]. An older study put the number as high as 60% percent [@ivanovaEnvironmentalImpactAssessment2016] while [@ellenmacarthurfoundationmaterialeconomicsCompletingPictureHow2019]'s models 45% show of CO~2~ equivalent emissions come from our shopping; produced by companies to make the products we consume.

With the trend of urbanization, it's not surprising (people living in) cities are responsible for 80% of the emissions [@rosalescarreonUrbanEnergySystems2018]. [@mobergMobilityFoodHousing2019] reports daily human activities emission contribution on average in four European countries (France, Germany, Norway and Sweden).

|                |          |
|----------------|----------|
| Emission Share | Category |
| 21%            | Housing  |
| 30%            | Food     |
| 34%            | Mobility |

Earth's growing population reached 8 Billion people In November 2022 and population projections by predict 8.5B people by 2030 and 9.7B by 2050 [@theeconomictimesClimateChangeEarth2022; @unWorldPopulationProspects2022]. Indeed, making *anything* consumes natural resources, which are limited on planet Earth. [@hassounFoodProcessingCurrent2023] forecasts increase of global food demand by 62% driven by the impact of climate change. Yet, while population growth puts higher pressure on Earth's resources, some researchers propose the effect is higher from wasteful lifestyles than the raw number of people [@cardinaleBiodiversityLossIts2012]. Meanwhile others, such as [@cafaroOverpopulationMajorCause2022], believe *\[o\]verpopulation is a major cause of biodiversity loss and smaller human populations are necessary to preserve what is left."*

While the numbers on overconsumption are clear, the debate on overconsumption is so polarized, it's difficult to have a meaningful discussion of the topic [@ianoleOverconsumptionSocietyLookingglass2013]. Environmental risks from human activities are known as Anthropogenic Threat Complexes (ATCs) [@bowlerMappingHumanPressures2020]*.* As long as humanity is a mono-planetary species, we have to come to terms with the limitations of our home, Earth.

### Plastic Pollution

Overconsumption is also one of the root causes of plastic pollution. [@FORD2022150392] and [@laversFarDistractionPlastic2022] find strong links between climate change and marine plastic pollution *"along with other stressors that threaten the resilience of species and habitats sensitive to both climate change and plastic pollution"*.

Plastic pollution is pervasive around the Earth and is fundamentally linked to climate change, while microplastics are increasingly a real concern [@TIERNAN2022169; @laversFarDistractionPlastic2022]. Several international studies report recent findings of microplastics everywhere in human bodies: the brain, lungs, digestive tissues, bone marrow, penis, testis, seminal fluid (semen), and placenta - causing serious health and reproductive concerns [@mainMicroplasticsAreInfiltrating2024; @guoDiscoveryAnalysisMicroplastics2024; @huMicroplasticPresenceDog2024; @codringtonDetectionMicroplasticsHuman2024; @liPrevalenceImplicationsMicroplastic2024; @montanoRamanMicrospectroscopyEvidence2023; @garciaQuantitationIdentificationMicroplastics2024; @zhuTissueAccumulationMicroplastics2024]

In addition to the enormity of over-reaching CO~2~ emissions, humanity is facing other massive environmental problems. The Stockholm Resilience Centre reports we have already breached 4 out of our 9 *"planetary boundaries":* in addition to climate change, biodiversity loss (Extinctions per Million Species per Year aka E/MSY), land-system change (deforestation, land degradation, etc), and biogeochemical flows (cycles of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, etc); on a positive side, the challenges of fresh water use, ocean acidification and stratospheric ozone depletion are still within planetary limits [@perssonOutsideSafeOperating2022].

In 1948, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) was founded, which in

LULUCF "Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry" can both be a source of greenhouse gas emissions - or a carbon sink (removing CO2 from the atmosphere).

### Earth System Law, Planetary Health, and Social Cost of CO~2~

*Planetary Health*, *Earth System Law, and* Social Cost of Carbon are 3 approaches to address the complex interdependence of humans with our physical environment.

Scientists in cross-disciplinary teams have been working on integrating Earth systems and human society into cohesive frameworks.

Evolving Measurements from Planetary Boundaries to Planetary Health

-   Planetary health [@planetaryhealthalliancePlanetaryHealth2024; @planetaryhealthalliancePlanetaryHealthRoadmap2024]

-   @wardaniBoundariesSpacesKnowledge2023 *"long-term human well-being is dependent on the well-being of the planet, including both biotic and abiotic systems. It recognizes interlinkages across environmental sustainability, public health, and socioeconomic development."*

*Earth System Law* is a framework for addressing interconnected environmental challenges [@dutoitReimaginingInternationalEnvironmental2022].

*Social Cost of Carbon* attempts to measures the compound impact of CO~2e~ emissions on society. Sustainability is filled with complexities. CO~2e~ emissions are complicated by biodiversity loss, child labor, slavery, poverty, chemical pollution, etc. - many issues become intertwined [@tedxSustainableBusinessFrank2020]. One attempt to measure these complexities, is the *Social Cost of Carbon* (SCC) which is defined as *"additional damage caused by an extra unit of emissions"* [@kornekSocialCostCarbon2021; @zhenSimpleEstimateSocial2018]. For example the cost of damages caused by "one extra ton of carbon dioxide emissions" [@stanforduniversityProfessorsExplainSocial2021]. SCC variations exist between countries [@tolSocialCostCarbon2019] and regions [@wangMeasurementChinaProvincial2022].


-   [@linOpportunitiesTackleShortlived2022] says, apart from CO~2~, reduction of other atmospheric pollutants, such as non-CO~2~ greenhouse gases (GHGs) and short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) is required for climate stability.

-   [@wangMultimodelAssessmentClimate2022]: Quantifying climate damage proposes scenarios of climate damage.

## Ecosystem Services: Quantifying Human Benefits from Nature

*Ecosystem services measure the benefits humans receive from the biosphere.* Put most simply, *ecosystem services* enable human life on Earth. While it can be assumed much of the flora and fauna are crucial for Earth's systems, science is still in the process of understanding and quantifying its contributions. The history of the valuation of nature's services goes back to the 18th century when David Ricardo and Jean Baptiste Say discussed nature's *work*, however both considered it should be free [@historyEcosystemServices2010]. In 1997 [@dailyNatureServicesSocietal1997] proposed the idea of *ecosystem services* and [@costanzaValueWorldEcosystem1997] attempted to assess the amount of ecosystem services provided. [@leprovostSupplyMultipleEcosystem2022]'s study shows *biodiversity* as one key factor to maintain delivery of ecosystem services. [@noriegaResearchTrendsEcosystem2018] attempts to quantify the ecosystem services (ES) provided by insects.

The most complex computer models which attempt to capture ever more interactions happening in the physical realm are called *digital twins.* The EU is developing a digital twin of Earth to help sustainability prediction and planning, integrating Earth's various systems such as climate, hydrology, ecology, etc, into a single model [@hoffmannDestinationEarthDigital2023 and @DestinationEarthShaping2023]. We can use all the data being recorded to provide a digital twin of the planet, nature, ecosystems and human actions to help us change our behavior and optimize for planetary wellbeing.

### The Biosphere: Earth's Life Support System

Earth's biosphere is made up of 846 terrestrial ecoregions, which are distributed across 14 major biomes and 8 biogeographical realms [@dinersteinEcoregionBasedApproachProtecting2017].

### Using Ecological Indicators to Track Environmental Health

Sustainability can be measured using a variety of *ecological indicators*.

Ecological indicators for Earth *- I would like to coin the word "ecomarkers" -* are like *biomarkers* in human health.

Technological advances help scientist better understand nature. Cutting edge research uses AI-based voice recognition for listening to nature, assessing biodiversity based on species' sounds in the forest. Millions of detections of different species with machine learning passive acoustic AI models, can also assess species' response to climate change [@aiforgoodListeningNatureHarnessing2023; @guerreroAcousticAnimalIdentification2023].

*Environmental DNA (eDNA)* helps scientists measure species abundance without direct observation through detection of DNA on genetic materials such as skin cells [@peterandreysmitharchivepageHowEnvironmentalDNA2024]. Cellular DNA can be isolated from various sediment types [@ogramExtractionPurificationMicrobial1987]. Beyond scientific applications, eDNa is being used to generate biodiversity credits by environmental asset rating companies such as BeZero [@ojoatreTriallingEDNABiodiversity2023].

AI is being used to map icebergs and measure the change in size [@europeanspaceagencyAIMapsIcebergs2023].

### Biodiversity Loss: Causes, Impacts, and Solutions

Why Protect Biodiversity?

[@mayWhyShouldWe2011] argues biodiversity loss is a concern for 3 points of views:

|  |  |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| View |  |
| Narrowly Utilitarian | Biodiversity is a resource of genetic novelties for the biotech industry. |
| Broadly Utilitarian | Humans depend upon biodiverse ecosystems. |
| Ethical | Humans have a responsibility to future generations to pass down a rich natural world. |

: From [@mayWhyShouldWe2011].

-   Meanwhile the destruction pressure on ecosystems is rapidly increasing (ADD CITATION A B C).

-   @chenResponseEcosystemVulnerability2023 Ecosystem vulnerability **(need access)**

-   @zhangIntegratingEcosystemServices2023 Integrating ecosystem services conservation into urban planning **(need access)**

-   @liDistinguishingImpactTourism2023 tourism is a large industrial sector which relies on ecosystem services. In Taiwan, [@leeDevelopingIndicatorFramework2021] developed a framework of indicators to assess sustainable tourism.

**Measuring Environmental Degradation**

[@livingPlanetReport2022] reported, the number of species killed, mass destruction of nature. "69% decline in the relative abundance of monitored wildlife populations around the world between 1970 and 2018. Latin America shows the greatest regional decline in average population abundance (94%), while freshwater species populations have seen the greatest overall global decline (83%)."

```{python}
biodiversity_chart()
```

Biodiversity loss is linked to overconsumption, weak legislation and lack of oversight. [@crennaBiodiversityImpactsDue2019] recounts European Union consumers' negative impact on biodiversity in countries where it imports food. @wwfForestsReducingEU2022 case study highlights how 4 biodiverse regions Cerrado in Brazil, Chaco in Argentina, Sumatra in Indonesia, and the Cuvette Centrale in Democratic Republic of Congo are experiencing rapid destruction due to consumer demand in the European Union. While the European Union (EU) has recently become a leader in sustainability legislation, biodiversity protection measures among private companies is very low @marco-fondevilaTrendsPrivateSector2023.

Meanwhile, there is some progress in biodiversity conservation as "\[\*b\]iodiversity awareness is now at 72% or higher in all countries sampled, compared to only 29% or higher across countries sampled in 2009"\* [@uebtBiodiversityBarometer2022]

**Convention on Biodiversity**

Similarly to climate protection, the UN has taken a leadership role in biodiversity protection. @unitHistoryConvention2023: The history of the United Nations Convention on Biodiversity goes back to 1988, when the working group was founded. @unepCOP15EndsLandmark2022: The Convention on Biodiversity 2022 (COP15) adopted the first global biodiversity framework to accompany climate goals.

### Oceans and Marine Ecosystem Sustainability

Marine heatwaves are intensifying under climate change, threatening species diversity and the ocean’s capacity to supply critical services from fisheries to carbon sequestration [@smaleMarineHeatwavesThreaten2019]. Accelerating ocean warming, evidenced by record-breaking sea-surface temperatures, has triggered widespread coral bleaching, cleary visible at the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland, East Coast of Australia, loss of marine habitat complexity, and cascading threats to coastal economies and food security; the authors call for integrated climate–ocean policy action, stressing that without urgent emissions cuts and ecosystem-based adaptation, the ocean’s capacity to regulate climate and sustain biodiversity will collapse [@gellesOceanDireMessage2023; @pfeifferCoralGiantsSound2024]. 
Cumulative pressures: climate extremes, pollution, and overexploitation — have driven evolutionary shifts in marine life and unpredictably altered ecosystem-service delivery [@espinosaImpactsEvolutionChanges2023].

Some earlier studies, such as [@howardPotentialIntegrateBlue2017] demonstrate how integrating blue carbon habitats into Marine Protected Area (MPA) design can both mitigate carbon emissions and enhance ecosystem resilience. Meta-analyses across 121 sites in 87 MPAs globally show that most well-designed and managed MPAs achieve significant ecological gains: on average, fish biomass inside no-take zones can double to triple compared with outside areas, and species richness likewise increases by 20–30 % within 5–10 years of enforcement [@ruddPathwaysMarineProtected2015]. However, Marine Protected Areas cover only 8% of the world's oceans and only 2.8% is effectively protected [@iginiJust28Worlds2024]. The UN’s 30x30 target (set under the Convention on Biological Diversity) aims to protect 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030, however is not on track to achieve this goal [@mouterdeBiodiversityWorldNot2024].

### Forests: Carbon Sinks and Biodiversity Reservoirs

Forests are a crucial part of Earth's carbon cycle and the main natural CO~2~ capture system; due to deforestation, Europe rapidly losing its forest carbon sink [@fredericsimonEuropeRapidlyLosing2022]. Around 27% of Earth's land area is still covered by forests yet *deforestation* is widespread all around the world; highest rates of deforestation happened in the tropical rainforests of South America and Africa, mainly caused by agricultural cropland expansion (50% of all deforestation) and grazing land for farm animals to produce meat (38,5%), totaling close to 90% of global deforestation [@FRA2020Remote2022]. The global forest cover change is visible on Google's Earth Engine [@hansenHighResolutionGlobalMaps2013].

Around the world, there are many initiatives to increase forest cover, for example the *1 billion tree project* [@greenfieldVeNeverSaid2021; @ErratumReportGlobal2020; @bastinGlobalTreeRestoration2019]. However, it's important to not planting trees (*afforestation)* is not the full solution, as *afforestation* is different from *reforestation*, which takes into account biodiversity. Also, while using remote-sensing and machine-learning to assess reforestation potential [see @klostermanMappingGlobalPotential2022], it doesn't take into account local political realities.

-   Burning of biomass undermines carbon capture.
-   @bousfieldCarbonPaymentsCan2022 reports there's evidence paying landowners for the ecosystem services their forests provide may reduce deforestation.
-   nature-based solutions.

### Pollution: Air, Water, and Soil Degradation

In, Taiwan this is the ranking of pollution reports by citizens [@ministryofdigitalaffairsZhengFuZiLiaoKaiFangPingTai2024]:

```{python}
taiwan_pollution_reports()
```

```{python}
taiwan_pollution_reports_stacked()
```

Health and sustainability are inextricably linked. "Human health is central to all sustainability efforts.", *"All of these (food, housing, power, and health care), and the stress that the lack of them generate, play a huge role in our health"* [@sarahludwigrauschSustainabilityYourHealth2021].

**Air Pollution**

Clean air is a proposed as a *human right* [@baronessjonesofmoulsecoombCleanAirHuman2023] yet air pollution is widespread around the planet, with 99% of Earth's human population being affected by bad air quality that does not meet WHO air quality guidelines, leading to health problems linked to 6.7 million *premature deaths* every year [@worldhealthorganizationAmbientOutdoorAir2022].

Air pollution is linked to cancer incidence. In Taiwan, South Korea, and England, groundbreaking research by [@lim1MOAirPollutioninduced2022] analyzed over 400000 individuals establishes exposure to 2.5μm PM (PM2.5) air pollution as a *cause for lung cancer.* In [@hannahdevlinCancerBreakthroughWakeup2022], professor Tony Mok, of the Chinese University of Hong Kong explains it plainly, which I want to quote here in verbatim:

> *"We have known about the link between pollution and lung cancer for a long time, and we now have a possible explanation for it. As consumption of fossil fuels goes hand in hand with pollution and carbon emissions, we have a strong mandate for tackling these issues -- for both environmental and health reasons."*

The main way to combat air pollution is through policy interventions. [@marialuisfernandesRealityCheckIndustrial2023] the EU has legislation in progress to curb industrial emissions. If legislation is in place, causing bad air quality can become bad for business. In China, [@guHiddenCostsNongreen2023] links air pollution to credit interest rates for business loans; companies with low environmental awareness and a history of environmental penalties pay 12 percent higher interest rates. In France, [@bouscasseDesigningLocalAir2022] finds strong health and economic benefits across the board from air pollution reduction.

**Water Pollution**

Lack of access to sufficient clean water and water pollution are issues in several places around the world. Globally, 4.4 billion people only have access to water that's not safe for drinking [@solimanUnacceptableStaggeringBillion2024]. Even in wealthy countries like the the US, with incressing situations of water scarcity and draught due to climate change, issues of water ownership become increasingly dire. [@naishadhamDroughtstrickenArizonaFresh2023; @kochOpinionArizonaRace2022] describes a fight in the US over water usage rights in Arizona, where Fondomonte, a subsidiary of a Saudi Arabian company that grows a water-hungry crop alfalfa, exacerbating the local water crisis by using large amounts of public water, leading to public outcry and being sued for "public nuisance" for its excessive groundwater pumping, and finally cessation of its lease and operations on state land; but still continuing operations on private land [@naishadhamArizonaCancelLeases2023; @SaudiFirmThat2023].

Once pollution is in the environment, cleaning it up is very expensive. For instance, in France, where stormwater washed pollution into the waterways feeding into the Seine river, making it unsuitable for swimming, the city of Paris invested 1.4 Billion Euros to create a massive underground reservoir and a water cleaning system by the opening of the Paris Olympics in 2024 - and still the water quality would be variable based on rain incidentce [@waltBillionDollarEffortClean2023].

-   Bioswales help catch storm debris and reduce water pollution.


**Soil Pollution**

In Saudi Arabia, [@picoWildRuderalPlants2023] used wild and ruderal plants as bioindicators to detect pollution of air, water and soil,specifically anthropogenic pollution, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and other industrial chemicals, concluding both Abha and Riyadh showed notable levels of pollutants while Riyadh (a city with more industry) showed higher levels of pollution.

### Disaster Preparedness and Climate Resilience

The Word Economic Forums Global Risks Report 2024 paints a bleak picture of the future with expectations of increased turbulence across the board based on a survey of over 1400 topic experts [@worldeconomicforumGlobalRisksReport].

### Weather Patterns and Climate Extremes

Warming global climate has concrete effects on daily life. Warmer climate helps viruses and fungi spread [@pressFungalDiseaseRapidly2023]. [@williamsIntensificationWinterTransatlantic2013] higher CO2 concentrations in the air can cause more turbulence for flights.

Global warming increases the risk of disasters and extreme weather events. The US Global Change Research Program presented a comprehensive report to the US Congress, which links disaster-risk directly to global warming; for examples increased wildfires damage property, endanger life and reduces *air quality,* which in effect increases health challenges [@FifthNationalClimate2023]. As extreme temperatures are increasingly commonplace, with observed changes in heatwaves, there's increased risk of wildfires [@volkovaEffectsPrescribedFire2021; @perkins-kirkpatrickExtremeHeatClimate2023], while flood risk mapping might lower property prices in at risk areas [@sherrenFloodRiskMapping2024]. Summers of 2022 and 2023 were the hottest on record so far, with extreme heat waves recorded in places around the world [@venturelliHighTemperatureCOVID192023; @serrano-notivoliUnprecedentedWarmthLook2023; @douglasThisSummerTrack2023; @EarthJustHad2023; @NOAAJune2023; @falconer123MillionHeat2023].

The part of Earth where the *human climate niche* is becoming smaller [@mckibbenWhereShouldLive2023]. As temperatures rise, certain cities may become uninhabitable for humans [@cbcradioExtremeHeatCould2021]. The summer of 2023 saw extensive wildfires in Spain, Canada, and elsewhere; rapidly moving fires destroyed the whole city of Lāhainā in Hawaii \[ADD CITATION\]. In California, [@jerrettSmokeCaliforniaGreenhouse2022] says, *"\[w\]ildfires are the second most important source of emissions in 2020"* and *"negate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from other sectors."* Some parts of South America have seen summer heat *in the winter*, with heatwaves with temperatures as high as 38 degrees [@livingstonItMidwinterIt2023].

In Taiwan disaster risk and hazard mapping is well-developed, with early warning systems, and comprehensive response preparedness - and painful experiences - instrumental to saving lives [@tsaiFrameworkEmergencyResponse2021]. Intensifying storms forming near coastlines, can be expected with *"\[c\]hanges to tropical cyclone trajectories in Southeast Asia under a warming climate"* [@garnerChangesTropicalCyclone2024]. The situation on the Pacific and Atlantic oceans is not dissimilar, with *"\[o\]bserved increases in North Atlantic tropical cyclone peak intensification rates"* [@garnerObservedIncreasesNorth2023].

In the Phillipines, with increasing extreme weather events, *"businesses are more likely to emerge in areas where infrastructure is resilient to climate hazards"* [@chengAssessingEconomicLoss2022].

Climate-related disasters can spur action as extreme weather becomes visible to everyone. After large floods in South Korea in July 2023 with many victims, president Joon promised to begin taking global warming seriously and steer the country towards climate action [@webSouthKoreaPresident2023; @afpKoreaPresidentVows2023; @aljazeeraDeathTollKorea2023]. South Korea has a partnership with the European Union [@europeancommissionEURepublicKorea2023].

## Financialization of Nature vs Nature's Sacred Value: Scaling Up Sustainable Action

There are 2 main approaches to protecting nature:

|  |  |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Economics of Nature Commodification** | **Economics of the Sacred** |
| Measure and assign monetary value to nature. | Nature is Sacred - such as are religious holy places - and can't be touched [@eisensteinSacredEconomicsMoney2011; @eisensteinClimateNewStory2018] |

-   [@MonetaryValuationNature2023] asks should we put a price on nature?
-   Is it time to leave utilitarian environmentalism behind? @muradianEcosystemServicesNature2021

| Commodify nature                               |

: From [@MonetaryValuationNature2023].

### Ecological Restoration: Healing Damaged Ecosystems Through Agroforestry & Permaculture

Some argue sustainability is not enough and we should work on *regeneration* of natural habitat. The UN announced 2021-2030 the Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, which includes a wide range of regenerative action [@fischerMakingDecadeEcosystem2021]. For instance, [@hanEmbeddingNaturebasedSolutions2022] identifies nature-based solutions "land re-naturalization (such as afforestation and wetland restoration)"

| Non-Exhaustive list of Regenerative Actions |
|------------------------|
| Afforestation          |
| Wetland restoration    |

The organic food and drink market is growing worldwide, with gross sales in 2019 totalling over 106 billion euros, albeid being a small percentage of total food industry [@gamageRoleOrganicFarming2023]. Growing organic food poses many challenges, which farmers need to adapt to, in order to participate in regenerative food systems. One approach is growing food forests, also known as agroforestry, which integrates farming into natural environments, achieving CO2 storage in the soil through agriculture and forestry using agroecological practices.

In Ireland, [@irwinIncreasingTreeCover2023] studied dairy farmers' willingness to plant trees to increase vegetation cover on their land, finding that economic incentives alone are insufficient, and support in the form of advisory and education is needed. Similarly, in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest [@yadavExploringInnovationSustainable2023] finds the active participation of the local community in planning permaculture practices, enhances their acceptance and effectiveness. In Bangladesh, [@rubaPotentialityHomesteadAgroforestry2023] found agroforestry plays an active role in achieving the country's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including zero hunger, climate action, mitigating climate change impacts through CO2 sequestration, life on land through biodiversity conservation and improving soil fertility, yet is hindered by the lack of policy support and educational level of the farmers. In the Baltic Sea region in North-Eastern Europe and Central Europe face similar challenges, [@balticseaactiongroupEITFoodRegenerative2023] pointing out farmers' traditional mindset as the biggest obstacle, describing the paradigm shift from extractive farming to regenerative agriculture, using techniques such as no-till farming, which reduces soil erosion and improve soil health by reducing synhetic imputs; yet, it's not only a single practice that is enough, regenerative agriculture is a holistic approach and agroecology education programmes need to be comprehehnsive.

[@lowMixedFarmingAgroforestry2023] futher studies how agroforestry deep integration into food value chains unlocks opportunties for recognition and rewards from economic actors in the network, underlining how complex and knowledge-heavy nature of value-capture, calling for further standardisation of practices to reward sustainability practices and ecosystem services. The challenge lies in that bioeconomy is not inherently sustainable and may put biodiversity at risk, depending on the level of industrialisation of agriculture and specific practices, which require deep knowledge and understanding of natural and artifical interactions the ecological systems; the authors advocate for a precise distinction between extractive and regenerative practices in "bioeconomy" [@ollinahoSeparatingTwoFaces2023]. Finally, taking Brazil as and example, [@dequeiroz-steinPossibilitiesMainstreamingBiodiversity2023] argues for an integration of competing and comflicting bioeconomy policies, in order to achieve the goals of a sustainable bioeconomy.

Svalbard Seed Vault is an example of seed conservation to safeguard biodiversity by storing backup seeds of plants from around the world in cold storage [@westengenGlobalExSituCrop2013; @asdalSvalbardGlobalSeed2018]. Since its opening in 2008, the storage solution provided by the Norwegian government has stored seeds from from 123 genebanks in 85 countries around the world [@newSeedSamples2025; @ArcticDoomsdaySeed2025]. [@vitalettiShareTinySpace2025] proposes using a blockchain-based lottery system to storage seeds in local refridgerators, in order to enhance resliance and ensure survivial of seeds, by storing seeds in many locations.

## Energy Production

Geopolitical situations can affect technology adoption; after Russia's war in Ukraine, Europe needed to quickly reduce consuming cheap Russian fossil fuel energy (in the form of gas) [@bonasiaWindSolarEnergy2024]. In 2024, for first time in Europe, renewables in the form of wind and solar energy surged past production of fossil fuels [@grahamWindSolarOvertake2024; @beerWindSolarOvertake2024].

EU's energy mix in 2024

```{python}

Globally, renewables also overtook fossil fuels [@ieaElectricityMidYearUpdate2024].

"Climatech", Renewable Energy and Transforming Energy Production

Large technology conglomerates and newly founded startups working in climate solutions space (often referred to as *climatech* by the media) have proposed a range of approaches to CO~2~ reduction in Earth's atmosphere. These technologies include several types of *carbon capture*, directly from the air (direct air capture or DAC), from the source of pollution, such as using high–performance filters on factory chimneys, as well as nature-based solutions such as large scale tree planting using drones.

Each technology has their own pros and cons. [@vitilloRoleCarbonCapture2022] illustrates how direct air capture of CO~2~ is difficult because of low concentration and CO~2~ capture at the source of the emissions is more feasible.

@lowRethinkingNetZeroSystems2022 considering pathways to drawdown finds considerable uncertainty exists among experts which CO2 reduction methods among nature-based and technology-based are the most effective.

-   [@gaureTrueNotTrue2022] simulate a CO~2~ free electricity generation system in the European Union where "98% of total electricity production is generated by wind power and solar; the remainder is covered by a backup technology.". The authors stipulate it's possible to power the EU without producing CO~2~ emissions.

## Navigating Complexity with Data: Towards Probabilistic Risk-Based Assessment in Sustainability

Sustainability is a complex web of interconnections.

-   thread of commodification of nature. category mistake. impossible to bring back already destroyed biodiversity which took millennia to develop. humans create hugely complex systems instead of simply conserving nature.

-   The concept of how a public resource is over-used until breaking down as each user only bears a fraction of the cost - know as *tragedy of the commons* -was described by the ecologist Garrett Hardin in 1968 [@hardinTragedyCommonsPopulation1968; @meisingerTragedyIntangibleCommons2022; @lopezClimateChangeTimes2022; @muraseSevenRulesAvoid2018].

### Individual Action

Sometimes individual environmental (climate) action *does matter* and can come at great personal cost, even loss of life. EJAtlas tracks environmental justice cases around the world, where human stakes are very high [see coverage by @martinez-alierMappingEcologicalDistribution2021 and @martinez-alierReplyOrihuelaExtractivism2022 as well as @scheidelEnvironmentalConflictsDefenders2020].

However, for most of us individual climate action is *ineffective*. The effect of individual climate action such as *choosing a more sustainable product* is so limited to be next to meaningless. For individual consumer choices to make a difference, they need to be *aggregated* into a movement, collective action with scale, influence, and visibility.

There is no single solution to the environmental crisis. Given the enormity of environmental degradation, many different approaches are needed. This chapter documents some of the ongoing work which a sustainability companion could assist college students get involved with.
