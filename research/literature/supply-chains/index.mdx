## Realtime ESG
https://ctmfile.com/story/real-time-esg-data-on-supply-chains-a-breakthrough
“supply chain is a significant source of ESG content”
“Real-time ESG data is more difficult to greenwash”

“factory social score”.

People working at the factories can report conditions

“But the real breakthrough is how we can surface that real-time ESG data directly to individuals in the shops and online, linked to the products that they are browsing and potentially buying. This means that ESG change will finally be driven by the ultimate judge of business success – the customer.”

“thanks to other emerging technology like IoT sensors (to collect ESG data) and blockchain (to track transactions), we have the infrastructure to collect more data, particularly for machine consumption. By measuring real-time energy usage, transportation routes, manufacturing waste, and so forth, we have more quantifiable ways to track corporations’ environmental performance without relying purely on what they say.”
