## Literature Review

### Goals

Given the goal of designing an app to integrate sustainable shopping,
saving, and investing. The goal of the literature review is to find
insights about the target audience (Taiwanese college students),
understand what kind of sustainable actions are effective, and translate
these into specific ideas for app features. In order to keep track more
easily, each literature review chapter provides *design implications*
which are shown in the results section.

The literature review branches out to 5 main directions and maps out
relationships sources and the literature map, namely Taiwanese college
students, generation-z demographics, sustainability, ecology, ecosystem
services, EU legislation, sustainable finance, sustainable investing,
savings, circular economy, economics, AI, existing sustainability,
software, sustainability–related mobile apps (Apple iOS / Google
Android), and web apps related to sustainable shopping, savings, and
investing; apps using algorithmic interfaces (AI-based UI), design,
UX/UI, service design, sustainable design, speculative design,
interaction design, behavior change, nudge.

### Sources

There is currently no single platform that hosts all scientific journals
leading me to source scientific papers from

-   ScienceDirect
-   Nature
-   the Lancet
-   Oxford Academic
-   Semantic Scholar
-   JSTor
-   Google search.

### AI Usage in Research

I’m a long time AI-assistant user. AI was used for

-   search
-   data comparison
-   data science
-   chart-building
-   translation
-   feedback

AI was *NOT* used for writing.
