# Literature Review

The literature review branches out to 5 main directions and maps out
relationships sources and the literature map, namely Taiwanese college
students, generation-z demographics, sustainability, ecology, ecosystem
services, EU legislation, sustainable finance, sustainable investing,
savings, circular economy, economics, AI, existing sustainability,
software, sustainability–related mobile apps (Apple iOS / Google
Android), and web apps related to sustainable shopping, savings, and
investing; apps using algorithmic interfaces (AI-based UI), design,
UX/UI, service design, sustainable design, speculative design,
interaction design, behavior change, nudge.

The following chart shows a tiny portion of the papers considered in
this research at the first stage of proposing this research.

The 2nd chart illustrated how the literature review quickly grew they
more I read and understood what I don’t understand - thus needing to
read more. This is still a small subset of the literature that was
reviewer. However, it does give a better silhouette of the shape of the
entire literature review.

Finally, this is a more complete concept map of the topics relevant to
my research that largely emerged from the literature.

### Goals

Given the ambition of designing an app to integrate sustainable
shopping, saving, and investing, the goal of the literature review is to
find insights about the target audience (Taiwanese college students),
understand what kind of sustainable actions are effective, and translate
these into specific ideas for app features. In order to keep track more
easily, each literature review chapter provides *design implications*
which are shown in the results section.

### Sources

There is currently no single platform that hosts all scientific journals
leading me to source scientific papers from

1.  ScienceDirect
2.  Nature
3.  The Lancet
4.  Oxford Academic
5.  Semantic Scholar
6.  JSTOR
7.  Google search.

### AI Use

Statement of AI Usage in Research: I’m a long time AI-assistant user.

AI was used for:

1.  Search
2.  Data comparison
3.  Data science
4.  Chart-building
5.  Translation
6.  Feedback
7.  Editing
8.  Spell-checking
9.  Proofreading
10. Ranking citations’ relevance to existing body of writing

AI was *NOT* used for writing.

A visualization of incremental changes (over a thousand Git commits) to
the thesis can be seen on the GitHub repository as well as in the
