“Like climate change, the focus on individual actions as a solution is
often misplaced, though it remains a focus of media and industry. For
decades, the petrochemical industry has offloaded responsibility onto
individuals through promoting concepts such as the “carbon footprint”,
championed in a 2004 advertising campaign by British Petroleum
(Cherry and Sneirson, 2011). “

“The global food sovereignty movement, which had been building momentum since its grassroots conception in the late ’90s, quickly gained traction with its focus on the rights of people everywhere to access healthy and sustainable food. One of the pillars of the movement lies in using local food systems to reduce the distance between producers and consumers.”

“We can grow foods just as well in the inner city as we can out in the country because we’re agnostic to arable land,” says Woods. “Because we grow indoors and create our own weather, [climate change] doesn’t affect our produce.”
