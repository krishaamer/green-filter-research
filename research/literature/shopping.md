### Food Sustainability {#food-sustainability}

Saner et al. (2015) reports dairy (46%) and meat and fish (29%) products making up the largest GHG emission potential.

Röös et al. (2023) identified 5 perspectives in a small study (*n=106*) of views on the Swedish food system:

1.  *“The diagnostic perspective: All hands on deck to fix the climate”*
2.  *“The regenerative perspective: Diversity, soil health and organic agriculture to the rescue”*
3.  *“The fossil-free perspective: Profitable Swedish companies to rid agriculture and the food chain of fossil fuel”*
4.  *“The consumer-driven perspective: A wish-list of healthy, high-quality and climate-friendly foods”*
5.  \_ “The hands-on perspective: Tangible solutions within the reach of consumers and the food industry”\_

### Food Sovereignty {#food-sovereignty}

“The global food sovereignty movement, which had been building momentum since its grassroots conception in the late ’90s, quickly gained traction with its focus on the rights of people everywhere to access healthy and sustainable food. One of the pillars of the movement lies in using local food systems to reduce the distance between producers and consumers.”

“We can grow foods just as well in the inner city as we can out in the country because we’re agnostic to arable land,” says Woods. “Because we grow indoors and create our own weather, \[climate change\] doesn’t affect our produce.” https://canadiangeographic.ca/articles/fresh-from-the-city-the-rise-of-urban-farming/

## Sustainable Fashion and Textile Design {#sustainable-fashion-and-textile-design}

European Environment Agency (EEA) estimates based on trade and production data that EU27 citizens consumed an average 15kg of textile products per person per year (European Environment Agency (2022)). Globally 87% of textile products are burned or landfilled after 1st consumer use (Köhler et al. (2021)). In Europe, there’s large variance between member states when in comes to textile recycling: while Estonia and France are the only EU countries where separate collection of textiles is required by law, in Estonia 100% of the textiles were burned in an incinerator in 2018 while in France textiles are covered by an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme leading to higher recovery rates (Ibid).

Nonetheless, EPR schemes do not guarantee circularity and may instead be designed around fees to finance waste management in linear economy models (Christiansen et al. (2021)). French EPR scheme was upgraded in 2020 to become more circular (Jacques Vernier (2021)). In any case, strong consumer legislation (such as EPR) has a direct influence on producers’ actions. For example, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council notified textile producers in July 2022 reminding factories to produce to French standards in order to be able enter the EU market: (HKTDC Research (2022)).

### Carbon Labelling {#carbon-labelling}

Adding CO2 labels for consumer products have been discussed for decades (Adam Corner (2012)). While academic literature has looked at even minute detail such as color and positioning of the label (Zhou et al. (2019)) and there is some indication consumers are willing to pay a small premium for low-CO2 products (Xu & Lin (2022)) as well as all else being equal, choose the option with a lower CO2 number (Carlsson et al. (2022)), the idea of *Carbon Labelling* is yet to find mainstream adoption.

Although there’s some evidence to suggest labeling low CO2 food enables people to choose a *climatarian diet* in a large-scale study of UK university students, their impact on the market share of low-carbon meals is negible (Lohmann et al. (2022)). Asioli et al. (2022) found differences between countries, where Spanish and British consumers chose meat products with *‘No antibiotics ever’* over a *Carbon Trust* label, whereas French consumers chose CO2 labeled meat products. Labels alone are not enough, as underlined by Edenbrandt & Lagerkvist (2022) in Sweden in a study which found a negative correlation between worrying about climate impact and interest in climate information on products, suggesting a need for wider environmental education programmes.

— Current shopping is like having a one-night stand. you barely know the name of your company. You don’t know much about their background. Building consumer feeeling of ownership, create meaningful connections between producers and consumers.

— “Around two-thirds of global GHG emissions are directly and indirectly linked to household consumption, with a global average of about 6 tCO2eq/cap.

### Realtime ESG {#realtime-esg}

There’s a growing number of companies helping businesses to measure CO2e emissions in their product lifecycle.

-   Makersite, instant sustainability impact from supply chain (Kyle Wiggers (2022))

-   Product sustainability modeling (Makersite (n.d.))

-   “Real-time ESG data is more difficult to greenwash”, “supply chain is a significant source of ESG content” (Tim Nicolle (n.d.))

-   Automate CO2 calculations realtime:

-   FlowIT https://www.ituudised.ee/uudised/2022/09/22/eesti-it-firma-automatiseeris-flowiti-ja-pwc-toel-susiniku-jalajalje-kaardistamise-saast-90

-   “Factory social score”.

-   People working at the factories can report conditions

-   “But the real breakthrough is how we can surface that real-time ESG data directly to individuals in the shops and online, linked to the products that they are browsing and potentially buying. This means that ESG change will finally be driven by the ultimate judge of business success – the customer.” https://www.esganalytics.io/
