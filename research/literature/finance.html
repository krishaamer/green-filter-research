<section id="sustainable-capital-allocation-methods" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sustainable-capital-allocation-methods">Sustainable Capital Allocation Methods</h3>
<p>Fintech (financial technologies) holds the potential to drive consumers on a pathway towards ESG (Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance) investing. The extent to which this funnel works - and it’s indeed a complex, multi–step funnel - depends on curbing greenwashing to a level that allows consumers to distinguish eco–friendly businesses from the heavy polluters - and delivering a simple UX (user experience).</p>
<p>This chapter explores the larger trend of <em>Democratization of Financial Markets</em> through consumer-facing applications that enable new user interactions which increasingly blur boundaries between shopping, saving, and investing (SSI). The efforts to boost user numbers have driven apps that started out with only payments-focused businesses - such as Revolut and N26 - branch out into offering savings accounts and investing options. Regardless of if it’s money spent on shopping or money saved and invested, these are all financial decisions of <em>capital allocation</em>, and in one way or another, we’re giving our money to companies for continued economic growth. The critical question is: do we choose to support sustainability-focused companies that invest deeply into green innovation and eco-friendly practices - or those that pay less attention to sustainability?</p>
<p>Consumers are beginning to become more money-savvy yet are still missing many key concepts from financial literacy. Giving users exposure to investment opportunities through familiar activities like shopping may have the potential to boost financial literacy levels and entice consumers to learn more about taking advantage of their opportunities financial markets - as well as how to manage the types or risk involved.</p>
<p>Shopping, saving, and investing are converging on digital platforms (superapps) that permeate our daily financial lives, with features such basic banking, payments, transfers, as well as reward and cashback programs (Rakuten), round-up to next dollar with automated micro-investing (e.g.&nbsp;Acorn, Stash, Swedbank), and retail investing (Robinhood, Public) and copy-trading (eToro) into various (fractional shares of) stocks, derivatives like CFDs and futures, microloans (Kiva), commodities and precious metals such as gold and silver (Revolut), physical assets such as real estate, land, forest and digital assets such as cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and other alternative assets.</p>
<p>Money is becoming more diverse and the meaning of money itself is changing. We have the fiat money created by governments by law, using central banks, which loan money to commercial banks. And we also have new types of money created by companies and individuals using cryptographic blockchain-based distributed databases, which keep track of transactions (who-paid-whom). Whatever the method of creation, in essence, money is a <em>system of trust</em> where <em>something</em> is used as a <em>medium of value exchange</em> and accepted by <em>other people</em> as payment. Digital money in it’s various forms connects industries on the same apps, which make investing more accessible and socially engaging, appealing to younger people who are active in social media and online shopping.</p>
<p>Trend of sustainably, how can sustainability become more accessible? People want to shop, save, and invest sustainably - how to do it?</p>

<section id="legislation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="legislation">Legislation</h3>
<p>Legislation is Catching Up With Fintechs. Legislation sets higher standards.</p>
<p>Directive 14 2014/65/EU, 2014: The European Union fully recognizes the changing financial landscape trending towards the democratization of investments: <em>“more investors have become active in the financial markets and are offered an even more complex wide-ranging set of services and instruments”</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="europeanparliamentDirective2014652014">(European Parliament, 2014)</span>. Some key legislation for investors has been put in place recently, for example “MiFID II is a legislative framework instituted by the European Union (EU) to regulate financial markets in the bloc and improve protections for investors” <span class="citation" data-cites="kentonMiFIDII2020">(Kenton, 2020)</span>. MiFID II and MiFIR will ensure fairer, safer and more efficient markets and facilitate greater transparency for all participants” <span class="citation" data-cites="europeansecuritiesandmarketsauthorityMiFIDII2017">(European Securities and Markets Authority, 2017)</span>.</p>
<p>Already in 2001, while still part of the EU, the UK government was discussing ways to promote sustainable investment <em>“fundamental changes in VAT or corporation taxes could be used to promote greener consumption and investment”</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="houseofcommonsEnvironmentalAuditSecond2002">(House of Commons, 2002)</span>. More recently, <span class="citation" data-cites="hmtreasuryChancellorSetsOut2020">(HM Treasury, 2020)</span> released a taxonomy of sustainable activities in the UK.</p>
<p>Campain to ban polluting products campaign success story, EU shops can’t sell deforestation products gathered over 100 thousand online signatures <span class="citation" data-cites="EUBanForestkilling2022">(Anon, 2022c)</span>. Legislation banning products contributing to deforestation was passed by the EU Parliament and Council in 2023 and came into effect in July 2024 <span class="citation" data-cites="europeanparliamentRegulationEU20232023 abnettUnitedStatesAsks2024">(European Parliament, 2023; Abnett &amp; Abnett, 2024)</span></p>
<p>While the above trend is for governments to adapt to and work towards their environmental climate commitments and public demand, the sovereign risk remains an issue. For example, in the U.S. the policies supported by President Donald Trump during his presidency ran counter to many sustainability recommendations, including those directed at the financial markets, helping legacy industries stay competitive for longer through subsidies, and lack of regulation, or even regulation supporting legacy technologies <span class="citation" data-cites="quinsonTrumpPlanBlock2020">(Quinson, 2020)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="pwc2022GrowthOpportunity2020">(PWC, 2020)</span> Changes to laws and regulations aimed at achieving climate change mitigation is a key driver behind the wave of ESG adoption. The goal of these laws, first adopted in the European Union, a self-proclaimed leader in eco-friendliness, is to pressure unsustainable companies to change towards greener practices, in fear of losing their access to future capital, and to create a mechanism forcing entire environmentally non-compliant business sectors to innovate towards sustainability unless they want to suffer from financial penalties. On the flip side of this stick and carrot fiscal strategy, ESG-compliant companies will have incentives to access to cheaper capital and larger investor demand from ESG-friendly investors.</p>

<section id="payments" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="payments">Payments</h4>
<p>Banks and Fintechs Capture User Data. Payments are an Entry Point and Source of Consumer Action Data, Shopping Data. Payments is the primary way consumers use money. Is there a funnel From Payments to Investing? ESG Shopping is about Changing our relationship with money. Make commerce more transparent. Current shopping is like having a one-night stand. you barely know the name of your company. You don’t know much about their background. Building consumer feeling of ownership, create meaningful connections between producers and consumers.</p>
<p>Payments is one way consumers can take individual climate action. In the words of a Canadian investment blogger, <em>“every dollar you spend or invest is a vote for the companies and their ethical and sustainability practices”</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="fotheringhamHowCreateGreener2017">(Fotheringham, 2017)</span>. The combination of consumption and investment is an access point to get the consumer thinking about investing. Even if the amount are small, they are a starting point for a thought process.</p>
<p>Digitalisation of payments creates lots of Point of Sale (PoS) data that’s valuable to understand what people buy. Banks have access to each person’s financial habits which makes it possible to model sustainable behavior using big data analysis. Asian markets have shown the fastest growth in the use of digital payments <span class="citation" data-cites="mckinseyNextFrontierAsia2020">(McKinsey, 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>In Taiwan, O Bank makes use of Mastercard’s data to calculate each transaction’s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and offer Taiwanese clients “Consumer Spending Carbon Calculator” and “Low-Carbon Lifestyle Debit Card” products <span class="citation" data-cites="TaiwanOBankLaunches2022">(Anon, 2022e)</span>. Mastercard has developed a service that banks can offer consumers sustainability reports <span class="citation" data-cites="mastercardMastercardUnveilsNew2021">(Mastercard, 2021)</span>. Similarly, Commons, formerly known as Joro, an independent app, analyses your personal financial data to estimate your CO<sub>2</sub> footprint <span class="citation" data-cites="chantPersonalCarboncuttingApp2022">(Chant, 2022)</span>.</p>
<p>A Dutch fintech company Bunq offers payment cards for sustainability, provided by MasterCard, which connects everyday payments to green projects, such as planting trees and donations to charities within the same user interface <span class="citation" data-cites="bunqBunq2020">(Bunq, 2020)</span>. At the same time this can be considered greenwashing as Bunq only plants 1 tree per every €1,000 spend with a Bunq card. The example marketed at students cites <em>8 trees planted this month</em> while students scarcely would have €8,000 to spend every month.</p>
<p>Sharing a similar goal to Alibaba’s Ant Forest, Bunq’s approach creates a new interaction dynamic in a familiar context (card payments), enabling customers to effortlessly contribute to sustainability. However, it lacks the level of gamification which makes Alibaba’s offering so addictive, while also not differentiating between the types of purchases the consumer makes, in terms of the level of eco-friendliness.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, <span class="citation" data-cites="emeleonuNigeriaCapsATM2022">(Emele Onu &amp; Anthony Osae-Brown, 2022)</span> reports how in order to promote the eNaira digital currency use, the Nigerian government limited the amount of cash that can be withdrawn from ATMs <em>“In Nigeria’s largely informal economy, cash outside banks represents 85% of currency in circulation and almost 40 million adults are without a bank account.”</em> <strong>[E-Naira find papers]</strong></p>
<p>In Kenya, M-Pesa started since 2007 for mobile payments, used by more than 80% of farmers <span class="citation" data-cites="tyceNeoliberalstatistDivideDrivers2020 parlascaUseMobileFinancial2022">(Tyce, 2020; Parlasca, Johnen &amp; Qaim, 2022)</span>. Using digital payments instead of cash enables a new class of experiences, in terms of personalization, and potentially, for sustainability.</p>
<p>In Sweden, point of sales (PoS) lending is a common practice, and one of the reasons for the success of Klarna, the Swedish banking startup, which has managed to lend money to more consumers than ever, through this improved user experience. Taking out loans for consumption is a questionable personal financial strategy at best. If people can loan money at the point of sales, why couldn’t there be 180 degrees opposite service - point of sales investing? And there is, called “round-up apps”. <span class="citation" data-cites="AcornsTargetsMillennials">Next Generation Customer Experience (n.d.)</span> suggests “Targeted at millennials, Acorns is the investing app that rounds up purchases to the nearest dollar and invests the difference.” - and example of From Shopping to Investing.</p>
<p>Many banks have started offering a service to automatically save and invest tiny amounts of money collected from shopping expenses. Every purchase one makes contributes a small percentage - usually rounded up to the nearest whole number - to one’s investment accounts. For example, <span class="citation" data-cites="swedbankEasySaver2022">Swedbank (2022)</span>, the leading bank in the Estonian market, offers a savings service where everyday payments made with one’s debit card are rounded up to the next Euro, and this amount is transferred to a separate savings account. Similarly, the Estonian bank <span class="citation" data-cites="lhvMicroinvestmentGrowthAccount2020">LHV (2020)</span> offers micro-investing and micro-savings services, with an interesting user experience innovation showing how for an average Estonian means additional savings of about 400€ per year.</p>

</ul>
<p>While the financial industry is highly digitized, plenty of banks are still paper-oriented, running digital and offline processes simultaneously, making them slower and less competitive, than startups. Indeed, the new baseline for customer-facing finance is set by fintech, taking cues from the successful mobile apps in a variety of sectors, foregoing physical offices, and focusing on offering the best possible online experience for a specific financial service, such as payments.</p>
<p>Banks and Fintech are becoming more similar than ever. 39% of Millenials are willing to leave their bank for a better fintech (n=4,282); innovation in payments helps retention <span class="citation" data-cites="pymntsStayingAheadPayments2023">(PYMNTS, 2023)</span>. The European Central Bank describes fintech as improving the user experience across the board, making interactions more convenient, user-friendly, cheaper, and faster. “Fintech has had a more pronounced impact in the payments market […] where the incumbents have accumulated the most glaring shortcomings, often resulting in inefficient and overpriced products,” Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB says in <span class="citation" data-cites="europeancentralbankLendingPaymentSystems2019">European Central Bank (2019)</span>.</p>
<p>There are also people who are concerned with digital payments. There are concerns digital currencies also help to <em>“democratize financial surveillance”.</em> China was a money innovator introducing paper money in the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD) <span class="citation" data-cites="FirstPaperMoney">(Anon, n.d.h)</span>. <span class="citation" data-cites="jeffbensonChinaReleasesDigital2022">Jeff Benson (2022)</span> “use the e-CNY network to increase financial surveillance.” <span class="citation" data-cites="CentralBankDigital2023">Anon (2023b)</span> Digital currencies make tracking easier. <span class="citation" data-cites="yahoofinanceChallengesFacingChina2022">Yahoo Finance (2022)</span>: WeChat, Alipay, vs digital yuan by Eswar Prasad. <span class="citation" data-cites="ContactlessPaymentsPrevalent2023">Anon (2023c)</span> in Macau Contactless Payments are prevalent.</p>
<p>There are many <em>neobanks</em>, or challenger banks, far too many to list. The table only includes a small sample of banks and the landscape is even larger if one includes the wider array of fintechs. Neo-banks often use sustainability marketing.</p>

<p>There are two ways to look at sustainable saving. This section is going to look at savings in the financial sense of the word. Savings in the sense of CO2e emission and environmental cost reductions have an entire separate chapter dedicated to them titled ‘<em>sustainability</em>’ however a short definition might be valuable here as well.</p>

<p>Saving precedes investing. From building loyalty to building ownership, the first step towards investing is to start saving money. How to encourage savings in daily life and make it a part of the everyday payments experience? Even starting with a small step, gathering a small target amount per month for savings, has the potential to shift the user’s way of thinking about money. The second step, choosing where to invest these savings, will help us begin thinking like an investor. To start noticing trends and looking into how finance shapes the world.</p>

Large consumer brands like Starbucks have for long ran successful rewards programs that encourage customers to come back <span class="citation" data-cites="steinhoffLoyaltyProgramsTravel2021">(Steinhoff &amp; Zondag, 2021)</span>. Could loyalty schemes create a pathway to investing in the company to a strengthen the feeling of connection with the business even further? After all, I’m now a minority owner!

<li>Savings in CO<sub>2</sub> Equivalent Emissions: CO<sub>2</sub> savings are the amount of CO2e reduction one manages to achieve by changing one’s behavior and influencing others (people, companies). While the individual footprint is so small, the largest reduction will come from influencing large groups of people, either by leadership, role-model, or other means. Pension funds are some of the largest asset holders and choosing where to invest one’s pension can be a sustainable financial action. College students might not have a pension fund yet.</li>

<p>Young investors are typically <em>retail investors</em> investing small amounts of money for themselves. (Unless they have inherited wealth or are among the very few who work in an institution such as an investment firm, university endowment, pension fund or mutual fund, and have a say in where to invest large amounts of other peoples’ money.)</p>
<p>Retail investors face many challenges in comparison with their institutional counterparts. For instance, they may have much less time to do proper research, face information asymmetries, where finding good information is limited by time, ability, as well as financial literacy, whereas professional investors have the tools, skills, time, and knowledge, to make better investment decisions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>For young people, investing mostly means buying cryptocurrencies?</em></p></li>
<li><p>Copy-investing is a popular feature of retail investing platforms like EToro</p></li>
<li><p>Investing is a fundamentally hopeful act. It means I think there’s a future. Specifically, ‘green investing’ is investing in the future of our planet - but can we trust the sustainability practices the ‘green’ investment vehicles aggregate, promising to have a positive impact? For example, the European Union for many years counted biomass as ‘green’ energy, even while forestry companies were cutting down trees to produce the biomass - the regulation was not specific enough to curb this practice. So, in effect, a ‘green investor’ might be supporting deforestation. How can an easy-to-use investment app address such complexities without alienating the users?</p></li>

<p>Retail investing also heavily influenced by social media influencers.</p>
<p>Retail investing apps blend entertainment into the UX/UI of investing. For example Robinhood uses game-like features such as displaying a confetti animation to create a sense of excitement around trading investing. Retail investing UI/UX is simplified and gamified, which encourage impulsive short-term buying and selling with a focus on speculation over fundamentals and cause FOMO (fear of missing out).</p>
<p><em>Meme stocks</em> are another aspect of the <em>entertainmenization</em> of investing. There are many groups of Twitter, Reddit, and elsewhere, where investing trends start, causing more volatility.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bonds">Bonds</h4>
<p>Bonds are a form of debt investment also known as an fixed-income asset where the principal is repaid at the maturation date of the bond (usually in years) with an added premium. Individuals can’t emit bonds but they can invest in them. It can be a way to invest locally in one’s own city - or globally. For individuals, there’s access to some green bond exposure through ETFs (exchange-traded funds) available on retail investing apps.</p>
<p>Access is not universal and availability depends on the geography of the user and local legislation; for example Revolut, the most downloaded finance app in the EU, only enabled bond investing for European customers in summer 2024 <span class="citation" data-cites="revolutRevolutUnlocksBonds2024 revolutOur2023Annual2024">(Revolut, 2024b, 2024a)</span>. Investing in bonds is a form of <em>Passive Investing</em> and allows investors focus on low-risk passive income instead of daily stock investing most popular on Robinhood and Revolut - albeit with much less potential for returns.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="green-bonds">Green Bonds</h4>
<p><em>Green bonds</em> are released by companies, international organizations, and cities to raise money for green transformation, usually for building something to improve sustainability, tied to specific projects. There’s a growing global trend in green bond emission, with 257 Billion USD worth of green bonds issued in 2019, expected to reach 1 Trillion USD annually by 2030 <span class="citation" data-cites="macaskillThereGreenPremium2021">(MacAskill et al., 2021)</span>. That prediction was too low with 870 Billion USD green bond emissions reached already in 2023; currently Europe is the largest emitter of green bonds <span class="citation" data-cites="climatebondsClimateBondsInteractive2023">(Climate Bonds, 2023)</span>. China has the 2nd largest green bond market in the world and it’s growing fast; buyers are looking for green bond certification to reduce yield spread, meaning the price of the green bond is becoming more similar to the price of a ‘regular’ bond <span class="citation" data-cites="pengManagingFinancingCosts2022 liWhereGreenBond2022">(Peng &amp; Xiong, 2022; Li, Zhang &amp; Wang, 2022)</span>.</p>
<p>In 2017 the Malmö city in Sweden released green bonds to finance a sustainable transition of the city <span class="citation" data-cites="cityofmalmoGreenBondFramework2017">(City of Malmö, 2017)</span>. An independent analysis found bonds may not be emitted for financial reasons but to improve the reputation and city image, lower interest rate (aptly named <em>greenium</em>) with a similar in returns to traditional bonds - and have their share of challenges, namely being difficult to certify, monitor, report and measure impact of <span class="citation" data-cites="sjostromFinancingSustainableCity2020">(Sjöström et al., 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>Making sure a green bond is truly supporting sustainability is a challenge. For example, Aramco, the Saudi Arabian public petroleum and natural gas company faced scrutiny for what critics deemed as ‘Fake green bonds’ <span class="citation" data-cites="anthropocenefixedincomeinstituteafiiAFIIAramcoReplacement2022">(Anthropocene Fixed Income Institute (AFII), 2022)</span>. Green bonds can also be emitted on blockchains with the stated goal of improving transparency. Hong Kong multi-currency green bond on the blockchain. The issuer (Hong Kong government) hopes to reduce greenwashing <span class="citation" data-cites="hallHKBreaksNew2024 kitanoHongKongHarnesses2024">(Hall, 2024; Kitano, 2024)</span>. In the EU as well, there are emerging tools for monitoring green bonds on blockchain <span class="citation" data-cites="christodoulouBlockchainbasedFrameworkEffective2023">(Christodoulou et al., 2023)</span>. <span class="citation" data-cites="qinBlockchainMarketGreen2023">(Qin et al., 2023)</span> finds evidence that the combination of green bonds and blockchains are an enabler carbon neutrality in China.

<p>In institutional finance, the Norwegian $1.3T USD sovereign wealth fund (the world’s largest) started a divestment trend in 2016 by divesting first from coal following by divesting from oil, gas and coal extracting companies <span class="citation" data-cites="benmartinWorldLargestWealth2017 holgerNorwaySovereignWealthFund2019">(Ben Martin, 2017; Holger, 2019)</span>. Their plan to reach net zero CO2e nonetheless only targets 2050. Furthermore, who would be the counterpart for such large transactions. The fund also announced divesting from Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, however has yet to sell any shares citing lack of buyers on the Moscow stock market.</p>
<p>University of California also followed suit with divestment of its $126B USD portfolio from oil and gas.</p>

<p>The first two decades of the 21st century have seen increasing economic thinking, looking to challenge, improve and upgrade capitalism to match our current environmental, social, and technological situation, often called <em>New Economics.</em> Some of these include behavioral economics, sustainable capitalism, regenerative capitalism, doughnut economics, ecological economics, blue economy, degrowth, attention economy, gift economy, intent economy, among others. There’s no lack of published books on changing capitalism, which goes to show there’s readership for these ideas. Build a new economic theory is out of scope for my thesis design, however I’ll focus on the parts of economic theory I believe are relevant for <em>interaction design</em>-ing for sustainability.</p>

<p>There are those looking for <em>new metrics</em>. One of the first innovators, already in 1972, was Buthan, with the <em>Gross National Happiness Index (GNH)</em>, which in turn inspired the UN, decades later, in 2012, to create the International Wellbeing and Happiness Conference and the International Happiness Day<span class="citation" data-cites="ribeiroGrossNationalHappiness2017 kameiUrbanizationCarbonNeutrality2021">(Ribeiro &amp; Lemos Marinho, 2017; Kamei et al., 2021)</span>.

<section id="classical-economics-vs-ecological-economics" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="classical-economics-vs-ecological-economics">Classical Economics vs Ecological Economics</h4>
<p>While Adam Smith is most famous for his concept of the <em>invisible hand</em> first appearing in <em>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</em> (1759) and further developed in his seminal work <em>The Wealth of Nations</em>, published in 1776, his writings also highlight the interdependence of economic actors, who through specialization increase productivity, but also increasingly dependent on each another as well as the role of empathy in individual actions <span class="citation" data-cites="atalAdamSmithHis2024">(Atal et al., 2024)</span>.</p>
<p>Ecological economics doesn’t necessarily argue with the foundation of classical economics, rather ecological economics finds the classical economics model and by extension neoclassical economics are <em>incomplete,</em> ignoring the physical limits of natural resources. Ecological economics draws attention to the interdependence of economy and the ecosystem; there are physical limits to economic growth on a planet with finite resources.</p>
<p>The biggest point of contention is the necessity of <em>economic growth</em>. The founder of ecological economics Herman Daly was talking about <em>prosperity without growth</em> more than two decades ago, focusing on the diminishing natural resources <span class="citation" data-cites="dalyGrowthEconomicsSustainable1997">(Daly, 1997)</span>. More recently.<span class="citation" data-cites="jacksonProsperityGrowthEconomics2009 jacksonProsperityGrowthFoundations2017">(Jackson, 2009, 2017)</span> have expanded on these ideas with recipes for a <em>post-growth</em> world, making the ideas seem more tangible and precise, yet mostly untested in the real world.</p>
<p>New economic thinkers are asking how can economic growth and sustainability be compatible. Some even ask if <em>economic growth</em> itself is the wrong goal? <span class="citation" data-cites="diduchEconomicGrowthWrong2020">(Diduch, 2020)</span>. Degrowth is the most famous contender in that branch of economics. Is Decoupling Economic Growth and CO2e Emissions Possible? Is Green Growth an oxymoron? No-one knows as it hasn’t been done before. Degrowth proponents are pessimistic it’s possible to decouple greenhouse gas emissions from economic growth; historical data shows does not show any decoupling. Some data from China shows decoupling?</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="doughnut-economics-and-regenerative-capitalism">Doughnut Economics and Regenerative Capitalism</h4>
<p><em>Doughnut Economics</em>, introduced in the eponymous book uses a simple visualization of a doughnut (donut) to help us grasp the big picture of the economy <em>embedded</em> inside the physical and social worlds <span class="citation" data-cites="raworthDoughnutEconomicsSeven2017">(Raworth, 2017)</span>. It allows one to see the social shortfall and ecological overshoot of nations at the same time <span class="citation" data-cites="fanningSocialShortfallEcological2021">(Fanning et al., 2021)</span>. The doughnut concept is simple and deep at the same time, a useful as social object to enable starting conversations with people from all walks of life, independent of their politics leanings. As Raworth calls it, it’s a <em>“self-portrait of humanity in the beginning of the 21st century”<strong>.</strong></em> Combining the <em>SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals)</em> inside the doughnut and the <em>Planetary Boundaries</em> (Earth’s ecological ceiling) outside the doughnut, leaves a space inside the donut represents a state of equilibrium and balance on spaceship Earth.</p>
<p>In some ways this Doughnut Economics can be described as a movement. Doughnut Action Labs enable local communities to build local donuts customized to local problems. While the ideas have not yet been implemented on a country-level, smaller scale doughnut economics’ success stories have inspired cities to take a comprehensive view of the doughnut of their own city with several EU cities adopting the vision <span class="citation" data-cites="teicherDoughnutEconomicsHas2021">(Jordan G.

<p>Greenwashing is one of the largest blockers of sustainability. Both the European Commission and the Chair of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Gary Gensler have called for more legislation to curb business greenwashing practices. <em>“If it’s easy to tell if milk is fat-free by just looking at the nutrition label, it might be time to make it easier to tell if”green” or “sustainable” funds are really what they say they are”</em> says Gensler <span class="citation" data-cites="ussecuritiesandexchangecommissionOfficeHoursGary2022">(US Securities and Exchange Commission, 2022)</span>. EU regulation for standardizing sustainability reporting is called the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) entered into force in 2023 as is being gradually ramped up until 2027.</p>
<p>Green investing only makes sense if it’s possible to distinguish sustainable investments from not sustainable ones. Humans feel as if choosing green is useless and give up. Sustainabile investing is firstly about changes in legislation which set stricter sustainability standards on companies (as discussed above). Secondly, increased transparency, new metrics, and new tools make it feasible to differentiate more sustainable companies from less sustainable ones.</p>

<p>Since the 1970s, international bodies, governments, and private corporations have developed sustainability measurement metrics, the prominent one being ESG (Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance) developed by the UN in 2005. This rating system has already been implemented or is in the process of being adopted on stock markets all over the world and has implications beyond the stock markets, allowing analysts to measure companies’ performance on the triple bottom line: the financial, social, and environmental metrics.</p>
<p>ESG gives banks a new tool to market and sell environmentally conscious opportunities to institutional investors, for example, universities - a case in point being the recent partnership between HSBC and the University of Edinburgh <span class="citation" data-cites="reidUniversityEdinburghGoes2020">(Reid, 2020)</span>. Another recent example is one of the largest private banks in Switzerland, Lombard Odier &amp; Co, when they launched a thematic bio-economy fund inspired by the words of The Prince of Wales, ‘Building a sustainable future is, in fact, the growth story of our time’ <span class="citation" data-cites="jerseyeveningpostCharlesAchievingSustainable2020">(Jersey Evening Post, 2020)</span>.</p>

<p>ESG Becomes a Shared Language.</p>
<p>The advice consultancies are providing to banks establishes a common language and helps banks to sell strategical alignment for long-term institutional sustainability in terms of environmental, social, and governance performance. PWC suggests <em>“asset managers educate their staff and client base. ‘It will be critical to build stronger ESG expertise among their employees by up-skilling existing staff on ESG principles and strategically scout for and integrate more diverse and ESG-trained talent’”</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="pwc2022GrowthOpportunity2020">(PWC, 2020)</span></p>
<p>While ESG is riddled with problems, it has started a common language and there are many ways how to improve it</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For AI-powered assistants to be able to provide guidance, metrics are needed to evaluate sustainable assets, and ESG provides the current state-of-the-art for this. The largest obstacle to eco-friendly investing is greenwashing where companies and governments try to portray an asset as green when in reality it’s not. A personal investing assistant can provide an interface to focus on transparency, highlighting data sources and limitations, to help users feel in control of their investment decisions, and potentially even provide large-scale consumer feedback on negative practices back to the business through infringement discovery.</p></li>
