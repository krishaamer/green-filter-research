## What is Sustainability?

*Sustainability* was first mentioned in @hannsscarlvoncarlowitzSylviculturaOeconomicaOder1713 in the context of forestry in his seminal book *Sylvicultura oeconomica* discussing sustainable forest management. The field is known today as *sustainable yield* of *natural capital* required to maintain *ecosystem services* [@peterkareivaNaturalCapitalTheory2011].

-   Climate data visualization has a long history, starting with ***Alexander von Humboldt,*** who revolutionized cartography by inventing the first isothermal maps around 1816, showing areas with similar temperature, variations in altitude and seasons.
-   @IsothermsSimplyEarth2023: computer models of Father of climatology Alexander von Humboldt Isotherms
-   @hontonForgottenFatherClimatology2022
-   @BrohanClimate2012 reports global temperature measurement starts from the 1880s where we have the first records from ships.
-   Industrial revolution

```
-   @leprovostSupplyMultipleEcosystem2022 study shows *biodiversity* as one key factor to maintain delivery of ecosystem services.

-   @keebleBrundtlandReportOur1988 reported in April 1987 that *'residents in high-income countries lead lifestyles incompatible with planetary boundaries'*. While my home Estonia at the time was considered low-income, a small nation on the verge of poverty behind the Iron Curtain occupation of the Soviet Occupy, we now in 2023, have indeed reached high-income status.

-   @korosecAmazonTaps2B2021 reports that Amazon's 2B USD to a Climate Pledge Fund earmarked to fix climate problems is invested in energy, logistics, and packaging startups, which will reduce material waste. "Good intentions don't work, mechanisms do," Amazon's founder Bezos is quoted in @cliffordHowThisPopular2022. It's an example of how money marketed as climate funding by the retail conglomerate means focus on reducing operational cost of running their business through automation and material savings.

-   Aldo Leopold proposed the ideas of land ethics. "A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise." in A Sand County Almanac

### Ecosystem Services

-   @dailyNatureServicesSocietal1997 proposed the idea of ecosystem services @costanzaValueWorldEcosystem1997 assessed the amount of ecosystem services provided.
-   @bousfieldCarbonPaymentsCan2022 reports there's evidence paying landowners for the ecosystem services their forests provide may reduce deforestation.
-   @hanEmbeddingNaturebasedSolutions2022 identifies nature-based solutions "land re-naturalization (such as afforestation and wetland restoration)"
-   @noriegaResearchTrendsEcosystem2018 attempts to quantify the ecosystem services (ES) provided by insects. While it can be assumed much of the flora and fauna are crucial for Earth's systems, science is still in the process of understanding and quantifying its contributions. Meanwhile the destruction pressure on ecosystems is rapidly increasing (cite A B C).

### Zero Waste Lifestyle and Minimalism

The opposite of overconsumption is the zero waste lifestyle. A movement of people living a simple life. This is always going to be a small percentage of people.

-   @tokyosimpleecolifeWhatLearnedMy2021
-   @costaHowFinnishCulture2018: Finnish socialists: minimalism

**For design: These movements are too small and require too much effort to be feasible for the app.**

### Nationally Determined Contributions

Scalable Climate Solutions: What really works on a large scale?

-   @climateanalyticsClimateActionTracker2023 Climate Action Tracker data portal allows to compare countries.

| Country or Region    | **NDC target**          |
|----------------------|-------------------------|
| China                | Highly insufficient     |
| Indonesia            | Highly insufficient     |
| Russia               | Critically insufficient |
| EU                   | Insufficient            |
| USA                  | Insufficient            |
| United Arab Emirates | Highly insufficient     |
| Japan                | Insufficient            |
| South Korea          | Highly insufficient     |
| Iran                 | Critically insufficient |
| Saudi Arabia         | Highly insufficient     |

-   @unfccc.secretariatNationallyDeterminedContributions2022
-   The State of Nationally Determined Contributions: 2022 @fransenStateNationallyDetermined2022 notes that the majority of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are dependent on financial assistance from the international community.

### Carbon Markets

-   @sipthorpeBlockchainSolutionsCarbon2022 compares traditional and blockchain-based solutions to carbon trading.
-   @liuIndepthWillChina2021 and @ivyyinCommodities2023China2023 China's national emissions trading scheme (ETS) started in 2021 priced at 48 yuan per tonne of CO2, averaged at 58 yuan in 2022.
-   @unitednationsenvironmentprogrammeunepEmissionsGapReport2021 report. "The Emissions Gap Report (EGR) 2021: The Heat Is On shows that new national climate pledges combined with other mitigation measures put the world on track for a global temperature rise of 2.7°C by the end of the century. That is well above the goals of the Paris climate agreement and would lead to catastrophic changes in the Earth's climate. To keep global warming below 1.5°C this century, the aspirational goal of the Paris Agreement, the world needs to halve annual greenhouse gas emissions in the next eight years.
-   @unitednationsenvironmentprogrammeunepEmissionsGapReport2021 report "If implemented effectively, net-zero emissions pledges could limit warming to 2.2°C, closer to the well-below 2°C goal of the Paris Agreement. However, many national climate plans delay action until after 2030. The reduction of methane emissions from the fossil fuel, waste and agriculture sectors could help close the emissions gap and reduce warming in the short term, the report finds. Carbon markets could also help slash emissions. But that would only happen if rules are clearly defined and target actual reductions in emissions, while being supported by arrangements to track progress and provide transparency."
-   @unitednationsenvironmentprogrammeEmissionsGapReport2022 2022 Emissions Gap report.

#### Fossil Fuels and Energy

There's evidence from several countries suggesting moving to renewal energy brings benefits:

-   @AMIN2022113224 suggests "removing fossil fuel subsidies and intra-sectoral electricity price distortions coupled with carbon taxes provides the highest benefits" for both the economy and the environment in Bangladesh.

-   @lowRethinkingNetZeroSystems2022 finds considerable uncertainty exists among experts which CO2 reduction methods among nature-based and technology-based are the most effective.

-   @luoControllingCommercialCooling2022 suggests using reinforcement learning to reduce energy use in cooling systems.

-   The true cost of products is hidden. The work is hidden.

-   @tilstedEndingFossilbasedGrowth2023 expects the fossil fuel industry to grow even faster.

#### Emission Scopes

-   @nationalpublicutilitiescouncilAnnualUtilityDecarbonization2022: The U.S. National Public Utilities Council (NPUC) decarbonization report provides a useful categorization of company emission scopes:

| Scope   | Source                         |
|---------|--------------------------------|
| Scope 1 | Direct emissions               |
| Scope 2 | Indirect electricity emissions |
| Scope 3 | Value chain emissions          |

#### Cap and Trade

-   Carbon Inequality: @chancelGlobalCarbonInequality2022 suggests "while one-tenth of the global population is responsible for nearly half of all emissions, half of the population emits less than 12% of it".

#### Carbon Credits

-   In Estonia, startups Arbonic and Single.Earth are trialing this approach in several forests.
-   Carbon Credit Retirement?

#### Carbon Capture

-   @vitilloRoleCarbonCapture2022 argues

-   @gaureTrueNotTrue2022: "98% of total electricity production is generated by wind power and solar; the remainder is covered by a backup technology."

-   **Important: "creating sustainability trust in companies in realtime"**

-   @howardPotentialIntegrateBlue2017 argues Oceans play crucial role in carbon capture.

#### Social Cost of Carbon

@kornekSocialCostCarbon2021 and @zhenSimpleEstimateSocial2018 suggest "The (Social Cost of Carbon) SCC measures the additional damage caused by an extra unit of emissions" with variations between countries (@tolSocialCostCarbon2019) and regions (@wangMeasurementChinaProvincial2022). @stanforduniversityProfessorsExplainSocial2021 defines the social cost of carbon "the cost of the damages created by one extra ton of carbon dioxide emissions"

@sternCarbonNeutralEconomy2022 reports carbon-neutral economy needs higher CO2 prices. @rennertComprehensiveEvidenceImplies2022: Carbon price should be 3,6x higher that it is currently (2022). @ritzGlobalCarbonPrice2022 argues optimal CO2 prices could be highly asymmetric, low in some countries and high (above the social cost of CO2) in countries where production is very polluting.

As shown in the Phillipines by @chengAssessingEconomicLoss2022, with increasing extreme weather events, "businesses are more likely to emerge in areas where infrastructure is resilient to climate hazards". @jerrettSmokeCaliforniaGreenhouse2022 says, In California, "Wildfires are the second most important source of emissions in 2020" and "Wildfires in 2020 negate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from other sectors."

@linOpportunitiesTackleShortlived2022 says, apart from CO2, reduction of other atmospheric pollutants, such as non-CO2 greenhouse gases (GHGs) and short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) is required for climate stability.

-   @wangMultimodelAssessmentClimate2022: Quantifying climate damage proposes scenarios of climate damage.

-   Ethereum blockchain and animal rights. "Blockchain can provide a transparent, immutable record of the provenance of products. This can be especially useful for verifying claims made about animal welfare. For example, products claiming to be"free-range," "organic," or "sustainably sourced" could have their entire lifecycle recorded on the blockchain, from birth to shelf, allowing consumers to verify these claims."

#### Oracles for Sustainability Data

Intersection with finance and Real World Data.

A data oracle is the concept of a source of real-world data which can be ingested through an application programming interface (API) by, for example, a blockchain system. There are many databases of sustainability information which could serve as an oracle for "green filter", including carbon labeling, packaging, transportation, consumption, and waste.

-   @ethereumOracles2023

-   @caldarelliOvercomingBlockchainOracle2020 notes it's a challenge to ensure the accuracy and trustworthiness of real-world data from Oracles.

-   @bradydaleChainlinkFounderSays2021 and @chainlinkNewReportBlockchains2022: The largest Oracle provider ChainLink founder Sergey Nazarov believes the collaboration of oracles and blockchains can make carbon credits more trustworthy.

-   IPCI OpenLitterMap G.I.D Coin Regen Network

#### Ethics and Cruelty

Can data transparency provide tools for reducing cruelty.

-   Cruelty free brands
-   Rank companies based on sustainability
-   BCorp
-   ESG
-   Trash found in ocean / nature etc
-   Help you to decide: what to buy, how to save, where to invest
-   Increase your investment point by matching with your contribution /.
-   Point of Sales integration (know the SKU you buy). Integrate to the financial eco footprint (no need to scan the product). What's the name of the startup that does this?
-   Precision Fermentation and Cultivated Meat: Meat products without farm animals

### Biomarkers vs Ecomarkers (Ecological Indicators)

-   **Blood testing and biomarkers allow people to track their health. I'm introducing the concept of 'eco-markers' to follow the sustainability of human activities.**

-   There is a parallel in health to sustainability and indeed both are inextricably linked.

-   @appleEmpoweringPeopleLive2022: In a 2022 report Apple outlines its plans to : "Empowering people to live a healthier day"

-   @appleWhatNewHealthKit2022 What's new in HealthKit

-   What would that look like for sustainability?

-   Empowering people to live a sustainable day

-   @sarahludwigrauschSustainabilityYourHealth2021: "Human health is central to all sustainability efforts.", "All of these (food, housing, power, and health care), and the stress that the lack of them generate, play a huge role in our health," Hollis says."

-   @PublicHealthLinkages2013

-   @guidottiHealthSustainabilityIntroduction2015

-   "Sustainability is important for many reasons including: Environmental Quality -- In order to have healthy communities, we need clean air, natural resources, and a nontoxic environment."

## **Environmental Degradation**

### Growing Population

-   According to @theeconomictimesClimateChangeEarth2022, in November 2022, Planet Earth's population reached 8 Billion people.
-   The future population projections in @unitednationsdepartmentofeconomicandsocialaffairspopulationdivisionWorldPopulationProspects2022 predict 8.5B people by 2030 and 9.7B by 2050.
-   While population growth puts higher pressure on Earth's resources, some research shows the effect is more from wasteful lifestyles than the raw number of people [@cardinaleBiodiversityLossIts2012] **???. NEED ACCESS!!**
-   @bowlerMappingHumanPressures2020

### Overconsumption

-   Overconsumption is one of the root causes of climate change and marine plastic pollution. @FORD2022150392 and @laversFarDistractionPlastic2022 suggest strong linkage of climate change and marine plastic pollution "along with other stressors that threaten the resilience of species and habitats sensitive to both climate change and plastic pollution".
-   @ivanovaQuantifyingPotentialClimate2020: "Around 2/3 of global GHG emissions are directly and indirectly linked to household consumption, with a global average of about 6 tonnes CO2 equivalent per capita."
-   @mobergMobilityFoodHousing2019 reports daily human activities emission contribution on average in France, Germany, Norway and Sweden:

| Emission Share | Category |
|----------------|----------|
| 21%            | Housing  |
| 30%            | Food     |
| 34%            | Mobility |
| 15%            | Other    |

-   According to @debnathSocialMediaEnables2022 39% of global CO2 emissions comes from the building sector.

### Biodiversity Loss

-   @uebtBiodiversityBarometer2022 reports "Biodiversity awareness is now at 72% or higher in all countries sampled, compared to only 29% or higher across countries sampled in 2009."
-   @unitHistoryConvention2023: The history of the United Nations Convention on Biodiversity goes back to 1988, when the working group was founded
-   @almondr.e.a.LivingPlanetReport reports, the number of species killed, mass destruction of nature. "69% decline in the relative abundance of monitored wildlife populations around the world between 1970 and 2018. Latin America shows the greatest regional decline in average population abundance (94%), while freshwater species populations have seen the greatest overall global decline (83%)."
-   @unepCOP15EndsLandmark2022: **The Convention on Biodiversity 2022 (COP15) adopted the first global biodiversity framework to accompany climate goals.**

### Deforestation

-   @fredericsimonEuropeRapidlyLosing2022 Due to deforestation, Europe rapidly losing its forest carbon sink.

-   Burning of biomass undermines carbon capture.

### Clean Water

-   @kochOpinionArizonaRace2022 (**Need access!)**

### Air Pollution

Clean air is a requirement

-   Grounbreaking research by @lim1MOAirPollutioninduced2022 analyzed over 400000 individuals in England, South Korea and Taiwan establishes exposure to 2.5μm PM (PM2.5) air pollution as a cause for lung cancer. @bouscasseDesigningLocalAir2022 finds strong health and economic benefits across the board from air pollution reduction in France.
-   In @hannahdevlinCancerBreakthroughWakeup2022, prof Tony Mok, of the Chinese University of Hong Kong: "We have known about the link between pollution and lung cancer for a long time, and we now have a possible explanation for it. As consumption of fossil fuels goes hand in hand with pollution and carbon emissions, we have a strong mandate for tackling these issues -- for both environmental and health reasons."
-   @marialuisfernandesRealityCheckIndustrial2023 EU has legislation in progress to curb industrial emissions.

**Design Implications**: *People live in the polluted areas are so used to it. What app to wake them up? "You live in a highly polluted area. Here's the TOP 10 companies causing pollution. Here's what you can do."*

### Disasters

Large ones that get international news coverage:

-   Chernobyl
-   Exxon Valdez
-   Deepwater Horizon
-   the Great Pacific Garbage Patch
-   Fukushima
-   @volkovaEffectsPrescribedFire2021 increased risk of wildfires due to climate change.
-   @martinez-alierMappingEcologicalDistribution2021 and @martinez-alierReplyOrihuelaExtractivism2022 as well as @scheidelEnvironmentalConflictsDefenders2020 cover how EJAtlas tracks environmental justice cases around the world. Dispues in @eerolaCorporateConductCommodity2022.

## Conclusion

-   A wide range of legislative proposals, targets, organizations, and goals already exists across Europe. Upcoming laws will harmonize approaches to sustainability and raise standards for all members countries, in turn influencing producers who wish to sell in the EU common market.

-   In unison, the reviewed technologies and practices move us closer to enabling *realtime ESG*: up-do-date transparent information about how our product are produced. Realtime ESG is necessary a building block to enable consumers and investors make more accurate, real-world purchase decisions.
