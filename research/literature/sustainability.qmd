# What is Sustainability?

-   *Sustainability* was first mentioned in 1713 by *Hans Carl von Carlowitz* in the context of forestry in his seminal book (@hannsscarlvoncarlowitzSylviculturaOeconomicaOder1713) discussing sustainable forest management. The field is known today as *sustainable yield* of *natural capital* required to maintain *ecosystem services* (@peterkareivaNaturalCapitalTheory2011).

-   @leprovostSupplyMultipleEcosystem2022: Contemporary studies have shown *biodiversity* as one key factor to maintain delivery of ecosystem services.

-   @keebleBrundtlandReportOur1988 reported in April 1987 (a few months after I was born) that *'residents in high-income countries lead lifestyles incompatible with planetary boundaries'*. While my home Estonia at the time was considered low-income, a small nation on the verge of poverty behind the Iron Curtain occupation of the Soviet Occupy, we now in 2023, have indeed reached high-income status.

-   Commodities!! --- the most effective things are --- food --- transport --- fashion? --- plant trees

-   @catherinecliffordHowThisPopular2022 reports that Amazon is committing 2B USD to a Climate Pledge Fund trying to find startup companies that can fix climate problems.

-   Amazon's founder Bezos. ″'Good intentions don't work, mechanisms do'".

-   @mobergMobilityFoodHousing2019 reports daily human activities emission contribution on average in France, Germany, Norway and Sweden:

| Emission Share | Category |
|----------------|----------|
| 21%            | Housing  |
| 30%            | Food     |
| 34%            | Mobility |
| 15%            | Other    |

## Biodiversity

-   @uebtBiodiversityBarometer2022 reports "Biodiversity awareness is now at 72% or higher in all countries sampled, compared to only 29% or higher across countries sampled in 2009."
-   United Nations Convention on Biodiversity

## Pollution

### Clean Water

-   https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/26/opinion/arizona-water-colorado-river-saudi-arabia.html (**Need access!)**

### Air Pollution and Clean Air

-   Grounbreaking research by @lim1MOAirPollutioninduced2022 analyzed over 400000 individuals in England, South Korea and Taiwan establishes exposure to 2.5μm PM (PM2.5) air pollution as a cause for lung cancer. @bouscasseDesigningLocalAir2022 finds strong health and economic benefits across the board from air pollution reduction in France.
-   In @hannahdevlinCancerBreakthroughWakeup2022, prof Tony Mok, of the Chinese University of Hong Kong: "We have known about the link between pollution and lung cancer for a long time, and we now have a possible explanation for it. As consumption of fossil fuels goes hand in hand with pollution and carbon emissions, we have a strong mandate for tackling these issues -- for both environmental and health reasons."

**Design Implications**: *People live in the polluted areas are so used to it. What app to wake them up? "You live in a highly polluted area. Here's the TOP 10 companies causing pollution. Here's what you can do."*

### Housing

-   According to @debnathSocialMediaEnables2022 39% of global CO2 emissions comes from the building sector.

### Carbon Labeling

-   @briankatemanCarbonLabelsAre2020: Carbon labeling is voluntary and practiced by only a handful of companies. The U.S. restaurant chain *Just Salad* , U.K.-based vegan meat-alternative *Quorn* and plant milk *Oatly* provide carbon labeling on their products.

-   Ibid and @climatepartnerLabellingCarbonFootprint2020: Companies like ClimatePartner and Carbon Calories offers labeling consumer goods with emission data as a service.

-   @thecarbontrustHowReduceYour: The Carbon Trust reports it's certified 27 thousand product footprints.

-   @crippaCO2EmissionsAll2022 shows global emissions 4.81 tonnes CO2 per capita. @worldresourcesinstituteCO2EmissionsMetric2020 shows the top 5 largest per capita CO2 emissions come from Oil Producers - Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, Brunei Darussalam in 2020.

-   @europeancommission.jointresearchcentre.CO2EmissionsAll2022 provides CO2 emissions for all the countries around the world, per total emissions the top 10 are China, U.S.A. the European Union, India, Russia, Japan, Iran, South Korea, Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia as of 2021.

-   @ivanovaQuantifyingPotentialClimate2020: The average per capita carbon footprint of North America 13.4, Europe 7.5, Africa and the Middle East 1.7 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per capita.

-   @ivanovaQuantifyingPotentialClimate2020 "establish consumption options with a high mitigation potential measured in tons of CO2eq/capita/yr."

-   55% of emissions come from energy production.

-   @americanpressinstituteKnowingNewsHow2022 finds that only 37% percent of U.S. Gen-Z and Millenials follow news related to environmental issues.

-   @cohenPotentialRoleCarbon2012a argues carbon labels do influence consumer choice towards sustainability.

### Growing Population

-   According to @theeconomictimesClimateChangeEarth2022, in November 2022, Planet Earth's population reached 8 Billion people.
-   The future population projections in @unitednationsdepartmentofeconomicandsocialaffairspopulationdivisionWorldPopulationProspects2022 predict 8.5B people by 2030 and 9.7B by 2050.
-   While population growth puts higher pressure on Earth's resources, some research shows the effect is more from wasteful lifestyles than the raw number of people (**FIND CITATION**).

### Overconsumption, Climate Change, Pollution

-   In @anthonyleiserowitzInternationalPublicOpinion2022, a large scale study on Meta's Facebook (n=108946), "Respondents in Spain (65%), Sweden (61%), and Taiwan (60%) are the most likely to say that climate change is mostly caused by human activities".
-   Overconsumption is one of the root causes of climate change and marine plastic pollution.
-   @FORD2022150392 and @laversFarDistractionPlastic2022 suggest strong linkage of climate change and marine plastic pollution "along with other stressors that threaten the resilience of species and habitats sensitive to both climate change and plastic pollution".
-   Estonian Green Deal Action Plan (Eesti Rohepöörde Tegevusplaan) https://valitsus.ee/valitsuse-eesmargid-ja-tegevused/rohepoliitika/tegevusplaan
-   @wwfForestsReducingEU2022 **case study highlights how 4 biodiverse regions Cerrado in Brazil, Chaco in Argentina, Sumatra in Indonesia, and the Cuvette Centrale in Democratic Republic of Congo are experiencing rapid destruction due to consumer demand in the European Union.**
-   https://www.wri.org/insights/how-build-circular-economy
-   "Around two-thirds of global GHG emissions are directly and indirectly linked to household consumption, with a global average of about 6 tCO2eq/cap."
-   @armstrongmckayExceedingGlobalWarming2022 discusses tipping points

### Fossil Fuels and Energy

There's evidence from several countries suggesting moving to renewal energy brings benefits:

-   @AMIN2022113224 suggests "removing fossil fuel subsidies and intra-sectoral electricity price distortions coupled with carbon taxes provides the highest benefits" for both the economy and the environment in Bangladesh.

-   @lowRethinkingNetZeroSystems2022 finds considerable uncertainty exists among experts which CO2 reduction methods among nature-based and technology-based are the most effective.

-   @luoControllingCommercialCooling2022 suggests using reinforcement learning to reduce energy use in cooling systems.

### Make a 'Sustainability Flywheel' graphic, like that of Amazon's

-   The true cost of products is hidden. The work is hidden.

### Forests

-   @fredericsimonEuropeRapidlyLosing2022 Europe rapidly losing its forest carbon sink.

-   Burning of biomass undermines carbon capture.

## Oracles for Sustainability Data

A data oracle is the concept of a source of real-world data which can be ingested through an API by, for example, a blockchain system. There are many databases of sustainability information which could serve as an oracle for "green filter", including carbon labeling, packaging, transportation, consumption, and waste.

-   @ethereumOracles2023

-   @caldarelliOvercomingBlockchainOracle2020 notes it's a challenge to ensure the accuracy and trustworthiness of real-world data from Oracles.

-   @bradydaleChainlinkFounderSays2021 and @chainlinkNewReportBlockchains2022: The largest Oracle provider ChainLink founder Sergey Nazarov believes the collaboration of oracles and blockchains can make carbon credits more trustworthy.

## Provenance and Traceability

-   Ethereum blockchain and animal rights. "Blockchain can provide a transparent, immutable record of the provenance of products. This can be especially useful for verifying claims made about animal welfare. For example, products claiming to be"free-range," "organic," or "sustainably sourced" could have their entire lifecycle recorded on the blockchain, from birth to shelf, allowing consumers to verify these claims."

## Biomarkers vs Ecomarkers

-   There is a parallel in health to sustainability and indeed both are inextricably linked.

-   Healthkit

-   In a 2022 report Apple outlines its plans to : "Empowering people to live a healthier day" https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/Health-Report-July-2022.pdf

-   https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10005/

-   What would that look like for sustainability?

-   Empowering people to live a sustainable day

### Disasters

-   Chernobyl, Exxon Valdez, Deepwater Horizon, the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, and Fukushima

### Scalable Climate Solutions

-   What really works on a large scale?

## Nationally Determined Contributions

-   Climate action tracker https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/
-   "triple turn"
-   lack of transparency
-   Call for GOP contributors' transparency https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs/ndc-synthesis-report
-   The State of Nationally Determined Contributions: 2022 @fransenStateNationallyDetermined2022 notes that the majority of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are dependent on financial assistance from the international community.

### Health

-   https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/features/sustainability-health "Human health is central to all sustainability efforts."All of these (food, housing, power, and health care), and the stress that the lack of them generate, play a huge role in our health," Hollis says."

-   @PublicHealthLinkages2013

-   @guidottiHealthSustainabilityIntroduction2015

-   "Sustainability is important for many reasons including: Environmental Quality -- In order to have healthy communities, we need clean air, natural resources, and a nontoxic environment."

### Emission Scopes

-   @nationalpublicutilitiescouncilAnnualUtilityDecarbonization2022 The U.S. National Public Utilities Council (NPUC) utility decarbonization report provides a useful categorization of company emissions:

| Scope   | Source                         |
|---------|--------------------------------|
| Scope 1 | Direct emissions               |
| Scope 2 | Indirect electricity emissions |
| Scope 3 | Value chain emissions          |

### Greenwashing

-   @ussecuritiesandexchangecommissionOfficeHoursGary2022 Both the European Commission and the Chair of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Gary Gensler have called for more legislation to curb business greenwashing practices.

-   @andreVoluntaryCarbonNeutral2022. Until new legislation is in place (2030 in the EU), consumer awareness is crucial as currently most emission-reduction programs are voluntary and thus affected by consumer demand.

-   Greenwashing is a large detractor from environmental action as it's difficult to know what is sustainable and what is not. Reading EU Commission's proposals, one might think the politicians have everything under control, we can relax and continue the same lifestyles as before. Unfortunately, this is not true. As with ESG, while the good intentions may be there, the reality is emissions keep rising, while they should be falling. It's possible to curb greenwashing!

-   Examples of greenwashing:

    @geoffreysupranThreeShadesGreen2022 Greenwashing is widespread in company social media communications.

-   @purkissBigCompostExperiment2022 highlights the confusion between compostable and biodegradable plastics and public misunderstanding what happens to these plastics when they reach the landfill. For example, "Most plastics marketed as"home compostable" don't actually work, with as much as 60% failing to disintegrate after six months"

-   @napperEnvironmentalDeteriorationBiodegradable2019: Shopping bags marketed as *biodegradable* don't show deterioration after 3 years in salt-water sea environment .

-   @fredericsimonCommissionFireIncluding2020 and @kirataylorEUPlanPuts2021: While the EU has proposed legislation to curb greenwashing, EU climate policy itself has been criticized for greenwashing.

-   Sometimes greenwashing comes under legislative protection. @boothBurningCarbonSink2022 describe how "A recent investigation shows illegal logging of protected areas in eastern European countries that supplies residential wood pellets in Italy. Belgium, Denmark, and the Netherlands are importing pellets from Estonia, where protected areas are logged for pellets and the country has lost its forest carbon sink, despite large-scale wood pellet plants being certified 'sustainable' by the Sustainable Biomass Program".

A number of new AI-based tools aim to find instances of greenwashing.

### Carbon Markets

-   "The Emissions Gap Report (EGR) 2021: The Heat Is On shows that new national climate pledges combined with other mitigation measures put the world on track for a global temperature rise of 2.7°C by the end of the century. That is well above the goals of the Paris climate agreement and would lead to catastrophic changes in the Earth's climate. To keep global warming below 1.5°C this century, the aspirational goal of the Paris Agreement, the world needs to halve annual greenhouse gas emissions in the next eight years.

-   @unitednationsenvironmentprogrammeunepEmissionsGapReport2021 report "If implemented effectively, net-zero emissions pledges could limit warming to 2.2°C, closer to the well-below 2°C goal of the Paris Agreement. However, many national climate plans delay action until after 2030. The reduction of methane emissions from the fossil fuel, waste and agriculture sectors could help close the emissions gap and reduce warming in the short term, the report finds. Carbon markets could also help slash emissions. But that would only happen if rules are clearly defined and target actual reductions in emissions, while being supported by arrangements to track progress and provide transparency."

-   @unitednationsenvironmentprogrammeEmissionsGapReport2022 2022 Emissions Gap report.

### Inflation Reduction Act

### Carbon Inequality

-   @chancelGlobalCarbonInequality2022 suggests "while one-tenth of the global population is responsible for nearly half of all emissions, half of the population emits less than 12% of it".

### Actionable Insights

-   https://news.stanford.edu/2021/06/07/professors-explain-social-cost-carbon/

-   @kornekSocialCostCarbon2021 and @zhenSimpleEstimateSocial2018 suggest "The (Social Cost of Carbon) SCC measures the additional damage caused by an extra unit of emissions" with variations between countries (@tolSocialCostCarbon2019) and regions (@wangMeasurementChinaProvincial2022).

-   @sternCarbonNeutralEconomy2022 reports carbon-neutral economy needs higher CO2 prices.

-   @howardPotentialIntegrateBlue2017 argues Oceans play crucial role in carbon capture.

-   @ritzGlobalCarbonPrice2022 says Carbon prices are highly asymmetric.

-   @linOpportunitiesTackleShortlived2022 says, apart from CO2, reduction of other atmospheric pollutants, such as non-CO2 greenhouse gases (GHGs) and short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) is required for climate stability.

-   As shown in the Phillipines by @chengAssessingEconomicLoss2022, with increasing extreme weather events, "businesses are more likely to emerge in areas where infrastructure is resilient to climate hazards"

-   @jerrettSmokeCaliforniaGreenhouse2022 says, In California, "Wildfires are the second most important source of emissions in 2020" and "Wildfires in 2020 negate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from other sectors."

-   Quantifying climate damage (@wangMultimodelAssessmentClimate2022) proposes scenarios of climate damage.

### Ecosystem Services

-   @bousfieldCarbonPaymentsCan2022 reports there's evidence paying landowners for the ecosystem services their forests provide may reduce deforestation. In Estonia, startups Arbonic and Single.Earth are trialing this approach in several forests.
-   @hanEmbeddingNaturebasedSolutions2022 identifies nature-based solutions "land re-naturalization (such as afforestation and wetland restoration)"
-   @noriegaResearchTrendsEcosystem2018 attempts to quantify the ecosystem services (ES) provided by insects. While it can be assumed much of the flora and fauna are crucial for Earth's systems, science is still in the process of understanding and quantifying its contributions. Meanwhile the destruction pressure on ecosystems is rapidly increasing (cite A B C).

### Biodiversity

-   @almondr.e.a.LivingPlanetReport reports, the number of species killed, mass destruction of nature. "69% decline in the relative abundance of monitored wildlife populations around the world between 1970 and 2018. Latin America shows the greatest regional decline in average population abundance (94%), while freshwater species populations have seen the greatest overall global decline (83%)."

-   **The Convention on Biodiversity 2022 (COP15) adopted the first global biodiversity framework to accompany climate goals (*ADD CITATION*).**

### Carbon Capture

-   @vitilloRoleCarbonCapture2022 argues

-   @gaureTrueNotTrue2022: "98% of total electricity production is generated by wind power and solar; the remainder is covered by a backup technology."

## Data Visualisation History

-   @BrohanClimate2012 reports global temperature measurement starts from the 1880s where we have the first records from ships.
-   Industrial revolution
-   Data Data Visualisation has a Long history, starting with Alexander von Humboldt, who revolutionized cartography by inventing the first isothermal maps around 1938, showing areas with similar temperature, variations in altitude and seasons.

```
## Conclusion

-   A wide range of legislative proposals, targets, organizations, and goals already exists across Europe. Upcoming laws will harmonize approaches to sustainability and raise standards for all members countries, in turn influencing producers who wish to sell in the EU common market.

-   In unison, the reviewed technologies and practices move us closer to enabling *realtime ESG*: up-do-date transparent information about how our product are produced. Realtime ESG is necessary a building block to enable consumers and investors make more accurate, real-world purchase decisions.
