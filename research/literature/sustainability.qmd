## What is Sustainability?

*Sustainability* was first mentioned in [@hannsscarlvoncarlowitzSylviculturaOeconomicaOder1713] in the context of forestry and discussing sustainable forest management in his seminal book *Sylvicultura oeconomica*. The field is known today as *sustainable yield* of *natural capital* required to maintain *ecosystem services* [@peterkareivaNaturalCapitalTheory2011]. Aldo Leopold proposed the idea of *land ethics* as *"\[a\] thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise"* in his seminal book A Sand County Almanac[@leopoldSandCountyAlmanac1972]. The 1987 United Nations' Brundtland Report (Our Common Future) defined sustainable development as *"Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs"* [@worldcommissiononenvironmentanddevelopmentOurCommonFuture1987].

## Ecological Indicators of the Biosphere

Sustainability can be measured using a variety of ***ecological indicators***.

@dinersteinEcoregionBasedApproachProtecting2017 identifies 846 terrestrial ecoregions.

-   Svalbard Seed Vault
-   @jacksonMaterialConcernsPollution1996 *preventive environmental management*
-   @jacksonProsperityGrowthFoundations2017 limits to growth update
-   Ecological Indicators (I like the name Ecomarkers) for Earth are like Biomarkers in human health.

Some argue sustainability is not enough and we should work on regeneration of natural habitats.

### The Climate

#### The Price of Climate Change

Long term cost is more than short-term gains.

#### Climate Data Vizualisation

Climate data visualization has a long history, starting with ***Alexander von Humboldt,*** the founder of climatology, who revolutionized cartography by inventing the first *isothermal maps* around the year 1816; these maps showed areas with similar temperature, variations in altitude and seasons in different colors [@hontonForgottenFatherClimatology2022]. Humboldt's isotherms are now available as 3D computer models in [@IsothermsSimplyEarth2023].

Earth's physical systems are very sensitive to small changes in temperature, which was not understood until 30 years ago [@mckibbenEndNature2006].

-   Industrial revolution: : "transition to a low carbon economy presents challenges and potential economic benefits that are comparable to those of previous industrial revolutions" [@pearsonLowCarbonIndustrial2012].
-   Tragedy of the commons: [@meisingerTragedyIntangibleCommons2022; @lopezClimateChangeTimes2022; @muraseSevenRulesAvoid2018].

### Climatech

How are large corporations responding to the climate crisis?

Lack of leadership. @capgeminiWorldBalanceWhy2022: "Many business leaders see sustainability as costly obligation rather than investment in the future". @hoikkalaCEOSeesTerrible2019: for example the CEO of the Swedish clothing producer H&M, one of the largest fast-fashion in the world, recognizes the potential impact of conscious consumers as a threat.

Many large businesses have tried to find solutions by launching climate-focused funding. [@korosecAmazonTaps2B2021] reports that Amazon's 2B USD to a Climate Pledge Fund earmarked to fix climate problems is invested in energy, logistics, and packaging startups, which will reduce material waste. "Good intentions don't work, mechanisms do," Amazon's founder Bezos is quoted as saying in [@cliffordHowThisPopular2022]. Walmart is taking a similar approach, having launched a project in 2017 to set CO~2~ reduction targets in collaboration with its suppliers @walmartProjectGigaton2023. These examples underlines how money marketed as climate funding by retail conglomerates means focus on reducing operational cost of running their business through automation and material savings.

Large corporations such as Nestle and Coca Cola support the biodiversity law to have a level playing field for business [@greensefaNatureVoteSuccess2023].

-   @PublicHealthLinkages2013

-   @guidottiHealthSustainabilityIntroduction2015

-   "Sustainability is important for many reasons including: Environmental Quality -- In order to have healthy communities, we need clean air, natural resources, and a nontoxic environment."

-   @lowRethinkingNetZeroSystems2022 finds considerable uncertainty exists among experts which CO2 reduction methods among nature-based and technology-based are the most effective.

-   Pathways to drawdown

#### Planetary Boundaries

-   [@keebleBrundtlandReportOur1988] reported in April 1987 that *'residents in high-income countries lead lifestyles incompatible with planetary boundaries'*. While my home country Estonia at the time was considered low-income, a small nation in poverty behind the *Iron Curtain* occupation of the Soviet Occupy, we now in 2023, have indeed reached high-income status.

-   @haeggmanPlanetaryBoundariesAnalysis2018

### Ecosystem Services

@historyEcosystemServices2010 the history of the valuation of nature's services goes back to the 18th century when David Ricardo and Jean Baptiste Say discussed nature's *work*, however both considered it should be free. In 1997 @dailyNatureServicesSocietal1997 proposed the idea of ecosystem services and @costanzaValueWorldEcosystem1997 attempted to assess the amount of ecosystem services provided.

@leprovostSupplyMultipleEcosystem2022 study shows *biodiversity* as one key factor to maintain delivery of ecosystem services. @noriegaResearchTrendsEcosystem2018 attempts to quantify the ecosystem services (ES) provided by insects. While it can be assumed much of the flora and fauna are crucial for Earth's systems, science is still in the process of understanding and quantifying its contributions.

-   @MonetaryValuationNature2023 should we put a price on nature?
-   @bousfieldCarbonPaymentsCan2022 reports there's evidence paying landowners for the ecosystem services their forests provide may reduce deforestation.
-   Is it time to leave utilitarian environmentalism behind? @muradianEcosystemServicesNature2021

### **Environmental Degradation**

#### Growing Population

Earth's population reached 8 Billion people In November 2022 and population projections by predict 8.5B people by 2030 and 9.7B by 2050 [@theeconomictimesClimateChangeEarth2022; @unWorldPopulationProspects2022].

[@hassounFoodProcessingCurrent2023] forecasts increase of global food demand by 62% including impact of climate change.

-   While population growth puts higher pressure on Earth's resources, some research proposes the effect is more from wasteful lifestyles than the raw number of people [@cardinaleBiodiversityLossIts2012].

#### Slavery

In 2023, an estimated 50 million people are still in slavery around the world; lack of supply chain visibility hides forced labor and exploitation of undocumented migrants in agricultural work; 71% of enslaved people are estimated to be women. [@kunzAdoptionTransferabilityJoint2023; @borrelliCareSupportMaternity2023].

The UN SDG target 8.7 targets to eliminate all forms of slavery.

Slavery is connected to environmental degradation and climate change [@deckersparksGrowingEvidenceInterconnections2021]. Enslaved people are used in environmental crimes such as 40% of deforestation globally. Cobalt used in technological products is in risk of being produced under forced labor in the D.R. Congo [@sovacoolWhenSubterraneanSlavery2021]. In India and Pakistan, forced labor in brick kiln farms is possible to capture remotely from satellite images [@boydSlaverySpaceDemonstrating2018]. In effect, the need for cheap labor turns slavery into a *subsidy* keeping environmental degradation happening.

-   @christBlockchainTechnologyModern2021 estimates 20 million people are stuck inside corporate blockchains. The Global Slavery Index measures the ***Import Risk*** of having slavery inside its imports @walkfreeGlobalSlaveryIndex2023.

-   @hansvanleeuwenModernSlaveryGrace2023 slavery affects industries from fashion to technology, including sustainability enablers such as solar panels.

-   "commodification of human beings"

-   @anandchandrasekharWhySwitzerlandMatters2021: Trading commodities "Switzerland has a hand in over 50% of the global trade in coffee and vegetable oils like palm oil as well as 35% of the global volume of cocoa, according to government estimates." Can traders have more scrutiny over what they trade?

-   Modern Slavery Act.

#### Overpopulation

-   "Overpopulation is a major cause of biodiversity loss and smaller human populations are necessary to preserve what is left" @cafaroOverpopulationMajorCause2022.

#### Overconsumption

Overconsumption is one of the main drivers of climate change." Around 2/3 of global GHG emissions are directly and indirectly linked to household consumption, with a global average of about 6 tonnes CO~2~ equivalent per capita." [@reneechoHowBuyingStuff2020; @ivanovaQuantifyingPotentialClimate2020]

Overconsumption is also one of the root causes of plastic pollution. @FORD2022150392 and @laversFarDistractionPlastic2022 find strong linkage of climate change and marine plastic pollution "along with other stressors that threaten the resilience of species and habitats sensitive to both climate change and plastic pollution".

-   @laversFarDistractionPlastic2022 plastic pollution is pervasive around the Earth and is fundamentally linked to climate change

While the number on overconsumption are clear, the debate on overconsumption is so polarized, it's difficult to have a meaningful discussion of the topic [@ianoleOverconsumptionSocietyLookingglass2013].

-   Overconsumption and underinvestment.

-   Cities are responsible for 80% of the emissions @rosalescarreonUrbanEnergySystems2018

-   @mobergMobilityFoodHousing2019 reports daily human activities emission contribution on average in four European countries (France, Germany, Norway and Sweden).

| Emission Share | Category |
|----------------|----------|
| 21%            | Housing  |
| 30%            | Food     |
| 34%            | Mobility |

-   @williamsIntensificationWinterTransatlantic2013 higher CO~2~ concrentrations in the air can cause more turbulence for flights.

-   Warmer climate helps viruses and fungi spread @pressFungalDiseaseRapidly2023

### Biodiversity

@livingPlanetReport2022 reports, the number of species killed, mass destruction of nature. "69% decline in the relative abundance of monitored wildlife populations around the world between 1970 and 2018. Latin America shows the greatest regional decline in average population abundance (94%), while freshwater species populations have seen the greatest overall global decline (83%)."

Biodiversity loss is linked to overconsumption, weak legislation and lack of oversight. [@crennaBiodiversityImpactsDue2019] recounts European Union consumers' negative impact on biodiversity in countries where it imports food. @wwfForestsReducingEU2022 case study highlights how 4 biodiverse regions Cerrado in Brazil, Chaco in Argentina, Sumatra in Indonesia, and the Cuvette Centrale in Democratic Republic of Congo are experiencing rapid destruction due to consumer demand in the European Union. While the European Union (EU) has recently become a leader in sustainability legislation, biodiversity protection measures among private companies is very low @marco-fondevilaTrendsPrivateSector2023.

Meanwhile, there is some progress in biodiversity conservation. @uebtBiodiversityBarometer2022 reports "Biodiversity awareness is now at 72% or higher in all countries sampled, compared to only 29% or higher across countries sampled in 2009."

Similarly to climate protection, the UN has taken a leadership role in biodiversity protection. @unitHistoryConvention2023: The history of the United Nations Convention on Biodiversity goes back to 1988, when the working group was founded. @unepCOP15EndsLandmark2022: The Convention on Biodiversity 2022 (COP15) adopted the first global biodiversity framework to accompany climate goals.

#### ***Biodiversity Indicators***

Cutting edge research uses AI for listening to nature, assessing biodiversity based on species' sounds in the forest. Millions of detections of different species with machine learning passive acoustic AI models, can also assess species response to climate change [@aiforgoodListeningNatureHarnessing2023; @guerreroAcousticAnimalIdentification2023].

@mayWhyShouldWe2011 argues biodiversity loss is a concern for 3 points of views:

| View                 |                                                                                       |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Narrowly Utilitarian | Biodiversity is a resource of genetic novelties for the biotech industry.             |
| Broadly Utilitarian  | Humans depend upon biodiverse ecosystems.                                             |
| Ethical              | Humans have a responsibility to future generations to pass down a rich natural world. |

: From @mayWhyShouldWe2011.

#### Forest and Deforestion

Around 27% of Earth's land area is still covered by forests yet deforestation is widespread all around the world; highest rates of deforestation happened in the tropical rainforests of South America and Africa, mainly caused by agricultural cropland expansion (50% of all deforestation) and grazing land for farm animals to produce meat (38,5%), totaling close to 90% of global deforestation [@FRA2020Remote2022]. Forests are a crucial part of Earth's carbon cycle and the main natural CO~2~ capture system; due to deforestation, Europe rapidly losing its forest carbon sink [@fredericsimonEuropeRapidlyLosing2022].

Afforestation is different from reforestation, which takes into account biodiversity.

-   Burning of biomass undermines carbon capture.

#### Water

-   Clean water and water pollution
-   @kochOpinionArizonaRace2022 (**Need access!)**

#### Air

Air pollution is widespread around the planet, with 99% of Earth's human population being affected by bad air quality that does not meet WHO air quality guidelines, leading to health problems linked to 6.7 million premature deaths every year @worldhealthorganizationAmbientOutdoorAir2022. Grounbreaking research by @lim1MOAirPollutioninduced2022 analyzed over 400000 individuals in England, South Korea and Taiwan establishes exposure to 2.5μm PM (PM2.5) air pollution as a cause for lung cancer. @bouscasseDesigningLocalAir2022 finds strong health and economic benefits across the board from air pollution reduction in France. In @hannahdevlinCancerBreakthroughWakeup2022, prof Tony Mok, of the Chinese University of Hong Kong: "We have known about the link between pollution and lung cancer for a long time, and we now have a possible explanation for it. As consumption of fossil fuels goes hand in hand with pollution and carbon emissions, we have a strong mandate for tackling these issues -- for both environmental and health reasons".

Health and sustainability are inextricably linked. "Human health is central to all sustainability efforts.", "All of these (food, housing, power, and health care), and the stress that the lack of them generate, play a huge role in our health" [@sarahludwigrauschSustainabilityYourHealth2021].

The main way to combat air pollution is through policy interventions. @marialuisfernandesRealityCheckIndustrial2023 EU has legislation in progress to curb industrial emissions. If legislation is in place, causing bad air quality can become bad for business. @guHiddenCostsNongreen2023 links air pollution to credit interest rates for business loans in China; companies with low environmetal awareness and a history of environmental penalties pay 12 percent higher interest rates.

Clean air is a requirement.

#### Climate Change Disasters

Environmental activists have been calling attention to global warming for decades, yet the world has been slow to act [@mckibbenEndNature1989].

Global warming increases the risk of disasters and extreme weather events. As extreme temperatures are increasingly commonplace, there's increased risk of wildfires [@volkovaEffectsPrescribedFire2021]. Summers of 2022 and 2023 were the hottest on record so far, with extreme heat waves recorded in places around the world [@venturelliHighTemperatureCOVID192023; @serrano-notivoliUnprecedentedWarmthLook2023; @douglasThisSummerTrack2023; @EarthJustHad2023; @NOAAJune2023; @falconer123MillionHeat2023]. As temperatures rise, certain cities may become uninhabitable for humans @cbcradioExtremeHeatCould2021. The summer of 2023 saw extensive wildfires in Spain, Canada, and elsewhere; rapidly moving fires destroyed the whole city of Lāhainā in Hawaii \[CITE\]. The part of Earth where the *human climate niche* is becoming smaller [@mckibbenWhereShouldLive2023]. Some parts of South America have seen summer heat in the winter, with heatwaves with temperatures as high as 38 degrees [@livingstonItMidwinterIt2023].

- Observed changes in heatwaves [@perkins-kirkpatrickExtremeHeatClimate2023].

Climate-related disasters can spur action as extreme weather becomes visible to everyone. After large floods in South Korea in July 2023 with many victims, president Joon promised to begin taking global warming seriously and steer the country towards climate action @webSouthKoreaPresident2023; @afpKoreaPresidentVows2023; @aljazeeraDeathTollKorea2023. South Korea has a partnership with the European Union @europeancommissionEURepublicKorea2023.

The fossil energy production that's a large part of global CO2 emissions has caused several high-profile pollution events. Large ones that got international news coverage include Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon.

## Mitigation & Adaption

#### Cap & Trade

The share of CO~2~ emissions among people around the world is highly unequal across the world (referred to as ***Carbon Inequality***). @chancelGlobalCarbonInequality2022 reports "while one-tenth of the global population is responsible for nearly half of all emissions, half of the population emits less than 12%".

-   One example is the ICT sector.

-   @bajarinPCSalesAre Over 300 million PCs sold in 2022

### Emissions Trading Schemes

From Carbon Offsets to Carbon Credits

Retiring CO~2~ allowances

-   Facilitating citizens' access to CO~2~ emissions trading may be an efficient method to organize large-scale CO~2~ retiring @rousseEnvironmentalEconomicBenefits2008
-   "A carbon credit represents one tonne of carbon dioxide that has been prevented from entering or has been removed from the atmosphere" [@annawatsonCarbonCreditRetirements2023; @annawatsonDeepDiveCarbon2022].

As of 2023 there isn't a single global CO~2~ trading market but rather several local markets as described in the table below @InternationalCarbonMarket.

: CO~2~ credit trading markets around the world from @InternationalCarbonMarket.

Most of the world is not part of a CO~2~ market.

-   [@sipthorpeBlockchainSolutionsCarbon2022] compares traditional and blockchain-based solutions to carbon trading.
-   [@unitednationsenvironmentprogrammeunepEmissionsGapReport2021] report. "The Emissions Gap Report (EGR) 2021: The Heat Is On shows that new national climate pledges combined with other mitigation measures put the world on track for a global temperature rise of 2.7°C by the end of the century. That is well above the goals of the Paris climate agreement and would lead to catastrophic changes in the Earth's climate. To keep global warming below 1.5°C this century, the aspirational goal of the Paris Agreement, the world needs to halve annual greenhouse gas emissions in the next eight years.
-   [@unitednationsenvironmentprogrammeunepEmissionsGapReport2021] report "If implemented effectively, net-zero emissions pledges could limit warming to 2.2°C, closer to the well-below 2°C goal of the Paris Agreement. However, many national climate plans delay action until after 2030. The reduction of methane emissions from the fossil fuel, waste and agriculture sectors could help close the emissions gap and reduce warming in the short term, the report finds. Carbon markets could also help slash emissions. But that would only happen if rules are clearly defined and target actual reductions in emissions, while being supported by arrangements to track progress and provide transparency."
-   [@unitednationsenvironmentprogrammeEmissionsGapReport2022] 2022 Emissions Gap report.

### Carbon Markets

For the individual person, there's no direct access to CO~2~ markets, however there are different types of brokers who buy large amounts of carbon credits and resell them in smaller quantities to retail investors. "Carbon pricing is not there to punish people," says Lion Hirth @lionhirthLionHirthTwitter. "It's there to remind us, when we take travel, heating, consumption decisions that the true cost of fossil fuels comprises not only mining and processing, but also the damage done by the CO~2~ they release."

#### The Price of CO~2~

@sternCarbonNeutralEconomy2022 reports carbon-neutral economy needs higher CO~2~ prices. @rennertComprehensiveEvidenceImplies2022: Carbon price should be 3,6x higher that it is currently. @ritzGlobalCarbonPrice2022 argues optimal CO~2~ prices could be highly asymmetric, low in some countries and high (above the social cost of CO~2~) in countries where production is very polluting.

#### Voluntary Carbon Markets

Voluntary Carbon Markets (VCM) lack standardization and transparency @elakhodaiWhyVCMNeeds2023

***Carbon Credits*** are useful for private companies who wish to claim *carbon neutrality, climate positivity*, or other related claim, which might be viewed in good light by their clients or allow the companies to adhere to certain legislative requirements.

There are many companies which facilitate buy carbon credits as well as a few organizations focused on carbon credit verification.

-   In Estonia, startups Arbonic and Single.Earth are trialing this approach in several forests.

: Voluntary market CO~2~ prices on August 12, 2023; data from [@carboncreditsLiveCarbonPrices2023].

#### Fossil Fuels

Fossil fuels are what powers humanity as well as the largest source of CO~2~ emissions. @ieaGlobalEnergyReview2022 reports "Global CO~2~ emissions from energy combustion and industrial processes rebounded in 2021 to reach their highest ever annual level. A 6% increase from 2020 pushed emissions to 36.3 gigatonnes". As on June 2023, fossil fuel based energy makes up 82% of energy and is still growing @instituteEnergySystemStruggles2023. The 425 largest fossil fuel projects represent a total of over 1 gigatons in CO~2~ emissions, 40% of which were new projects @kuhneCarbonBombsMapping2022. @tilstedEndingFossilbasedGrowth2023 expects the fossil fuel industry to continue grow even faster. In July 2023, the U.K. granted hundreds of new oil and gas of project licenses in the North Sea [@RishiSunakGreenlight2023].

#### Renewable Energy

There's ample evidence from several countries suggesting moving to renewal energy brings environmental benefits:

-   @AMIN2022113224 suggests "removing fossil fuel subsidies and intra-sectoral electricity price distortions coupled with carbon taxes provides the highest benefits" for both the economy and the environment in Bangladesh.

-   @luoControllingCommercialCooling2022 suggests using reinforcement learning to reduce energy use in cooling systems.

-   The true cost of products is hidden. The work is hidden.

-   Montreal protocol eradicates CfCs and the ozone holes became whole again.

#### Emission Scopes

The U.S. National Public Utilities Council (NPUC) decarbonization report provides a useful categorization of ***emission scopes*** applicable to companies and for organizing emission reduction schemes [@nationalpublicutilitiescouncilAnnualUtilityDecarbonization2022]. For example, for consumers in Australian states and territories in 2018, 83% of the GHG emissions are Scope 3, meaning indirect emissions in the value chain @goodwinTargetingDegreesGlobal2023.

| Emission Scope | Emission Source                |
|----------------|--------------------------------|
| Scope 1        | Direct emissions               |
| Scope 2        | Indirect electricity emissions |
| Scope 3        | Value chain emissions          |

: From @nationalpublicutilitiescouncilAnnualUtilityDecarbonization2022.

One's scope 3 emissions are someone else's scope 1 emissions.

-   Mapping pollution sources in China @xieEcologicalCivilizationChina2021

#### Carbon Capture

Many technology startups focused on climate solutions (often referred to as climatech by the media), have proposed a range of approaches to CO~2~ reduction in the atmosphere.

-   @vitilloRoleCarbonCapture2022 illustrates how direct air capture of CO~2~ is difficult because of low concentration and CO~2~ capture at the source of the emissions is more feasible.

-   @gaureTrueNotTrue2022 simulate a CO~2~ free electricity generation system in the European Union where "98% of total electricity production is generated by wind power and solar; the remainder is covered by a backup technology.". The authors stipulate it's possible to power the EU without producing CO~2~ emissions.

-   **Important: "creating sustainability trust in companies in realtime"**

-   @howardPotentialIntegrateBlue2017 argues Oceans play crucial role in carbon capture.

#### Social Cost of Carbon

Sustainability is filled with complexities, where CO~2~ emission is compounded by biodiversity loss, child labor, slavery, poverty, prostitution, dangerous chemicals, and many other issues become intertwined [@tedxSustainableBusinessFrank2020]. One attempt to measure these complexities, is the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) which is defined as "additional damage caused by an extra unit of emissions" [@kornekSocialCostCarbon2021; @zhenSimpleEstimateSocial2018]. For example the cost of damages caused by "one extra ton of carbon dioxide emissions" [@stanforduniversityProfessorsExplainSocial2021]. SCC variations exists between countries [@tolSocialCostCarbon2019] and regions [@wangMeasurementChinaProvincial2022].

-   As shown in the Phillipines by @chengAssessingEconomicLoss2022, with increasing extreme weather events, "businesses are more likely to emerge in areas where infrastructure is resilient to climate hazards". @jerrettSmokeCaliforniaGreenhouse2022 says, In California, "Wildfires are the second most important source of emissions in 2020" and "Wildfires in 2020 negate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from other sectors."

-   @linOpportunitiesTackleShortlived2022 says, apart from CO~2~, reduction of other atmospheric pollutants, such as non-CO~2~ greenhouse gases (GHGs) and short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) is required for climate stability.

-   @wangMultimodelAssessmentClimate2022: Quantifying climate damage proposes scenarios of climate damage.

#### Nationally Determined Contributions

-   @unfcccNDC2022 The State of Nationally Determined Contributions

While most countries have not reached their Nationally Determined Contributions, the Climate Action Tracker data portal allows to compare countries [@climateanalyticsClimateActionTracker2023].

| Country or Region    | **NDC target**          |
|----------------------|-------------------------|
| China                | Highly insufficient     |
| Indonesia            | Highly insufficient     |
| Russia               | Critically insufficient |
| EU                   | Insufficient            |
| USA                  | Insufficient            |
| United Arab Emirates | Highly insufficient     |
| Japan                | Insufficient            |
| South Korea          | Highly insufficient     |
| Iran                 | Critically insufficient |
| Saudi Arabia         | Highly insufficient     |

## Eco-Design

***Designing for Sustainability aka Circular Design or Eco-Design*** encompasses all human activities, making this pursuit an over-arching challenge across all industries also known as circular economy. Assuming that as individuals we want to act in a sustainable way, how exactly would be go about doing that?

-   "Evolution of design for sustainability: From product design to design for system innovations and transitions"
-   @DELAPUENTEDIAZDEOTAZU2022718 **Life Cycle Assessment and environmental impact analysis are needed to provide eco-design scenarios.**
-   @europeanparliamentEcodesignSustainableProducts2022 proposal "On 30 March 2022, the European Commission put forward a proposal for a regulation establishing a general framework for setting eco-design requirements for sustainable products, repealing rules currently in force which concentrate on energy-related products only." Virginijus Sinkevičius, EU Commissioner for the Environment, Oceans and Fisheries, is quoted as describing eco-design "respects the boundaries of our planet" @europeancommissionGreenDealNew2022

### AI-Assisted Design

@guptaAnalysisArtificialIntelligencebased2023 argues software is key to building more sustainable products, already for decades. More recently, companies like AutoDesk are putting CO~2~ calculations inside their design software.

-   AI has the potential to provide the parameters for sustainability. @singhArtificialNeuralNetwork2023 proposes an AI tool for deciding the suitable life cycle design parameters.
-   @SustainabilityStartsDesign: "Sustainability starts in the design process, and AI can help".

### Circular Economy

Circular economy is a tiny part of the world economy. @circleeconomyCircularityGapReport2022 reports only 8.6% of world economy is circular and *100B tonnes of virgin materials* are sourced every year.

-   @mcgintyHowBuildCircular2020: How to Build a Circular Economy
-   @dullCircularSupplyChain2021 book
-   @chapmanDesignEmotionalDurability2009 argues in his seminal paper (and later in his book) for ***"Emotionally Durable Design"***, the simple idea that we hold to things we value and thus they are sustainable. We don't throw away a necklace gifted to us by mom, indeed this object might be passed down for centuries. @roseEnchantedObjectsInnovation2015 has a similar idea, where ***"Enchanted Objects"*** become so interlinked with us, we're unlikely to throw them away.
-   Growing public understanding of how nature works and intersects with our use of money.
-   @hedbergCircularEconomyRole2021 argues digitization and data sharing is a requirement for building a circular economy.

## Policy Context

### The Policy Context in Europe From 2023 to 2030

We have an opportunity to re-imagine how every product can be an eco-product and how they circulate in our circular economy.

Timeline of the Policy Context:

-   In 2019 by the von der Leyen commission adopted the European Union (EU) **Green Deal** strategy.

-   In 2021 the Commision proposed a goal of reducing CO2e emissions by 55% by 2030 under the *Fit for 55* policy package consisting of a wide range of economic measures.

-   In November 2022, the proposal was adopted by the EU Council and EU Parliament with an updated goal of 57% of CO2e reductions compared to 1990. This proposal is set to become a binding law for all EU member countries (@europeancommissionEuropeanGreenDeal2019; @europeancommissionSustainableEurope20302019; @EUReachesAgreement2022; @europeancouncilFit55EU2022).

-   In March 2022, the EU Circular Economy Action Plan was adopted, looking to make sustainable products *the norm* in EU and *empowering consumers* as described in @europeancommissionCircularEconomyAction2022. Each product covered by the policy is required to have a ***Digital Product Passport*** which enables improved processing within the supply chain and includes detailed information to empower consumers to understand the environmental footprint of their purchases. It's safe to say the large majority of products available today do not meet these criteria.

### European Green Deal

-   @EuropeanGreenDeal2021
-   @switch2greenEUGreenDeal2023

It's up to legislators to provide sustainable products on our marketplace... but until we do, use the green filter.

-   One of the EU goals is reducing consumption
-   Tacking our consumption habits
-   Europe is the hotbed of sustainability
-   @imanghoshMappedWhereAre2020
-   @lamoureuxNotableSustainableCompanies2018 Florida sustainable companies
-   @michaelhoulihanItOfficialCustomers2018 customers prefer sustainable companies
-   @rajagopalanInflationReductionAct2023: In the US, the *Inflation Reduction Act* provides funding to development of decarbonizing technologies and includes plans to combat air pollution, reduce green house gases and address environmental injustices.

### Ecodesign as Key Policy Tool

A large part of the proposal by @commissionEcodesignYourFuture2014 is ***eco-design***, as a large part of product lifecycle environmental impact is defined in the design process.

| Quality    |                   |                    |
|------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Durable    | Reparable         | Easy to recycle    |
| Reusable   | Easy to maintain  | Energy efficient   |
| Upgradable | Easy to refurbish | Resource efficient |

: The framework proposes 9 values to strive for in high quality products.

### Policy Around the World

Politics matters in sustainability.

In the European Union (EU), a wide range of legislative proposals, targets, organizations, and goals already exists across diverse countries. Upcoming laws aim to harmonize approaches to sustainability and raise standards for all members states, in turn influencing producers who wish to sell in the EU common market.

-   In Brazil, deforestation fell 60% in 1 year, based on remote satellite reconnaissance, after the election of a more pro-environment leadership @wattsAmazonDeforestationFalls2023.

-   @EUTaxonomySustainable report: The EU has a ***taxonomy of environmentally sustainable economic activities*** published by the Technical Expert Group (TEG) on sustainable finance.

-   The proposal for a Nature Restoration Law by the European Commission requiring member countries to restore 20% of EU's degraded ecosystems by 2030 and full restoration by 2050 has not yet passed @ScientistsUrgeEuropean2023 and is facing a backlash @davidpintoBacklashNatureRestoration2023.

### Waste Generation

@liuGlobalPerspectiveEwaste2023 reports, e--waste is growing 3%--5% every year, globally. @thukralExploratoryStudyProducer2023 identifies several barriers to e-waste management among producers including lack of awareness and infrastructure, attitudinal barriers, existing *informal* e-waste sector, and the need for an e-waste license.

### Extended Producer Responsibility

Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is a policy tool first proposed by Thomas Lindhqvist in Sweden in 1990 \[CITE\], aimed to encourage producers take responsibility for the entire life-cycle of their products, thus leading to more eco-friendly products. Nonetheless, EPR schemes do not guarantee circularity and may instead be designed around fees to finance waste management in linear economy models [@christiansenExtendedProducerResponsibility2021]. The French EPR scheme was upgraded in 2020 to become more circular [@jacquesvernierExtendedProducerResponsibility2021].

In any case, strong consumer legislation (such as EPR) has a direct influence on producers' actions. For example, in @hktdcresearchFranceExpandsProducer2022, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council notified textile producers in July 2022 reminding factories to produce to French standards in order to be able enter the EU market. @pengExtendedProducerResponsibility2023 finds that the ***Carbon Disclosure Project*** has been a crucial tool to empower ERP in Chinese auto-producers.

-   The success of EPR can vary per type of product. For car tires, the EPR scheme in the Netherlands claims a 100% recovery rate @campbell-johnstonHowCircularYour2020.

One type of legislation that works?

-   @steenmansFosteringCircularEconomy2023 Argues for the need to engage companies through legislation and shift from waste-centered laws to product design regulations.

-   In Europe, there's large variance between member states when in comes to textile recycling: while Estonia and France are the only EU countries where separate collection of textiles is required by law, in Estonia 100% of the textiles were burned in an incinerator in 2018 while in France textiles are covered by an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme leading to higher recovery rates (Ibid).

### Return, Repair, Reuse

-   There's a growing number of companies providing re-use of existing items.
-   @SmartSwap For example, Swap furniture in Estonia
