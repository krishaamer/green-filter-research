#### *Design Implications:* {#design-implications}

-   App shows traceability.

-   Help consumers to demand more.

#### Supply Chains {#supply-chains}

-   Finkenstadt and Handfield (2021) COVID19 pandemic highlighted the need to have real-time visibility into supply chains.

Circular design is possible if supply chains become circular.

-   Wagenvoort (2020) Self-driving supply chains.. (contact japanese factory?)

-   California Transparency in Supply Chains Act

-   Knight et al. (2022) new tools are needed to map supply chains.

-   Dutta et al. (2020) hundreds of paper researching blockchain use in supply change operations since 2017.

-   Van Wassenaer et al. (2023) Compares use cases for blockchains in enhancing traceability, transparency and cleaning up the supply chain. There are several technologies for tracking goods across the supply chain, from shipping to client delivery.

-   Ashraf and Heavey (2023) Solana blockchain and Sigfox internet of things (IoT) Integration for supply chain traceability.

-   Several startups are using distributed ledgers (blockchains) to track source material arriving to the factories and product movements from factories to markets. While blockchains enable securely tracing data, which is immutable (no possible to change the same record, only add data in new records).

-   Blockchain ledgers are useful for data sharing and auditing, as the time and place of data input can be guaranteed, and it will be easier to conduct a search on who inputted incorrect data, however the system still relies on correct data input. As the saying goes, “garbage in, garbage out”.

Blockchain supply chain companies as of summer 2023 include.

-   Traceability and animal rights. Animal rights vs animal welfare. Ethereum blockchain and animal rights. “Blockchain can provide a transparent, immutable record of the provenance of products. This can be especially useful for verifying claims made about animal welfare. For example, products claiming to be”free-range,” “organic,” or “sustainably sourced” could have their entire lifecycle recorded on the blockchain, from birth to shelf, allowing consumers to verify these claims.”

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[0] }} />

-   Another aspect of supply tracing is the treatment of workers and working conditions. Companies that intend to 2give supply chain a voice” by connecting workers directly to the consumer (even in anonymously, to protect the workers from retribution), include *CTMFile* and *Alexandria*.

#### Oracles for Sustainability Data {#oracles-for-sustainability-data}

Intersection with finance and Real World Data.

A data oracle is the concept of a source of real-world data which can be ingested through an application programming interface (API) by, for example, a blockchain system. There are many databases of sustainability information which could serve as an oracle for “green filter”, including carbon labeling, packaging, transportation, consumption, and waste.

-   Ethereum (2023)

-   Caldarelli, Rossignoli and Zardini (2020) notes it’s a challenge to ensure the accuracy and trustworthiness of real-world data from Oracles.

-   Brady Dale (2021) and Chainlink (2022): The largest Oracle provider ChainLink founder Sergey Nazarov believes the collaboration of oracles and blockchains can make carbon credits more trustworthy.

#### *Design Implications:* {#design-implications-2}

-   Make open data easy to use in everyday life.

-   The key idea is making CO2 Visible.

#### Emissions {#emissions}

Data about green house gas emissions.

Crippa et al. (2022) shows average global emissions are 4.81 tonnes of CO2 per capita.

| Per Capita (2020)    | Total (2021)   |
|----------------------|----------------|
| Qatar                | China          |
| Kuwait               | U.S.A          |
| Bahrain              | European Union |
| United Arab Emirates | India          |
| Brunei Darussalam    | Russia         |
|                      | Japan          |
|                      | Iran           |
|                      | South Korea    |
|                      | Indonesia      |
|                      | Saudi Arabia   |

World Resources Institute (2020) shows the top 5 largest per capita CO2 emissions come from Oil Producers. Total CO2 emissions from European Commission. Joint Research Centre. (2022).

Ivanova et al. (2020) shows the average per capita carbon footprint of North America 13.4, Europe 7.5, Africa and the Middle East 1.7 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per capita.

#### Carbon Labels {#carbon-labels}

Adding CO2 labels for consumer products have been discussed for decades (Adam Corner (2012)). Cohen and Vandenbergh (2012) argues carbon labels do influence consumer choice towards sustainability. Academic literature has looked at even minute detail such as color and positioning of the label (Zhou et al. (2019)). There is some indication consumers are willing to pay a small premium for low-CO2 products (Xu and Lin (2022)). All else being equal, consumers choose the option with a lower CO2 number (Carlsson, Kataria and Lampi (2022)). Nonetheless, the idea of *Carbon Labelling* is yet to find mainstream adoption.

There’s some evidence to suggest labeling low CO2 food enables people to choose a *climatarian diet* in a large-scale study Lohmann et al. (2022) of UK university students, however the impact of carbon labels on the market share of low-carbon meals is negligible. Labels alone are not enough. underlines Edenbrandt and Lagerkvist (2022) in Sweden in a study which found a negative correlation between worrying about climate impact and interest in climate information on products, suggesting a need for wider environmental education programs. Asioli et al. (2022) found differences between countries, where Spanish and British consumers chose meat products with *‘No antibiotics ever’* over a *Carbon Trust* label, whereas French consumers chose CO2 labeled meat products.

Brian Kateman (2020): Carbon labeling is voluntary and practiced by only a handful of companies. The U.S. restaurant chain *Just Salad* , U.K.-based vegan meat-alternative *Quorn* and plant milk *Oatly* provide carbon labeling on their products. ClimatePartner (2020): Companies like ClimatePartner and Carbon Calories offers labeling consumer goods with emission data as a service. The Carbon Trust (n.d.): The Carbon Trust reports it’s certified 27 thousand product footprints.

-   55% of emissions come from energy production.

-   Carto (2023) Making advanced maps to convince people to make changes

#### Digital Product Passports {#digital-product-passports}

It’s a further development of the idea of carbon labels.

-   Nissinen, Seppälä and Heinonen (2022) reports The European Commision has proposed a *Digital Product Passports* to help companies transfer environmental data. Carbon labels are needed for green transformation.

-   Reich et al. (2023) “Information gaps are identified as one of the major obstacles to realizing a circular economy.”

-   Jensen et al. (2023) “support decision-making throughout product life cycles in favor of a circular economy.”

-   King, Timms and Mountney (2023) “influence consumer behavior towards sustainable purchasing and responsible product ownership by making apparent sustainability aspects of a product life cycle.”x m

-   Berger, Rusch, et al. (2023) “support Sustainable Product Management by gathering and containing product life cycle data. However, some life cycle data are considered sensitive by stakeholders, leading to a reluctance to share such data.”

-   Plociennik et al. (2022) “Digital Lifecycle Passport (DLCP) hosted on a cloud platform and can be accessed by producers, users, recyclers”

## Industry Cases {#industry-cases}

Conversations about sustainability are too general and one needs to look at the specific sustainability metrics at specific industries to be able to design for meaningful interaction.

-   There are many domain-specific research showing how varied industries can develop eco-designed products. For example, Duriez et al. (2022) shows how simply by reducing material weight it’s possible to design more sustainable transportation.

#### *Design Implications:* {#design-implications-3}

-   Focus on specific industries.

### Fashion {#fashion}

Sustainable Fashion, Textile Design

Anon. (n.d.e): Young people are the largest consumers of fast fashion. In European Environment Agency (2022), European Environment Agency (EEA) estimates based on trade and production data that EU27 citizens consumed an average 15kg of textile products per person per year.

-   Millward-Hopkins, Purnell and Baurley (2023) shows how half of the textile waste in the UK is exported to other countries.

-   Story of Patagonia Chouinard (2005)

Across industries, reports are saying there isn’t enough transparency.

-   US EPA (2016) GHG emission inventory by sector

-   **Problem**: Emily Chan (2022a) report says there’s not enough transparency in fashion:

-   Fashion greenwashing, fashion is 2%-8% of total GHG emissions, 2.4 Trillion USD industry, 100B USD lost to lack of recycling, contributes 9% of microplastics: Adamkiewicz et al. (2022)

-   Centobelli et al. (2022) per year uses 9B cubic meters of water, 1.7B tons of CO2, 92 million tons of textile waste.

### Food {#food}

-   (Santos et al., 2023): complex supply chains make seafood (marine Bivalvia, mollusks) logistics prone to fraud, leading to financial losses and threats to consumer health. The same is true for cocoa beans, which are at risk from food fraud (Fanning et al., 2023).
-   Nabipour Afrouzi et al. (2023): “The agricultural sector contributes to approximately 13.5% of the total global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and accounts for 25% of the total CO2 emission.”
-   Yap et al. (2023) Singapore disposes of 900,000 tonnes of plastic waste out of which only 4% is recycled.
-   Kiessling et al. (2023) Single-use plastics make up 44-68% of all waste mapped by citizen scientists.

There are several initiatives to reduce food waste by helping people consume food that would otherwise be throw away.

-   Poore and Nemecek (2018) suggests 26% of carbon emissions come from food production. Saner et al. (2015) reports dairy (46%) and meat and fish (29%) products making up the largest GHG emission potential. Springmann et al. (2021) proposes veganism is the most effective decision to reduce personal CO2 emissions.

-   Food Sovereignty: “The global food sovereignty movement, which had been building momentum since its grassroots conception in the late ’90s, quickly gained traction with its focus on the rights of people everywhere to access healthy and sustainable food. One of the pillars of the movement lies in using local food systems to reduce the distance between producers and consumers.”
