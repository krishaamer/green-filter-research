## Regenerative Capitalism {#regenerative-capitalism}

There are many suggestions for upgrading capitalism.

There’s no lack of books on changing capitalism.

Externalities need to be priced in.

metrics and goals: ESG, SDGs,

There’s a series of authors under the “New Economics” banner, blue
economics, Regenerative Capitalism, donut economics.

-   Is economic growth the wrong goal: @diduchEconomicGrowthWrong2020

-   Celo’s protocol invests in carbon credits on the protocl level:

### Sustainable Finance {#sustainable-finance}

-   Money connects all industries. People want to shop, save, invest
    sustainably - how to do it?

-   @ChancellorSetsOut Taxonomy of sustainable activities in the UK

-   @unepUNEPGreenFinance2022: **UNEP has identified that if the world
    is to meet its climate change, biodiversity, and land degradation
    targets, it needs to close a \$4.1 trillion financing gap in nature
    by 2050. The stakes are higher than ever, biodiversity and nature
    must be at the forefront of the COP27 climate agenda.** 

-   @GreenFinanceInstitute2023: “We can and must channel private capital
    into nature-based solutions. This will require policy and regulatory
    support, catalytic capital and financial innovation. Ahead of COP27
    in Egypt, Financing Nature: COP27 Special will showcase examples of
    where this is already happening, and discuss what we collectively
    must do to mobilize capital at scale” said Dr Rhian-Mari Thomas,
    Chief Executive Officer, GFI.

-   @RegenerativeCapitalismNew2023 “The quality of growth matters”

-   @trucostNaturalCapitalRisk2023 finds unpriced externalities (natural
    resources) 7.3 trillion USD per annum.

-   Nerdwallet’s @tommytindallFinancialActionsSpeak2023 suggests making
    financial commitments instead of resolutions.

-   How can the mobile devices which the majority of us are carrying
    with us every day, help us make decisions about the businesses we
    engage with? In terms of user experience, can personalized AI
    advisors empower our financial actions from shopping to saving and
    investing?

-   As an interaction design student who cares about the environment, I
    ask myself how can interaction design contribute to increase
    sustainability? I make the assumption that investing is inherently
    “good” for one’s life, in the same way, that doing sports is good,
    or eating healthy is good. It’s one of the human activities that is
    required for an improved quality of life as we age - and started
    investing sooner, rather than later, is best because of the compound
    interest. Nonetheless, investment also includes higher risk than
    sports or food. How to communicate the risk effectively while
    educating the users?

-   In 2022, the world population emitted 37.5 gigatonnes of CO₂, the
    highest emissions in world history, following a steady annual
    increase, according to @statistaAnnualCO2Emissions2023.

-   @WorldEconomicOutlook2023

-   In 2022 the Global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was estimated at
    around 100 Trillion USD @aarononeillGlobalGDP19852028.

-   @greensefaBeyondGrowthChangingGoal2023 we should measure wellbeing
    in addition to GDP!! We need resilency dashboards, to to visualize
    metrics beyond GDP and they are an integral part of country reports.

-   @greensefaNatureVoteSuccess2023 large corporations such as Nestle
    and Coca Cola support the biodiversity law to have a level playing
    field for business.

-   EU releases strategic foresight reports since 2020
    @europeancommissionStrategicForesight2023

-   Lack of leadership. @capgeminiWorldBalanceWhy2022: “Many business
    leaders see sustainability as costly obligation rather than
    investment in the future”.

-   Is it possible to make financial decisions that follow our
    guidelines and preferences but without moment-to-moment involvement
    needed so as to save up our precious time?

-   The key improvement of personalizing financial advice is
    understanding the user’s dynamic risk profile.

-   @capponiPersonalizedRoboAdvisingInteractive2019 argues “The client
    has a risk profile that varies with time and to which the
    robo-advisor’s investment performance criterion dynamically adapts”.

-   The combination of consumption and investment is an access point to
    get the consumer thinking about investing. Even if the amount are
    small, they are a starting point for a thought process.

## Shopping {#shopping}

### Shopping Footprint {#shopping-footprint}

-   Shop CO2e emissions for each company who i buy from? “get rid of
    brands”!! cause they hide and lie

-   Make commerce more transparent

    focus on individual actions as a solution is often misplaced, though
    it remains a focus of media and industry. For decades, the

-   Building customer loyalty is a key part of repeat business and
    financial predictability. Large consumer brands like Starbucks have
    for long ran successful rewards programs that encourage customers to
    come back.

-   @mckeoughMcKinseyDesignLaunches2018 business consultancies have
    begun to recognize the importance of design to business. They advise
    their corporate clients to bring user experience design to the core
    of their business operations.

-   @GreenFintechTrends2020 report predicts the rise of personalizing
    sustainable finance, because of its potential to grow customer
    loyalty, through improving the user experience. Similarly to good
    design, interacting with sustainable finance for the ‘green-minded’
    demographics, providing a reliable green product is a way to build
    customer loyalty.

-   @hoikkalaCEOSeesTerrible2019: meanwhile the CEO of the Swedish
    clothing producer H&M, one of the largest fast-fashion in the world,
    recognizes the potential impact of conscious consumers as a threat.

-   Success stories integrating previously distinct experiences with
    sustainability have shown positive results, for example, Alibaba’s
    Ant Forest simultaneously raising money for planting forests and
    building loyalty, leading the company to consider further avenues
    for gamification and eco-friendliness.

-   From building loyalty to building ownership, the first step is to
    start saving money to invest. How to encourage savings in daily life
    and make it a part of the everyday payments experience? Even
    starting with a small step, gathering a small target amount per
    month for savings, has the potential to shift the user’s way of
    thinking about money. The second step, choosing where to invest
    these savings, will help us begin thinking like an investor. To
    start noticing trends and looking into how finance shapes the world.

-   @fotheringhamHowCreateGreener2017: In the words of a Canadian
    investment blogger, “every dollar you spend or invest is a vote for
    the companies and their ethical and sustainability practices”.

-   Could investing as a pathway from a loyalty scheme strengthen the
    feeling of connection with the business even further? After all, I’m
    now a minority owner! What are the standard conversations about
    money and savings that I would traditionally have with a financial
    advisor, that could be converted into a portable, mobile form, in my
    pocket every day?

## Saving {#saving}

-   @burkartClimateFinanceGets2022
-   Savings and Investing are conflate into the same chapter because the
    large majority of savings that people have are invested by their
    banks. Thus the question of *sustainable savings* comes one of where
    exactly are they invested and what is the impact of that investment
    of sustainability.
-   There are two ways to look at sustainable savings and this chapter
    is going to look at both of them. 1) Savings in CO2e emissions 2)
    Savings in the financial sense of the word.
-   Assumptions: — where to put money makes a difference to
    sustainability. i.e. it matters what we buy, what we save, and where
    we invest
-   Investing is a stronger signal to business than interactions on
    social media. Design Stakeholder capitalism. In future company every
    company should get a sustainability plan. this can be a push in that
    direction if companies with a sustainability plan become more
    competitive because of higher consumer demand.
-   Hypothesis?
-   Savings are the money one has in a pension fund or managed by
    themselves. For the majority of people, savings are invested by the
    bank and make up the largest proportion on investments for the
    people who are not active investors themselves.
-   @M1FinanceReview2023
-   “Environmental savings”, “means the credit incurred by a community
    that invests in environmental protection now instead of paying more
    for corrective action in the future. If there is no way to estimate
    environmental savings for a particular project, then the amount of”

### Fintech UX {#fintech-ux}

Given the large number of fraud cases in finance, *trust* is the number
one concern for users (CITE). Good design is crucial for creating
transparency, and transparency leads to trust.

-   Like a Robinhood stock symbol page for brands including live ESG
    metrics and ability to register divestment - Same for crypto can be
    automated? - People will start to discuss ESG vs price discrepancy?

### Banks, Fintech, and Payments {#banks-fintech-and-payments}

-   While the financial industry is highly digitized, plenty of banks
    are still paper-oriented, running digital and offline processes
    simultaneously, making them slower and less competitive, than
    startups. Indeed, the new baseline for customer-facing finance is
    set by fintech, taking cues from the successful mobile apps in a
    variety of sectors, foregoing physical offices, and focusing on
    offering the best possible online experience for a specific
    financial service, such as payments. The European Central Bank
    describes fintech as improving the user experience across the board,
    making interactions more convenient, user-friendly, cheaper, and
    faster.

-   O bank carbon calculator (Brasil): “Consumer Spending Carbon
    Calculator” and “Low-Carbon Lifestyle Debit Card”

-   @TaiwanOBankLaunches2022: “access Mastercard’s big data database and
    calculates the amount of carbon emission of each transaction based
    on the type and amount of products or services purchased.”

-   “Fintech has had a more pronounced impact in the payments market
    \[…\] where the incumbents have accumulated the most glaring
    shortcomings, often resulting in inefficient and overpriced
    products,” Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB
    says in @europeancentralbankLendingPaymentSystems2019.

-   Using digital payments instead of cash enables a new class of
    experiences, in terms of personalization, and potentially, for
    sustainability. According to @mckinseyNextFrontierAsia2020, Asia has
    shown the fastest growth in payments in the world.

-   Meanwhile, in Europe, point of sales (PoS) lending is a common
    practice in Sweden, and one of the reasons for the success of
    Klarna, the Swedish banking startup, which has managed to lend money
    to more consumers than ever, through this improved user experience.
    Taking out loans for consumption is a questionable personal
    financial strategy at best. If people can loan money at the point of
    sales, why couldn’t there be 180 degrees opposite service - pointof
    sales investing?

-   @bunqBunq2020: A Dutch fintech company Bunq (fig. 5) offers payment
    cards for sustainability, provided by MasterCard, which connects
    everyday payments to green projects, such as planting trees and
    donations to charities within the same user interface.

-   Sharing a similar goal to Alibaba’s Ant Forest, Bunq’s approach
    creates a new interaction dynamic in a familiar context (card
    payments), enabling customers to effortlessly contribute to
    sustainability. However, it lacks the level of gamification which
    makes Alibaba’s offering so addictive, while also not
    differentiating between the types of purchases the consumer makes,
    in terms of the level of eco-friendliness.

```mdx-code-block
<Figure caption="Figure 5: Bunq combines banking and eco-friendly actions in the same UI" src={Bunq} />
```

-   If corporate social responsibility (CSR) loyalty programs, driven by
    points systems are useful, can we go a step further, and create a
    pathway to enable the consumer to become an investor in the company
    they like to buy from? Could this strategy provide more meaning for
    the consumer, leading to higher customer retention, as well as
    financial returns? The following popular (totaling millions of
    users) robo-advisory apps combine sustainability, personalization,
    ethics, and investing (fig. 6) - however, they are mostly only
    available on the US market:

```mdx-code-block

```

-   Financial AI companion apps have not yet grown to mainstream scale
    in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Europe, being for the moment a
    largely US-based retail investor trend. The apps outside of the US
    are niche products in a nascent stage, however, they still provide
    relevant design directions or stories of what to avoid.

    counterparts.

-   @bankinghubRoboAdvisorNew2019: While Germany has 30+ robot-advisors

    manage in the US.

-   While the financial AI companion apps in the US market are ahead
    globally, they are not yet using many of the user experience
    innovations that are prevalent on social media platforms targeted at
    Generation Z and/or Millennials, possibly presenting an opportunity
    for cross-industry knowledge transfer, from businesses that are
    traditionally closer to the consumer - such as retailers.

### Retail Investors {#retail-investors}

#### Young Investors {#young-investors}

-   @openseaTopTaiwanInfluencers2022 Taiwanese digital influencers as
    NFTs.

-   *For young people, investing mostly means buying cryptocurrencies?*

-   Koreans investing in influencers?

Banks have started offering a service to automatically save and invest
tiny amounts of money collected from shopping expenses. Every purchase
one makes contributes a small percentage - usually rounded up to the
nearest whole number - to one’s investment accounts. For example,
@swedbankEasySaver2022, the leading bank in the Estonian market, offers
a savings service where everyday payments made with one’s debit card are
rounded up to the next Euro, and this amount is transferred to a
separate savings account. Similarly, the Estonian bank
@lhvMicroinvestmentGrowthAccount2020 offers micro-investing and
micro-savings services, with an interesting user experience innovation
showing how for an average Estonian means additional savings of about
400€ per year.

-   Investing is a fundamentally hopeful act. It means I think there’s a
    future. Specifically, ‘green investing’ is investing in the future
    of our planet - but can we trust the sustainability practices the
    ‘green’ investment vehicles aggregate, promising to have a positive
    impact? For example, the European Union for many years counted
    biomass as ‘green’ energy, even while forestry companies were
    cutting down trees to produce the biomass - the regulation was not
    specific enough to curb this practice. So, in effect, a ‘green
    investor’ might be supporting deforestation. How can an easy-to-use
    investment app address such complexities without alienating the
    users?
-   The world will be very different in 30 years - it’s time to invest
    in services that make our societies resilient, able to robustly
    respond to rapid change. Research and product development go
    hand-in-hand; the outcome of this study can provide insights for new
    financial product and service development. Related to SDG 9: “Build
    resilient infrastructure, promote sustainable industrialization and
    foster innovation”. The complexity of the situation offers an
    opportunity for design to make it understandable for humans
-   In 2021 the Estonian government decided to free up mandatory
    retirement savings so people can exercise their own judgment on how
    to invest (or spend it). Financial analysts are worried the Estonian
    population will spend their retirement savings right away - instead
    of investing.
-   Gov launching ESG funds. Why is this important to research now?
    People in their twenties should invest in their future. Millennials
    and younger generations like services with a green, eco-conscious
    focus.
-   Which investment vehicles are the most suitable for green
    investments? When a person wants to make a sustainable investment,
    where to put your money if you want to make the world greener? If
    young people are worried about climate, why are they not investing
    in green assets? To what extent can interaction design increase
    market participants’ engagement with sustainability? What are some
    suitable user interfaces for millennial green investors? Is design
    relevant to investing decisions? Direct investment AI assistant vs
    marketplace of existing investment products? But how to measure?
-   Where to invest for green impact?
-   Airbnb for Investments platform for projects linked to your
    consumption habits. Can provide better products for you as well as
    invest in these companies. The consumer can feel closer connection
    to the businesses they interact with through shared values, leads to
    participatory design and stakeholder capitalism. Platform to
    understand investment products. Green crowdfunding already allows
    people to invest into projects to make new green products, for
    example from recycled materials. but what about getting involved on
    a deeper level. Bigger than projects, scalable solutions.
    Kickstarter has green projects section. Startups vs large
    businesses. The design of the user interface helps the adoption of a
    new technology. What is the suitable user interface for millennial
    green investors?
-   Currently, there is no easy way to do it, and the UX of traditional
    banks is too cumbersome and old-fashioned.

    analysis found those goals are weak”

-   @priscilaazevedorochaGreenwashingEnters222022 suggests “So far, most
    ESG investing is in the stock market. But the the \$22 trillion
    corporate bond market, where mature global companies such as Chanel
    go to borrow money from investors, has a particularly powerful role
    to play. Companies rely on debt much more than they do on stocks.”

    financial inclusion and responsible financial management. However,
    the paper further suggests that current robo-advisors (available in
    Singapore) make the investor captive to the agency of AI, making the
    person lose agency over their financial decisions.

### Sustainable Investing {#sustainable-investing}

#### Legislation {#legislation}

-   @pwc2022GrowthOpportunity2020 Changes to laws and regulations aimed
    at achieving climate change mitigation is a key driver behind the
    wave of ESG adoption. The goal of these laws, first adopted in the
    European Union, a self-proclaimed leader in eco-friendliness, is to
    pressure unsustainable companies to change towards greener
    practices, in fear of losing their access to future capital, and to
    create a mechanism forcing entire environmentally non-compliant
    business sectors to innovate towards sustainability unless they want
    to suffer from financial penalties. On the flip side of this stick
    and carrot fiscal strategy, ESG-compliant companies will have
    incentives to access to cheaper capital and larger investor demand
    from ESG-friendly investors.

-   @houseofcommonsEnvironmentalAuditSecond2002: Already in 2001, the UK
    government was discussing ways to promote sustainable investment
    “fundamental changes in VAT or corporation taxes could be used to
    promote greener consumption and investment”.

-   @europeanparliamentDirective2014652014 Directive 14 2014/65/EU,
    2014: The European Union fully recognizes the changing financial
    landscape trending towards the democratization of investments: “more
    investors have become active in the financial markets and are
    offered an even more complex wide-ranging set of services and
    instruments”.

-   @kentonMiFIDII2020: Some key legislation for investors has been put
    in place recently, for example “MiFID II is a legislative framework
    instituted by the European Union (EU) to regulate financial markets
    in the bloc and improve protections for investors”.
    @europeansecuritiesandmarketsauthorityMiFIDII2017: “MiFID II and
    MiFIR will ensure fairer, safer and more efficient markets and
    facilitate greater transparency for all participants”.

-   @quinsonTrumpPlanBlock2020 While the larger trend is for governments
    to adapt to and work towards their environmental climate commitments
    and public demand, the sovereign risk remains an issue. For example,
    the policies supported by U.S. President Trump during his presidency
    ran counter to many sustainability recommendations, including those
    directed at the financial markets. Helping legacy industries stay
    competitive for longer through subsidies, and lack of regulation, or
    even regulation supporting legacy technologies.

There’s literature suggesting it’s possible to make investments that
both make an attractive financial return and adhere to sustainability
goals. In housing development, there’s evidence of ‘green’ buildings
achieving a ‘higher financial return than conventional buildings, both
in terms of rent and sale price’ (@oyedokunGreenPremiumDriver2017).
There’s also a trend of investors looking for sustainability in addition
to profits in a few countries.

-   For example - In Sweden “Preferences for sustainable and responsible
    equity funds

-   @lagerkvistPreferencesSustainableResponsible2020 undertook a choice
    experiment with Swedish private investors.

-   @smithChinaUltraElite2019 suggests 74% of Chinese youth are looking
    for “positive impact”.

-   @lingeswaranLevellingShatteringMyths2019 suggest philanthropy is on

    are not sure how to separate sustainable assets from less
    sustainable ones.

### ESG {#esg}

-   Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG)

-   Since the 1970s, international bodies, governments, and private
    corporations have developed sustainability measurement metrics, the
    prominent one being ESG (Environmental, Social, and Corporate
    Governance) developed by the UN in 2005. This rating system has
    already been implemented or is in the process of being adopted on
    stock markets all over the world and has implications beyond the
    stock markets, allowing analysts to measure companies’ performance
    on the triple bottom line: the financial, social, and environmental
    metrics.

-   The Taipei stock market in Taiwan has listed ESG stocks since 2017
    and was hailed by Bloomberg as a regional leader in ESG reporting
    (@grauerTaiwanLeadingWay2017), while Nasdaq Nordic introduced an ESG
    index in 2018, and Euronext, the largest stock market in Europe,
    introduced an ESG index and a series of derivative instruments in
    the summer of 2020 (@euronextEuronextLaunchesSuite2020).

-   @doornStocksThatShould2020: Many ecologically focused funds with
    different approaches have been launched in recent years, with
    variations in asset mix and style of management. Thematic asset
    management is expected to grow, with investors packaging
    opportunities based on consumer trends.

-   @kirakosianLOIMLaunchesCircular2020 Digital payments and circular
    bio-economy, even using tactics such as co-branding with famous
    individuals.

-   @jerseyeveningpostCharlesAchievingSustainable2020 A recent example
    is one of the largest private banks in Switzerland, Lombard Odier &
    Co, when they launched a thematic bio-economy fund inspired by the
    words of The Prince of Wales, ‘Building a sustainable future is, in
    fact, the growth story of our time’.

-   @reidUniversityEdinburghGoes2020 ESG gives banks a new tool to
    market and sell environmentally conscious opportunities to
    institutional investors, for example, universities - a case in point
    being the recent partnership between HSBC and the University of
    Edinburgh.

-   @pwc2022GrowthOpportunity2020 PWC suggests “asset managers educate
    their staff and client base. ‘It will be critical to build stronger
    ESG expertise among their employees by up-skilling existing staff on
    ESG principles and strategically scout for and integrate more
    diverse and ESG-trained talent’”.

-   The advice consultancies are providing to banks establishes a common
    language and helps banks to sell strategical alignment for long-term
    institutional sustainability in terms of finance, social, and
    governance.

-   For AI-powered assistants to be able to provide guidance, metrics
    are needed to evaluate sustainable assets, and ESG provides the
    current state-of-the-art for this. The largest obstacle to
    eco-friendly investing is greenwashing where companies and
    governments try to portray an asset as green when in reality it’s
    not. A personal investing assistant can provide an interface to
    focus on transparency, highlighting data sources and limitations, to
    help users feel in control of their investment decisions, and
    potentially even provide large-scale consumer feedback on negative
    practices back to the business through infringement discovery.

#### ESG Investing {#esg-investing}

-   My research aims to find ways to enable a wider audience to access
    sustainable investment opportunities. This chapter gives an overview
    of the current (as of late 2020) sustainable investing landscape as
    well as future trends related to interaction design and user
    experience innovations (fig. 4).

-   This research is concerned with how billions of people might exclude
    polluting companies from their lives and elect to support companies
    that put sustainability in the core of their business instead. Why
    does it matter? Individual sacrifice is too small to have a
    meaningful impact. For societal change, we need to pool our
    resources.

-   **How can ESG (environment, social, and governance) become
    accessible to our everyday experience, while avoiding
    greenwashing?**

-   Given our combined power (I’m a Millennial) with Generation Z, we
    are willing to pay more for sustainable products \[^8\].

-   In institutional finance, the Norwegian \$1.3T USD sovereign wealth
    fund (the world’s largest, followed by China)\[^5\] started a
    divestment trend in 2016 by divesting from coal. Their plan to reach
    net zero CO2e nonetheless only targets 2050. Furthermore, who would
    be the counterpart for such large transactions? The fund also
    announced divesting from Russia after its invasion of Ukraine,
    however has yet to sell any shares citing lack of buyers on the
    Moscow stock market. University of California also followed suit
    with divestment of its \$126B USD portfolio from oil and gas.

-   Other large university endowments, such as managed by Yale, Stanford
    and MIT are in decision gridlock\[^6\]. Blackrock, the largest
    private investment fund in the world with \$10T USD under
    management, released guidance reflecting their plans to shift their
    investments to vehicles that are measured on Environmental, Social,
    and Governance (ESG) performance \[^7\]. However they later
    backtracked from their decision.

-   Banks are required by law to apply the principle of Know Your
    Customer (KYC).

-   How could people apply the same principle (Know Your Company) when
    buying a product or investing? Would building an ESG community help
    push polluting companies towards greener practices? - or starving
    them from cheap access to capital.

-   It can be as mundane as choosing the next eco-friendly product
    instead of the polluting one we purchase in the supermarket make a
    difference? How to invest in the growth of companies that put ESG at
    the center of their activities instead of using it for greenwashing?

    ESG Not delivering on it’s hopes

-   @tedxtalksDisruptiveNewModel2022 large corporations are using ESG
    for greenwashing by investing in token-projects but not changing
    their fundamental polluting practices.

| ESG is an annual report not realtime |     |     |

**Design Implications:**

-   ESG alone is not a sufficient metric to prove sustainability of a
    company and needs to be accompanied by other metrics.

#### Realtime ESG {#realtime-esg}

There’s a growing number of companies helping businesses to measure CO2e
emissions in their product lifecycle.

-   @kylewiggersMakersiteLands18M2022 proposes makersite, instant
    sustainability impact from supply chain.

-   @makersiteImproveYourProduct proposes ***product sustainability
    modeling***.

-   @timnicolleRealtimeESGData “Real-time ESG data is more difficult to
    greenwash”, “supply chain is a significant source of ESG content”

-   Automate CO2 calculations realtime:

-   @indrekkaldEestiITfirmaAutomatiseeris2022: FlowIT automate CO2
    counting

-   “Factory social score”.

-   People working at the factories can report conditions

-   @ESGAnalyticsRealtime: “But the real breakthrough is how we can
    surface that real-time ESG data directly to individuals in the shops
    and online, linked to the products that they are browsing and
    potentially buying. This means that ESG change will finally be
    driven by the ultimate judge of business success – the customer.”

## Greenwashing {#greenwashing}

-   @quatriniChallengesOpportunitiesScale2021 sustainability assessments
    are complex and may give flawed results.

-   Amsterdam Circular Economy Monitor
    @gemeenteamsterdamCircularEconomyMonitor2022

-   @caoImpactLoweringCarbon2023 CO2 emission reduction has a postive
    effect on corporate morale.

-   Greenwashing is a large detractor from environmental action as it’s
    difficult to know what is sustainable and what is not.

-   Upcoming EU greenwashing legislation hopes to curb misleading
    communications by companies.

-   @AntiESGCrusadeUS2023 several US states are introducing regulation
    for ESGs to curb greenwashing.

-   Green investing only makes sense if it’s possible to distinguish
    sustainable investments from not sustainable ones.

-   <s>Reading EU Commission’s proposals, one might think the
    politicians have everything under control, we can relax and continue
    the same lifestyles as before. Unfortunately, this is not true. As
    with ESG, while the good intentions may be there, the reality is
    emissions keep rising, while they should be falling. It’s possible
    to curb greenwashing!</s>

-   @sahotaAIAnalysis8002021: “thanks to other emerging technology like
    IoT sensors (to collect ESG data) and blockchain (to track
    transactions), we have the infrastructure to collect more data,
    particularly for machine consumption. By measuring real-time energy
    usage, transportation routes, manufacturing waste, and so forth, we
    have more quantifiable ways to track corporations’ environmental
    performance without relying purely on what they say.”

    ClimateBert AI finds rampant greenwashing

-   @chenxiyuHowAICan2021 ESG is filled with greenwashing.

-   @ussecuritiesandexchangecommissionOfficeHoursGary2022: In the USA:
    *“If it’s easy to tell if milk is fat-free by just looking at the
    nutrition label, it might be time to make it easier to tell
    if”green” or “sustainable” funds are really what they say they
    are.”* says Gary Gensler, head of U.S. Securities and Exchange
    Commission.

-   @francesschwartzkopffEUExploresTighter2022 suggests the ESMA and EU
    has strengthened legislation to counter ESG greenwashing.

-   Sustainability is fragmented. How can billions of people find
    greener alternatives and build closer relationships with
    sustainability-focused companies? Greenwashing is widespread, how
    can we feel trust, honesty, and transparency? A research project for
    designing a sustainable shopping, savings, and investing companion.

-   Laws against greenwashing

-   @ussecuritiesandexchangecommissionOfficeHoursGary2022 Both the
    European Commission and the Chair of U.S. Securities and Exchange
    Commission (SEC) Gary Gensler have called for more legislation to
    curb business greenwashing practices.

-   @andreVoluntaryCarbonNeutral2022: Until new legislation is in place
    (2030 in the EU), consumer awareness is crucial as currently most
    emission-reduction programs are voluntary and thus affected by
    consumer demand. @geoffreysupranThreeShadesGreen2022 Greenwashing is
    widespread in company social media communications.

-   @purkissBigCompostExperiment2022 highlights the confusion between
    compostable and biodegradable plastics and public misunderstanding
    what happens to these plastics when they reach the landfill. For
    example, “Most plastics marketed as”home compostable” don’t actually
    work, with as much as 60% failing to disintegrate after six months”.

-   @napperEnvironmentalDeteriorationBiodegradable2019: Shopping bags
    marketed as *biodegradable* don’t show deterioration after 3 years
    in salt-water sea environment ..

-   @fredericsimonCommissionFireIncluding2020 and
    @kirataylorEUPlanPuts2021: While the EU has proposed legislation to
    curb greenwashing, EU climate policy itself has been criticized for
    greenwashing. Sometimes greenwashing comes under legislative
    protection.

-   @boothBurningCarbonSink2022 describe how “A recent investigation
    shows illegal logging of protected areas in eastern European
    countries that supplies residential wood pellets in Italy. Belgium,
    Denmark, and the Netherlands are importing pellets from Estonia,
    where protected areas are logged for pellets and the country has
    lost its forest carbon sink, despite large-scale wood pellet plants
    being certified ‘sustainable’ by the Sustainable Biomass Program”. A
    number of new AI-based tools aim to find instances of greenwashing.

-   @ClimateBondsInitiative2022: Climate Bonds Initiative greening the
    \$55 trillion short-term debt market

-   **Design Implications:** *As a consumer, I can get notified by the
    app about highlights of poor legislation refuted by science*.

## Summary {#summary}

-   @10YearsGreen2019: “Investors want to know where their money is
    going”, says Heike Reichelt, Head of Investor Relations at World
    Bank.
-   This applies to both institutional and increasingly retail
    investors. Sustainable investing is possible due to consumer demand
    for greener products and services, and new tools such as ESG for
    measuring sustainable businesses and assets, as well as advancements
    in large-scale computational technologies to analyze large amounts
    of tracking data, comparing performance between different assets.
    Given these developments, might it be possible to create a practical
    sustainable investing AI advisor for consumers?
