# Design for Sustainability {#design-for-sustainability}

AI can help us make sense of the vast amounts of sustainability data generated daily.

-   Gupta et al. (2023) argues software is key to building more sustainable products, already for decades. More recently, companies like AutoDesk are putting CO2 calculations inside their design software. “Sustainability starts in the design process, and AI can help” “Sustainability Starts in the Design Process, and AI Can Help” (n.d.)

-   https://medium.com/ideas-at-igenius/lets-talk-about-sustainable-ai-d4ae4650493e

-   “Carbon pricing is not there to punish people.”

-   “It’s there to remind us, when we take travel, heating, consumption decisions that the true cost of fossil fuels comprises not only mining and processing, but also the damage done by the CO2 they release.”

-   Very simple.” Lion Hirth Lion Hirth (n.d.)

-   The EU has a ***taxonomy of environmentally sustainable economic activities*** published by the Technical Expert Group (TEG) on sustainable finance *EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities* (n.d.).

-   Chapman (2009) argues in his seminal paper (and later in his book) for “Emotionally Durable Design”, the simple idea that we hold to things we value and thus they are sustainable. We don’t throw away a necklace gifted to us by mom, indeed this object might be passed down for centuries.

-   Rose (2015) has a similar idea, where “Enchanted Objects” become so interlinked with us, we’re unlikely to throw them away.

## Provenance and Traceability {#provenance-and-traceability}

-   Ethereum blockchain and animal rights. “Blockchain can provide a transparent, immutable record of the provenance of products. This can be especially useful for verifying claims made about animal welfare. For example, products claiming to be”free-range,” “organic,” or “sustainably sourced” could have their entire lifecycle recorded on the blockchain, from birth to shelf, allowing consumers to verify these claims.”

## Oracles for Sustainability Data {#oracles-for-sustainability-data}

A data oracle is the concept of a source of real-world data which can be ingested through an API by, for example, a blockchain system. There are many databases of sustainability information which could serve as an oracle for “green filter”, including carbon labeling, packaging, transportation, consumption, waste, etc.

## Quantified Self {#quantified-self}

There is a lot of research on quantified self. the Wearable devices like Apple Watch, Oura Ring and apps help users track a variety of health metrics. Can we also track personal sustainability in a similar fashion?

-   Delclòs-Alió et al. (2022) discusses walking in Latin American cities. Walkin is the most sustainable method or transport but requires the availability of city infrastructure, such as sidewalks, which many cities still lack.

## What is Sustainability? {#what-is-sustainability}

*Sustainability* was first mentioned in 1713 by *Hans Carl von Carlowitz* in the context of forestry in his seminal book (Hannß Carl von Carlowitz (1713)) discussing sustainable forest management, today known as *sustainable yield* of *natural capital* required to maintain *ecosystem services* (Peter Kareiva et al. (2011)). Contemporary studies have shown *biodiversity* as one key factor to maintain delivery of ecosystem services (Le Provost et al. (2022)).

Keeble (1988) reported in April 1987 (a few months after I was born) that *‘residents in high-income countries lead lifestyles incompatible with planetary boundaries’*. While my home Estonia at the time was considered low-income, a small nation on the verge of poverty behind the Iron Curtain occupation of the Soviet Occupy, we now in 2023, have indeed reached high-income status.

Moberg et al. (2019) reports daily human activities emission contribution on average in France, Germany, Norway and Sweden:

| Emission Share | Category |
|----------------|----------|
| 21%            | Housing  |
| 30%            | Food     |
| 34%            | Mobility |
| 15%            | Other    |

## Design for Sustainability {#design-for-sustainability-1}

***Designing for Sustainability*** encompasses all human activities, making this pursuit an over-arching challenge across all industries. Assuming that as individuals we want to act in a sustainable way, how exactly would be go about doing that?

-   IEA (2022) reports “Global CO2 emissions from energy combustion and industrial processes rebounded in 2021 to reach their highest ever annual level. A 6% increase from 2020 pushed emissions to 36.3 gigatonnes”

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[0] }} />

-   Crippa et al. (2022) reports latest figures from the EU’s Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR)

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[1] }} />

-   Growing public understanding of how nature works and intersects with our use of money.

### Clean Air {#clean-air}

### Housing {#housing}

-   Debnath et al. (2022)

### Carbon Labeling {#carbon-labeling-1}

Carbon labeling is voluntary and practiced by only a handful of companies. The U.S. restaurant chain *Just Salad* , U.K.-based vegan meat-alternative *Quorn* and plant milk *Oatly* provide carbon labeling on their products (Brian Kateman (2020)). Companies like ClimatePartner and Carbon Calories offers labeling consumer goods with emission data as a service (ibid; ClimatePartner (2020)). The Carbon Trust reports it’s certified 27 thousand product footprints (The Carbon Trust (n.d.)).

-   The top 5 largest per capita CO2 emissions come from Oil Producers - Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, Brunei Darussalam (World Resources Institute (2020))

-   file:///Users/krishaamer/Downloads/CO2_emissions_of_all_world_countries_2022_report%20(1).pdf

-   https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/report_2022?vis=tot#emissions_table

-   55% of emissions come from energy production.

-   According to one study, only 37% percent of U.S. Gen-Z and Millenials follow news related to environmental issues (American Press Institute (2022))

### Population {#population}

-   In November 2022, Planet Earth’s population reached 8 Billion people (The Economic Times (2022)); future population projections predict 8.5B people by 2030 and 9.7B by 2050 (United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2022)). While population growth puts higher pressure on Earth’s resources, some research shows the effect is more from wasteful lifestyles than the raw number of people (FIND CITATION).

### Overconsumption, Climate Change, Pollution {#overconsumption-climate-change-pollution}

-   In a large scale study on Meta’s Facebook (n=108946), “Respondents in Spain (65%), Sweden (61%), and Taiwan (60%) are the most likely to say that climate change is mostly caused by human activities” (Anthony Leiserowitz et al. (2022))
-   Overconsumption is one of the root causes of climate change and marine plastic pollution.
-   Ford et al. (2022) and Lavers et al. (2022) suggest strong linkage of climate change and marine plastic pollution “along with other stressors that threaten the resilience of species and habitats sensitive to both climate change and plastic pollution”.

### Fossil Fuels and Energy {#fossil-fuels-and-energy}

There’s evidence from several countries suggesting moving to renewal energy brings benefits:

-   Amin et al. (2022) suggests “removing fossil fuel subsidies and intra-sectoral electricity price distortions coupled with carbon taxes provides the highest benefits” for both the economy and the environment in Bangladesh.

-   Considerable uncertainty exists among experts which CO2 reduction methods among nature-based and technology-based are the most effective (Low et al. (2022))

-   Luo et al. (2022) suggests using reinforcement learning to reduce energy use in cooling systems.

### Emission Scopes {#emission-scopes}

-   The U.S. National Public Utilities Council (NPUC) utility decarbonization report (National Public Utilities Council (2022)) provides a useful categorization of company emissions:

| Scope   | Source                         |
|---------|--------------------------------|
| Scope 1 | Direct emissions               |
| Scope 2 | Indirect electricity emissions |
| Scope 3 | Value chain emissions          |

## Design for Human Rights {#design-for-human-rights}

– GOP27 text refers to “human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment” (UNFCCC Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA) (2022))

### Greenwashing {#greenwashing}

Both the European Commission and the Chair of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Gary Gensler have called for more legislation to curb business greenwashing practices (US Securities and Exchange Commission (2022)). Until new legislation is in place (2030 in the EU), consumer awareness is crucial as currently most emission-reduction programs are voluntary (André & Valenciano-Salazar (2022)) and thus affected by consumer demand.

Greenwashing is a large detractor from environmental action as it’s difficult to know what is sustainable and what is not. Reading EU Commission’s proposals, one might think the politicians have everything under control, we can relax and continue the same lifestyles as before. Unfortunately, this is not true. As with ESG, while the good intentions may be there, the reality is emissions keep rising, while they should be falling. It’s possible to curb greenwashing!

Examples of greenwashing: - Greenwashing is widespread in company social media communications Geoffrey Supran (2022) - “Most plastics marketed as”home compostable” don’t actually work, with as much as 60% failing to disintegrate after six months” Purkiss et al. (2022) - Shopping bags marketed as *biodegradable* don’t show deterioration after 3 years in salt-water sea environment Napper & Thompson (2019) - While the EU has proposed legislation to curb greenwashing, EU climate policy itself has been critized for greenwashing (Frédéric Simon (2020); Kira Taylor (2021)) - Sometimes greenwashing comes under legislative protection: “A recent investigation shows illegal logging of protected areas in eastern European countries that supplies residential wood pellets in Italy. Belgium, Denmark, and the Netherlands are importing pellets from Estonia, where protected areas are logged for pellets and the country has lost its forest carbon sink, despite large-scale wood pellet plants being certified ‘sustainable’ by the Sustainable Biomass Program” (Booth (2022))

A number of new AI-based tools aim to find instances of greenwashing.

### Carbon Markets {#carbon-markets}

-   “The Emissions Gap Report (EGR) 2021: The Heat Is On shows that new national climate pledges combined with other mitigation measures put the world on track for a global temperature rise of 2.7°C by the end of the century. That is well above the goals of the Paris climate agreement and would lead to catastrophic changes in the Earth’s climate. To keep global warming below 1.5°C this century, the aspirational goal of the Paris Agreement, the world needs to halve annual greenhouse gas emissions in the next eight years.

-   “If implemented effectively, net-zero emissions pledges could limit warming to 2.2°C, closer to the well-below 2°C goal of the Paris Agreement. However, many national climate plans delay action until after 2030. The reduction of methane emissions from the fossil fuel, waste and agriculture sectors could help close the emissions gap and reduce warming in the short term, the report finds. Carbon markets could also help slash emissions. But that would only happen if rules are clearly defined and target actual reductions in emissions, while being supported by arrangements to track progress and provide transparency.” (United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) (2021))

-   “The (Social Cost of Carbon) SCC measures the additional damage caused by an extra unit of emissions” (Kornek et al. (2021); Zhen et al. (2018)) with variations between countries (Tol (2019)) and regions (Y. Wang et al. (2022)).

-   Stern (2022) reports carbon-neutral economy needs higher CO2 prices.

-   Howard et al. (2017) argues Oceans play crucial role in carbon capture.

-   Ritz (2022) says Carbon prices are highly asymmetric.

-   Lin et al. (2022) says, apart from CO2, reduction of other atmospheric pollutants, such as non-CO2 greenhouse gases (GHGs) and short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) is required for climate stability.

-   As shown in the Phillipines by Cheng & Han (2022), with increasing extreme weather events, “businesses are more likely to emerge in areas where infrastructure is resilient to climate hazards”

-   Jerrett et al. (2022) says, In California, “Wildfires are the second most important source of emissions in 2020” and “Wildfires in 2020 negate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from other sectors.”

-   Quantifying climate damage (T.-P. Wang & Teng (2022)) proposes scenarios of climate damage

### Ecosystem Services {#ecosystem-services}

-   Bousfield et al. (2022) reports there’s evidence paying landowners for the ecosystem services their forests provide may reduce deforestation. In Estonia, startups Arbonic and Single.Earth are trialing this approach in several forests.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[3] }} />

-   Han & Chen (2022) identifies nature-based solutions “land re-naturalization (such as afforestation and wetland restoration)”

-   Noriega et al. (2018) attempts to quantify the ecosystem services (ES) provided by insects. While it can be assumed much of the flora and fauna are crucial for Earth’s systems, science is still in the process of understanding and quantifying its contributions. Meanwhile the destruction pressure on ecosystems is rapidly increasing (cite A B C).

### Biodiversity {#biodiversity-1}

-   Almond, R.E.A. et al. (n.d.) reports, the number of species killed, mass destruction of nature. “69% decline in the relative abundance of monitored wildlife populations around the world between 1970 and 2018. Latin America shows the greatest regional decline in average population abundance (94%), while freshwater species populations have seen the greatest overall global decline (83%).”

-   **The Convention on Biodiversity 2022 (COP15) adopted the first global biodiversity framework to accompany climate goals (*ADD CITATION*).**

### Air Pollution {#air-pollution}

-   Grounbreaking research by Lim et al. (2022) analyzed over 400000 individuals in England, South Korea and Taiwan establishes exposure to 2.5μm PM (PM2.5) air pollution as a cause for lung cancer. Bouscasse et al. (2022) finds strong health and economic benefits across the board from air pollution reduction in France.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[4] }} />

-   In Hannah Devlin (2022), prof Tony Mok, of the Chinese University of Hong Kong: “We have known about the link between pollution and lung cancer for a long time, and we now have a possible explanation for it. As consumption of fossil fuels goes hand in hand with pollution and carbon emissions, we have a strong mandate for tackling these issues – for both environmental and health reasons.”

**Design Implications**: *People live in the polluted areas are so used to it. What app to wake them up? “You live in a highly polluted area. Here’s the TOP 10 companies causing pollution. Here’s what you can do.”*

## Supply Chains {#supply-chains}

Several startups are using distributed ledgers (blockchains) to track source material to the factories ad product movements from factories to markets. While blockchains enable securely tracing data, which is immutable (no possible to change the same record, only update data in new records), the system still relies on correct data input. As the saying goes, “garbage in, garbage out”. Indeed, the blockchain is most useful for auditing, as the time and place of data input can be guaranteed, it will be easier to conduct a search on who inputted incorrect data.

The blockchain supply chain companies as of October 2022 include:

-   I’m interested in the concept of a “social object” https://medium.com/we-research-and-expriment-with-how-the-sharing/what-is-a-social-object-8dd52df0f15c and how the design can connect people to sustainable outcomes while shopping and investing. Perhaps even forming a community of sustainable action. What I showed in class looks like an app but it could also be a physical object (a speculative design). From the presentations I saw most students seemed to be interested in form and light (many lamps) and a couple were about medical uses. I don’t remember seeing one that could be compatible with the environmental sustainability focus unfortunately…

### Interface Studies {#interface-studies}

-   David Hoang (2022), the head of product design at Webflow, suggests taking cues from art studies to ***isolate the core problem***. “An art study is any action done with the intention of learning about the subject you want to draw”. As a former art student, Hoang looks at an interface as *“a piece of design is an artwork with function”*.

### Speculative Design {#speculative-design}

-   Dunne & Raby (2013) invented the term *‘speculative design’* in their seminal book as the question on the intersection of user experience design and speculation. Speculative design makes use of future scenarios to envision contexts and interactions in future use. Phil Balagtas, founder of The Design Futures Initiative at McKinsey, discusses the value of building future scenarios at his talk at Google (Google Design, 2019). One of his examples, the Apple Knowledge Navigator, from an Apple vision video in 1987, took two decades to materialize in the real world, inspired by a similar device first shown in a 1970s episode of Star Trek as a magic device (a term from participatory design), which then inspired subsequent consumer product development - and then another 2 decades, until the launch of the iPhone in 2007 - a total of 40 years!

-   In my “green filter” AI advisor app’s scenario, the AI is scanning for opportunities matching the user’s sustainable investment appetite and risk profile, using different methods of analysis, including alternative data sources. Traditionally, financial analysts only looked at traditional data, such as company reports, government reports, historic performance, etc., for preparing advisory guidance to their clients. With the advent of AI and big data analysis, many other options of research data have become available, for example, accurate weather predictions for agriculture can affect guidance, because of expected future weather disasters in the area. Other examples include policy predictions, pollution metrics, etc.

-   Professional financial advisors use automated tools to analyze data and present it in human form to clients. Today’s ubiquitous mobile interfaces, however, provide the opportunity to ‘cut out the middleman’ and provide similar information to clients directly, at a lower cost and a wider scale, often without human intervention. Additional (more expensive) “human-judgment- as-a-service”, a combination of robots + human input, can help provide further personalized advice for the consumer, still at a cheaper price than a dedicated human advisor. Everyone can have a financial advisor.

### “Speculative Design” for a sustainability assistant {#speculative-design-for-a-sustainability-assistant}

-   Neri Oxman’s expressions: “ecology-indifferent” “naturing”“mother naturing” “design is a practice of letting go of all that is unneccesary” “nature should be our single client”

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[5] }} />

-   Speculative design
-   Use imagination
-   Societal movements change things: implication for design: build a community
-   Processes sustain things: implication for design: built an app

### Experience Design {#experience-design}

-   In @michaelabrashInventingFuture2017 Meta Oculus AR Incubation GM Laura Fryer: “People buy experiences, not technology.”
-   Loaning terminology from service design, the user journey within an app needs to consider about touchpoint on the way to a state of success.

### Mobile App Design {#mobile-app-design}

There’s a number of user interface design patterns that have provide successful across a range of social media apps, copied from one to another, to the extent that the largest social media apps share a similar look and feature set.

-   Mobile-first

-   Provides a community for pooling money with like-minded investors

-   Social

-   Educational

-   Edutainment

-   Fun

-   Stories section like IG / app store

-   Common UI parts. Feed. Stories.  By using common UI parts from social media users have an easier time to accept the innovative parts. add Viz charts. Avatars are increasingly common and new generations are used to talking to computers.

-   Karina from Korea (aespa (2020)). It makes sense your sustainability assistant would talk to you. Studies show gen N is speaking to computers all the time. Interacting with the user is on the rise. For example, Chime makes tipping suggestions on the place of purchase.

### The Concept of ‘Nudge’ {#the-concept-of-nudge}

-   The literature on *nudge* is wide, as researches try to find ways to affect human behaviors towards sustainability. Some notable examples: - Eriksson et al. (2023) - Acuti et al. (2023) - Perez-Cueto (2021) - Wee et al. (2021) - Guath et al. (2022) - Berger et al. (2022)
-   Google and X have offered the “Green Filter” on Maps, Flights, etc. What if there was a “Green Filter” on every product everywhere?

``` mdx-code-block
<Figure caption="Google's view of flight emissions" src={FlightEmissions} refURL="https://www.google.com/travel/flights" refTitle="Copyright by Google 2023 referenced under fair use" />
```

-   One example of *nudge* are the small UI updates released by Google across its portfolio of products: Google Flights and Google maps. Google’s research introduces the concept of *digital decarbonization*, defined as “Maximising the enabling role of digital technologies by accelerating already available digital solutions” (Implement Consulting Group (2022)). Google’s Chief Sustainability Officer Kate Brandt suggests “Digital solutions play an important enabling role for at least 20-25% of the reductions required to achieve a net-zero economy in Europe” (Kate Brandt & Matt Brittin (2022)).

| №   | Product        | Nudge                                |
|-----|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1   | Google Maps    | Show routes with lower CO2 emissions |
| 2   | Google Flights | Show CO2 emissions                   |

-   Becoming a Sustainability-Aware App or Game. Jeni Miles (2022) suggests “Google recently shared its goal to help one billion people make more sustainable choices by embedding carbon emissions information into Google Flights and surfacing whether a hotel is Green Key or EarthCheck certified.”

## Conclusion {#conclusion}

-   A wide range of legislative proposals, targets, organizations, and goals already exists across Europe. Upcoming laws will harmonize approaches to sustainability and raise standards for all members countries, in turn influencing producers who wish to sell in the EU common market.

-   In unison, the reviewed technologies and practices move us closer to enabling *realtime ESG*: up-do-date transparent information about how our product are produced. Realtime ESG is necessary a building block to enable consumers and investors make more accurate, real-world purchase decisions.
