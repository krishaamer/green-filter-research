## Ecological Indicators {#ecological-indicators}

*Sustainability* was first mentioned in
\[@hannsscarlvoncarlowitzSylviculturaOeconomicaOder1713\] in the context
of forestry and discussing sustainable forest management in his seminal
book *Sylvicultura oeconomica*.

@dinersteinEcoregionBasedApproachProtecting2017 identifies 846
terrestrial ecoregions.

Sustainability can be measured using a variety of ***ecological
indicators***.

The field is known today as *sustainable yield* of *natural capital*
required to maintain *ecosystem services*
\[@peterkareivaNaturalCapitalTheory2011\].

Some argue sustainability is not enough and we should work on
regeneration of natural habitats.

Climate data visualization has a long history, starting with
***Alexander von Humboldt,*** a founder of climatology, who
revolutionized cartography by inventing the first isothermal maps around
the year 1816, showing areas with similar temperature, variations in
altitude and seasons in different colors
\[@hontonForgottenFatherClimatology2022\]. Humboldt’s isotherms are now
available as 3D computer models in \[@IsothermsSimplyEarth2023\].
Written records of global temperature measurements are available
starting from the 1880s when documentation of temperatures become
available in ship records \[@BrohanClimate2012 \].

-   Industrial revolution: @pearsonLowCarbonIndustrial2012: “transition
    to a low carbon economy presents challenges and potential economic
    benefits that are comparable to those of previous industrial
    revolutions”
-   Tragedy of the commons: @meisingerTragedyIntangibleCommons2022 and
    @lopezClimateChangeTimes2022 and @muraseSevenRulesAvoid2018

-   \[@keebleBrundtlandReportOur1988\] reported in April 1987 that
    *‘residents in high-income countries lead lifestyles incompatible
    with planetary boundaries’*. While my home Estonia at the time was
    considered low-income, a small nation on the verge of poverty behind
    the Iron Curtain occupation of the Soviet Occupy, we now in 2023,
    have indeed reached high-income status.

-   \[@korosecAmazonTaps2B2021\] reports that Amazon’s 2B USD to a
    Climate Pledge Fund earmarked to fix climate problems is invested in
    energy, logistics, and packaging startups, which will reduce
    material waste. “Good intentions don’t work, mechanisms do,”
    Amazon’s founder Bezos is quoted in \[@cliffordHowThisPopular2022\].
    It’s an example of how money marketed as climate funding by the
    retail conglomerate means focus on reducing operational cost of
    running their business through automation and material savings.

-   Aldo Leopold proposed the ideas of land ethics. “A thing is right
    when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of
    the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise.” in A
    Sand County Almanac \[@leopoldSandCountyAlmanac1972 \].

-   Ecological Indicators (I like the name Ecomarkers) for Earth are
    like Biomarkers in human health.

-   \[@sarahludwigrauschSustainabilityYourHealth2021\]: “Human health is
    central to all sustainability efforts.”, “All of these (food,
    housing, power, and health care), and the stress that the lack of
    them generate, play a huge role in our health,” Hollis says.”

-   @PublicHealthLinkages2013

-   @guidottiHealthSustainabilityIntroduction2015

-   “Sustainability is important for many reasons including:
    Environmental Quality – In order to have healthy communities, we
    need clean air, natural resources, and a nontoxic environment.”

#### *Design Implications:* {#design-implications}

-   Blood testing and biomarkers allow people to track their health. I’m
    introducing the concept of ‘eco-markers’ to follow the
    sustainability of human activities.

### Ecosystem Services {#ecosystem-services}

@historyEcosystemServices2010 the history of the valuation of nature’s
services goes back to the 18th century when David Ricardo and Jean
Baptise say discussed nature’s *work*, however both considered it should
be free. In 1997 @dailyNatureServicesSocietal1997 proposed the idea of
ecosystem services and @costanzaValueWorldEcosystem1997 attempted to
assess the amount of ecosystem services provided.

-   @MonetaryValuationNature2023 should we put a price on nature?
-   Is it time to leave utilitarian environmentalism behind?
    @muradianEcosystemServicesNature2021

-   @bousfieldCarbonPaymentsCan2022 reports there’s evidence paying
    landowners for the ecosystem services their forests provide may
    reduce deforestation.
-   @leprovostSupplyMultipleEcosystem2022 study shows *biodiversity* as
    one key factor to maintain delivery of ecosystem services.
-   @noriegaResearchTrendsEcosystem2018 attempts to quantify the
    ecosystem services (ES) provided by insects. While it can be assumed
    much of the flora and fauna are crucial for Earth’s systems, science
    is still in the process of understanding and quantifying its
    contributions.

### **Environmental Degradation** {#environmental-degradation}

#### Growing Population {#growing-population}

Earth’s population reached 8 Billion people In November 2022
\[@theeconomictimesClimateChangeEarth2022\] and population projections
by \[@unWorldPopulationProspects2022\] predict 8.5B people by 2030 and
9.7B by 2050. \[@hassounFoodProcessingCurrent2023\] forecasts increase
of global food demand by 62% including impact of climate change.

-   10 Billion people by 2050.

-   While population growth puts higher pressure on Earth’s resources,
    some research shows the effect is more from wasteful lifestyles than
    the raw number of people \[@cardinaleBiodiversityLossIts2012\]

#### Overconsumption {#overconsumption}

-   Overconsumption is one of the root causes of climate change
-   @ivanovaQuantifyingPotentialClimate2020: “Around 2/3 of global GHG
    emissions are directly and indirectly linked to household
    consumption, with a global average of about 6 tonnes CO2 equivalent
    per capita.”
-   Cities are responsible for 80% of the emissions
    @rosalescarreonUrbanEnergySystems2018
-   Overconsumption is also one of the root causes of marine plastic
    pollution. @FORD2022150392 and @laversFarDistractionPlastic2022
    suggest strong linkage of climate change and marine plastic
    pollution “along with other stressors that threaten the resilience
    of species and habitats sensitive to both climate change and plastic
    pollution”.
-   @mobergMobilityFoodHousing2019 reports daily human activities
    emission contribution on average in France, Germany, Norway and
    Sweden:

| Emission Share | Category |
|----------------|----------|
| 21%            | Housing  |
| 30%            | Food     |
| 34%            | Mobility |
| 15%            | Other    |

#### Planetary Boundaries {#planetary-boundaries}

-   As long as humanity is a mono-planetary species, we have to come to
    terms with the limitations of our home, Earth.

-   The donut is a useful visualization to be able to grasp the big
    picture, and it’s a social object that’s simple and deep at the same
    time, enabling starting conversations with people from all walks of
    life, independent of their politics leanings. As Raw calls it, it’s
    a self-portrait of humanity in the beggining of the 21st century.
    Combining the SDGs inside the donut and the Planetary Boundaries
    outside the donut. The space donut represents a state of
    equuilibrium and balance on spaceship Earth.

#### Biodiversity {#biodiversity}

-   Biodiversity loss is linked to overconsumption.

-   listening to nature, Assessing biodiversity based on species’ sounds
    in the forest Biodiversity Indicators, millions of detections of
    different species with machine learning passive acousting AI models,
    can also assess species response to climate change
    @aiforgoodListeningNatureHarnessing2023
    @guerreroAcousticAnimalIdentification2023

-   While the European Union is a leader in sustainability legislation,
    biodiversity among private companies is low
    @marco-fondevilaTrendsPrivateSector2023

-   @mayWhyShouldWe2011 argues biodiversity loss is a concern for 3
    points of views

    -   Narrowly utilitarian: biodiversity is a resource of genetic
        novelties for the biotech industry.

    -   Broadly utilitarian: humans depend upon biodiverse ecosystems.

    -   Ethical: humans have a responsibility to future generations to
        pass down a rich natural world.

-   @almondr.e.a.LivingPlanetReport reports, the number of species
    killed, mass destruction of nature. “69% decline in the relative
    abundance of monitored wildlife populations around the world between
    1970 and 2018. Latin America shows the greatest regional decline in
    average population abundance (94%), while freshwater species
    populations have seen the greatest overall global decline (83%).”

-   @wwfForestsReducingEU2022 case study highlights how 4 biodiverse
    regions Cerrado in Brazil, Chaco in Argentina, Sumatra in Indonesia,
    and the Cuvette Centrale in Democratic Republic of Congo are
    experiencing rapid destruction due to consumer demand in the
    European Union.

-   Meanwhile, there is some progress in biodiversity conservation.
    @uebtBiodiversityBarometer2022 reports “Biodiversity awareness is
    now at 72% or higher in all countries sampled, compared to only 29%
    or higher across countries sampled in 2009.”

-   @unitHistoryConvention2023: The history of the United Nations
    Convention on Biodiversity goes back to 1988, when the working group
    was founded. @unepCOP15EndsLandmark2022: The Convention on
    Biodiversity 2022 (COP15) adopted the first global biodiversity
    framework to accompany climate goals.

#### Forest {#forest}

Deforestation is widespread all around the world.

-   @fredericsimonEuropeRapidlyLosing2022 Due to deforestation, Europe
    rapidly losing its forest carbon sink.

-   Burning of biomass undermines carbon capture.

#### Water {#water}

#### Air {#air}

Air pollution is so widespread. Clean air is a requirement.

-   Grounbreaking research by @lim1MOAirPollutioninduced2022 analyzed
    over 400000 individuals in England, South Korea and Taiwan
    establishes exposure to 2.5μm PM (PM2.5) air pollution as a cause
    for lung cancer. @bouscasseDesigningLocalAir2022 finds strong health
    and economic benefits across the board from air pollution reduction
    in France.
-   In @hannahdevlinCancerBreakthroughWakeup2022, prof Tony Mok, of the
    Chinese University of Hong Kong: “We have known about the link
    between pollution and lung cancer for a long time, and we now have a
    possible explanation for it. As consumption of fossil fuels goes
    hand in hand with pollution and carbon emissions, we have a strong
    mandate for tackling these issues – for both environmental and
    health reasons.”
-   @marialuisfernandesRealityCheckIndustrial2023 EU has legislation in
    progress to curb industrial emissions.

#### *Design Implications:* {#design-implications-1}

-   *People live in the polluted areas are so used to it. What app to
    wake them up? “You live in a highly polluted area. Here’s the TOP 10
    companies causing pollution. Here’s what you can do.”*

#### Disasters and Extreme Weather {#disasters-and-extreme-weather}

Summers of 2022 and 2023 were the hottest on record so far, with extreme
heat waves recorded in places around the world

    priced at 48 yuan per tonne of CO2, averaged at 58 yuan in 2022.
-   \[@unitednationsenvironmentprogrammeunepEmissionsGapReport2021\]
    report. “The Emissions Gap Report (EGR) 2021: The Heat Is On shows
    that new national climate pledges combined with other mitigation
    measures put the world on track for a global temperature rise of
    2.7°C by the end of the century. That is well above the goals of the
    Paris climate agreement and would lead to catastrophic changes in
    the Earth’s climate. To keep global warming below 1.5°C this
    century, the aspirational goal of the Paris Agreement, the world
    needs to halve annual greenhouse gas emissions in the next eight
    years.
-   \[@unitednationsenvironmentprogrammeunepEmissionsGapReport2021\]
    report “If implemented effectively, net-zero emissions pledges could
    limit warming to 2.2°C, closer to the well-below 2°C goal of the
    Paris Agreement. However, many national climate plans delay action
    until after 2030. The reduction of methane emissions from the fossil
    fuel, waste and agriculture sectors could help close the emissions
    gap and reduce warming in the short term, the report finds. Carbon
    markets could also help slash emissions. But that would only happen
    if rules are clearly defined and target actual reductions in
    emissions, while being supported by arrangements to track progress
    and provide transparency.”

#### Fossil Fuels {#fossil-fuels}

-   \[see @ieaGlobalEnergyReview2022\] reports “Global CO2 emissions
    from energy combustion and industrial processes rebounded in 2021 to
    reach their highest ever annual level. A 6% increase from 2020
    pushed emissions to 36.3 gigatonnes”
-   @crippaCO2EmissionsAll2022 reports latest figures from the EU’s
    Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR)
-   @danielvarjoNyaSatelliterAvslojar2022: The EU Copernicus satellite
    system reveals new greenhouse emissions previously undetected
-   “Transport greenhouse gas emissions have increased every year since
    2014” @ClimateChangeMitigation2023

Fossil Fuels and Energy

There’s evidence from several countries suggesting moving to renewal
energy brings benefits:

-   @AMIN2022113224 suggests “removing fossil fuel subsidies and
    intra-sectoral electricity price distortions coupled with carbon
    taxes provides the highest benefits” for both the economy and the
    environment in Bangladesh.

-   @lowRethinkingNetZeroSystems2022 finds considerable uncertainty
    exists among experts which CO2 reduction methods among nature-based
    and technology-based are the most effective.

-   @luoControllingCommercialCooling2022 suggests using reinforcement
    learning to reduce energy use in cooling systems.

-   The true cost of products is hidden. The work is hidden.

-   Montreal protocol eradicates CfCs and te ozone holes became whole
    again.

-   @tilstedEndingFossilbasedGrowth2023 expects the fossil fuel industry
    to grow even faster.

#### Emission Scopes {#emission-scopes}

-   @nationalpublicutilitiescouncilAnnualUtilityDecarbonization2022 The
    U.S. National Public Utilities Council (NPUC) decarbonization report
    provides a useful categorization of ***emission scopes*** applicable
    to companies and useful for organizing emission reduction schemes.

| Scope   | Source                         |
|---------|--------------------------------|
| Scope 1 | Direct emissions               |
| Scope 2 | Indirect electricity emissions |
| Scope 3 | Value chain emissions          |

From @nationalpublicutilitiescouncilAnnualUtilityDecarbonization2022

For example, for consumers in Australian states and territories in 2018,
83% of the GHG emissions are Scope 3, meaning indirect emissions in the
value chain @goodwinTargetingDegreesGlobal2023

-   Mapping pollution sources in China
    @xieEcologicalCivilizationChina2021

#### Cap & Trade {#cap-trade}

-   The share of CO2 emissions among people is highly unequal across the
    world (termed ***Carbon Inequality***).
    @chancelGlobalCarbonInequality2022 reports “while one-tenth of the
    global population is responsible for nearly half of all emissions,
    half of the population emits less than 12%”.

-   One example is the ICT sector.

-   @bajarinPCSalesAre Over 300 million PCs sold in 2022

    -   @GreenDiceReinventingIdea2021 Estonian company “sustainable
        lifecycle management of IT equipment”
    -   @arilehtKestlikkuseSuunanaitajadSaadavad2022 Recycle your phone,
        FoxWay and Circular economy for PCs.
    -   @zhouCarboneconomicInequalityGlobal2022 ICT is an example of
        inequality, while emerging economies bear 82% of the emissions,
        developed countries gain 58% of value.

#### Carbon Credits {#carbon-credits}

-   In Estonia, startups Arbonic and Single.Earth are trialing this
    approach in several forests.
-   Carbon Credit Retirement?
-   Methodologies: @MethodologyGHGCoBenefits2022
-   @klimadaoOpenCallAlternative2023 call for an open standard

#### Carbon Capture {#carbon-capture}

-   @vitilloRoleCarbonCapture2022 illustrates how direct air capture of
    CO2 is difficult because of low concentration and CO2 capture at the
    source of the emissions is more feasible.

-   @gaureTrueNotTrue2022 simulate a CO2 free electricity generation
    system in the European Union where “98% of total electricity
    production is generated by wind power and solar; the remainder is
    covered by a backup technology.”. The authors stipulate it’s
    possible to power the EU without producing CO2 emissions.

-   **Important: “creating sustainability trust in companies in
    realtime”**

-   @howardPotentialIntegrateBlue2017 argues Oceans play crucial role in
    carbon capture.

#### Social Cost of Carbon {#social-cost-of-carbon}

-   @kornekSocialCostCarbon2021 and @zhenSimpleEstimateSocial2018
    suggest “The (Social Cost of Carbon) SCC measures the additional
    damage caused by an extra unit of emissions” with variations between
    countries (@tolSocialCostCarbon2019) and regions
    (@wangMeasurementChinaProvincial2022).
    @stanforduniversityProfessorsExplainSocial2021 defines the social
    cost of carbon “the cost of the damages created by one extra ton of
    carbon dioxide emissions”

-   @sternCarbonNeutralEconomy2022 reports carbon-neutral economy needs
    higher CO2 prices. @rennertComprehensiveEvidenceImplies2022: Carbon
    price should be 3,6x higher that it is currently (2022).
    @ritzGlobalCarbonPrice2022 argues optimal CO2 prices could be highly
    asymmetric, low in some countries and high (above the social cost of
    CO2) in countries where production is very polluting.

-   As shown in the Phillipines by @chengAssessingEconomicLoss2022, with
    increasing extreme weather events, “businesses are more likely to
    emerge in areas where infrastructure is resilient to climate
    hazards”. @jerrettSmokeCaliforniaGreenhouse2022 says, In California,
    “Wildfires are the second most important source of emissions in
    2020” and “Wildfires in 2020 negate reductions in greenhouse gas
    emissions from other sectors.”

-   @linOpportunitiesTackleShortlived2022 says, apart from CO2,
    reduction of other atmospheric pollutants, such as non-CO2
    greenhouse gases (GHGs) and short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs)
    is required for climate stability.

-   @tedxtalksSustainableBusinessFrank202 sustainability is filled with
    complexities, where child labor, prostitution, poverty, CO2
    emission, dangerous chemicals, and many other issues became
    intertwined.

## Eco-Design {#eco-design}

***Designing for Sustainability aka Circular Design or Eco-Design***
encompasses all human activities, making this pursuit an over-arching
challenge across all industries also known as circular economy. Assuming
that as individuals we want to act in a sustainable way, how exactly
would be go about doing that?

-   “Evolution of design for sustainability: From product design to
    design for system innovations and transitions”

    (and later in his book) for ***“Emotionally Durable Design”***, the
    simple idea that we hold to things we value and thus they are
    sustainable. We don’t throw away a necklace gifted to us by mom,
    indeed this object might be passed down for centuries.
    @roseEnchantedObjectsInnovation2015 has a similar idea, where
    ***“Enchanted Objects”*** become so interlinked with us, we’re
    unlikely to throw them away.

-   @guptaAnalysisArtificialIntelligencebased2023 argues software is key
    to building more sustainable products, already for decades. More
    recently, companies like AutoDesk are putting CO2 calculations
    inside their design software.
-   @SustainabilityStartsDesign: “Sustainability starts in the design
    process, and AI can help”.
-   @igeniusLetTalkSustainable2020
-   Very simple. “Carbon pricing is not there to punish people,” says
    Lion Hirth @lionhirthLionHirthTwitter. “It’s there to remind us,
    when we take travel, heating, consumption decisions that the true
    cost of fossil fuels comprises not only mining and processing, but
    also the damage done by the CO2 they release.”

#### *Design Implications:* {#design-implications-2}

-   AI can help us make sense of the vast amounts of sustainability data
    generated daily.

### Policy Context {#policy-context}

-   @europeanparliamentEcodesignSustainableProducts2022 proposal “On 30
    March 2022, the European Commission put forward a proposal for a

### Extended Producer Responsibility {#extended-producer-responsibility}

One type of legislation that works?

-   @steenmansFosteringCircularEconomy2023 Argues for the need to engage
    companies through legislation and shift from waste-centered laws to
    product design regulations.

-   @pengExtendedProducerResponsibility2023 finds that the Carbon
    Disclosure Project has been a crucial tool to empower ERP in Chinese
    auto-producers.

-   @liuGlobalPerspectiveEwaste2023 reports, e–waste is growing 3%–5%
    every year, globally. @thukralExploratoryStudyProducer2023
    identifies several barriers to e-waste management among producers
    including lack of awareness and infrastructure, attitudinal
    barriers, existing *informal* e-waste sector, and the need for an
    e-waste license.

-   In Europe, there’s large variance between member states when in
    comes to textile recycling: while Estonia and France are the only EU
    countries where separate collection of textiles is required by law,
    in Estonia 100% of the textiles were burned in an incinerator in
    2018 while in France textiles are covered by an Extended Producer
    Responsibility (EPR) scheme leading to higher recovery rates (Ibid).

-   @christiansenExtendedProducerResponsibility2021: Nonetheless, EPR
    schemes do not guarantee circularity and may instead be designed
    around fees to finance waste management in linear economy models.

-   @jacquesvernierExtendedProducerResponsibility2021: French EPR scheme
    was upgraded in 2020 to become more circular.

-   In any case, strong consumer legislation (such as EPR) has a direct
    influence on producers’ actions. For example, in
    @hktdcresearchFranceExpandsProducer2022@, the Hong Kong Trade
    Development Council notified textile producers in July 2022
    reminding factories to produce to French standards in order to be
    able enter the EU market.

#### *Design implications:* {#design-implications-3}

-   ERP and CDP data should be part of Green Filter.\*

### Return, Repair, Reuse {#return-repair-reuse}

-   There’s a growing number of companies providing re-use of existing
    items.
-   @SmartSwap For example, Swap furniture in Estonia

## Conclusion {#conclusion}

-   A wide range of legislative proposals, targets, organizations, and
    goals already exists across the Europepean Union. Upcoming laws will
    harmonize approaches to sustainability and raise standards for all
    members countries, in turn influencing producers who wish to sell in
    the EU common market.

-   In unison, the reviewed technologies and practices move us closer to
    enabling *realtime ESG*: up-do-date transparent information about
    how our product are produced. Realtime ESG is a building block to
    enable consumers and investors make more accurate, real-world
    purchase decisions.
