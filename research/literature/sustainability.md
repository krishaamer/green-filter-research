## Ecological Indicators {#ecological-indicators}

*Sustainability* was first mentioned in (Hannß Carl von Carlowitz, 1713) in the context of forestry and discussing sustainable forest management in his seminal book *Sylvicultura oeconomica*.

Dinerstein et al. (2017) identifies 846 terrestrial ecoregions.

Sustainability can be measured using a variety of ***ecological indicators***.

-   Svalbard Seed Vault

The field is known today as *sustainable yield* of *natural capital* required to maintain *ecosystem services* (Peter Kareiva et al., 2011).

Some argue sustainability is not enough and we should work on regeneration of natural habitats.

Climate data visualization has a long history, starting with ***Alexander von Humboldt,*** a founder of climatology, who revolutionized cartography by inventing the first isothermal maps around the year 1816, showing areas with similar temperature, variations in altitude and seasons in different colors (Honton, 2022). Humboldt’s isotherms are now available as 3D computer models in (Anon., 2023a). Written records of global temperature measurements are available starting from the 1880s when documentation of temperatures become available in ship records (Brohan et al., 2012 ).

-   Industrial revolution: Pearson and Foxon (2012): “transition to a low carbon economy presents challenges and potential economic benefits that are comparable to those of previous industrial revolutions”
-   Tragedy of the commons: Meisinger (2022) and Lopez, Pastén and Gutiérrez Cubillos (2022) and Murase and Baek (2018)

-   (Keeble, 1988) reported in April 1987 that *‘residents in high-income countries lead lifestyles incompatible with planetary boundaries’*. While my home Estonia at the time was considered low-income, a small nation on the verge of poverty behind the Iron Curtain occupation of the Soviet Occupy, we now in 2023, have indeed reached high-income status.

-   (Korosec, 2021) reports that Amazon’s 2B USD to a Climate Pledge Fund earmarked to fix climate problems is invested in energy, logistics, and packaging startups, which will reduce material waste. “Good intentions don’t work, mechanisms do,” Amazon’s founder Bezos is quoted in (Clifford, 2022). It’s an example of how money marketed as climate funding by the retail conglomerate means focus on reducing operational cost of running their business through automation and material savings.

-   Aldo Leopold proposed the ideas of land ethics. “A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise.” in A Sand County Almanac (Leopold, 1972 ).

-   Ecological Indicators (I like the name Ecomarkers) for Earth are like Biomarkers in human health.

-   (Sarah Ludwig Rausch and Neha Pathak, 2021): “Human health is central to all sustainability efforts.”, “All of these (food, housing, power, and health care), and the stress that the lack of them generate, play a huge role in our health,” Hollis says.”

-   Anon. (2013)

-   Guidotti (2015)

-   “Sustainability is important for many reasons including: Environmental Quality – In order to have healthy communities, we need clean air, natural resources, and a nontoxic environment.”

#### *Design Implications:* {#design-implications}

-   Blood testing and biomarkers allow people to track their health. I’m introducing the concept of ‘eco-markers’ to follow the sustainability of human activities.

### Ecosystem Services {#ecosystem-services}

Gómez-Baggethun et al. (2010) the history of the valuation of nature’s services goes back to the 18th century when David Ricardo and Jean Baptise say discussed nature’s *work*, however both considered it should be free. In 1997 Daily (1997) proposed the idea of ecosystem services and Costanza et al. (1997) attempted to assess the amount of ecosystem services provided.

|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Measure and assign value to nature  | Say nature is sacred, such as Churches, and can’t be touched. |

From Han and Chen (2022)

-   Bousfield et al. (2022) reports there’s evidence paying landowners for the ecosystem services their forests provide may reduce deforestation.
-   Le Provost et al. (2022) study shows *biodiversity* as one key factor to maintain delivery of ecosystem services.
-   Noriega et al. (2018) attempts to quantify the ecosystem services (ES) provided by insects. While it can be assumed much of the flora and fauna are crucial for Earth’s systems, science is still in the process of understanding and quantifying its contributions.
-   Meanwhile the destruction pressure on ecosystems is rapidly increasing (cite A B C).

### **Environmental Degradation** {#environmental-degradation}

#### Growing Population {#growing-population}

Earth’s population reached 8 Billion people In November 2022 (The Economic Times, 2022) and population projections by (United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, 2022) predict 8.5B people by 2030 and 9.7B by 2050. (Hassoun et al., 2023) forecasts increase of global food demand by 62% including impact of climate change.

-   10 Billion people by 2050.

-   While population growth puts higher pressure on Earth’s resources, some research shows the effect is more from wasteful lifestyles than the raw number of people (Cardinale et al., 2012) **???. NEED ACCESS!!**

#### Overconsumption {#overconsumption}

-   Overconsumption is one of the root causes of climate change
-   Ivanova et al. (2020): “Around 2/3 of global GHG emissions are directly and indirectly linked to household consumption, with a global average of about 6 tonnes CO2 equivalent per capita.”
-   Cities are responsible for 80% of the emissions Rosales Carreón and Worrell (2018)
-   Overconsumption is also one of the root causes of marine plastic pollution. Ford et al. (2022) and Lavers, Bond and Rolsky (2022) suggest strong linkage of climate change and marine plastic pollution “along with other stressors that threaten the resilience of species and habitats sensitive to both climate change and plastic pollution”.
-   Moberg et al. (2019) reports daily human activities emission contribution on average in France, Germany, Norway and Sweden:

| Emission Share | Category |
|----------------|----------|
| 21%            | Housing  |
| 30%            | Food     |
| 34%            | Mobility |
| 15%            | Other    |

#### Planetary Boundaries {#planetary-boundaries}

-   As long as humanity is a mono-planetary species, we have to come to terms with the limitations of our home, Earth.

-   The donut is a useful visualization to be able to grasp the big picture, and it’s a social object that’s simple and deep at the same time, enabling starting conversations with people from all walks of life, independent of their politics leanings. As Raw calls it, it’s a self-portrait of humanity in the beggining of the 21st century. Combining the SDGs inside the donut and the Planetary Boundaries outside the donut. The space donut represents a state of equuilibrium and balance on spaceship Earth.

### Earth System Law {#earth-system-law}

-   Du Toit and Kotzé (2022)

#### Biodiversity {#biodiversity}

-   Biodiversity loss is linked to overconsumption.

-   listening to nature, Assessing biodiversity based on species’ sounds in the forest Biodiversity Indicators, millions of detections of different species with machine learning passive acousting AI models, can also assess species response to climate change AI for Good (2023) Guerrero et al. (2023)

-   While the European Union is a leader in sustainability legislation, biodiversity among private companies is low Marco-Fondevila and Álvarez-Etxeberría (2023)

-   May (2011) argues biodiversity loss is a concern for 3 points of views

    -   Narrowly utilitarian: biodiversity is a resource of genetic novelties for the biotech industry.

    -   Broadly utilitarian: humans depend upon biodiverse ecosystems.

    -   Ethical: humans have a responsibility to future generations to pass down a rich natural world.

-   Almond, R.E.A. et al. (2022) reports, the number of species killed, mass destruction of nature. “69% decline in the relative abundance of monitored wildlife populations around the world between 1970 and 2018. Latin America shows the greatest regional decline in average population abundance (94%), while freshwater species populations have seen the greatest overall global decline (83%).”

-   WWF (2022) case study highlights how 4 biodiverse regions Cerrado in Brazil, Chaco in Argentina, Sumatra in Indonesia, and the Cuvette Centrale in Democratic Republic of Congo are experiencing rapid destruction due to consumer demand in the European Union.

-   Meanwhile, there is some progress in biodiversity conservation. UEBT (2022) reports “Biodiversity awareness is now at 72% or higher in all countries sampled, compared to only 29% or higher across countries sampled in 2009.”

-   Unit (2023): The history of the United Nations Convention on Biodiversity goes back to 1988, when the working group was founded. UNEP (Tue, 12/20/2022 - 07:44): The Convention on Biodiversity 2022 (COP15) adopted the first global biodiversity framework to accompany climate goals.

#### Forest {#forest}

Deforestation is widespread all around the world.

-   Frédéric Simon (2022) Due to deforestation, Europe rapidly losing its forest carbon sink.

-   Burning of biomass undermines carbon capture.

#### Water {#water}

-   Clean water and water pollution
-   Koch (2022) (**Need access!)**

#### Air {#air}

Air pollution is so widespread. Clean air is a requirement.

-   Grounbreaking research by Lim et al. (2022) analyzed over 400000 individuals in England, South Korea and Taiwan establishes exposure to 2.5μm PM (PM2.5) air pollution as a cause for lung cancer. Bouscasse et al. (2022) finds strong health and economic benefits across the board from air pollution reduction in France.
-   In Hannah Devlin (2022), prof Tony Mok, of the Chinese University of Hong Kong: “We have known about the link between pollution and lung cancer for a long time, and we now have a possible explanation for it. As consumption of fossil fuels goes hand in hand with pollution and carbon emissions, we have a strong mandate for tackling these issues – for both environmental and health reasons.”
-   MARIA LUÍS FERNANDES (2023) EU has legislation in progress to curb industrial emissions.

#### *Design Implications:* {#design-implications-1}

-   *People live in the polluted areas are so used to it. What app to wake them up? “You live in a highly polluted area. Here’s the TOP 10 companies causing pollution. Here’s what you can do.”*

#### Disasters and Extreme Weather {#disasters-and-extreme-weather}

Summers of 2022 and 2023 were the hottest on record so far, with extreme heat waves recorded in places around the world (Douglas, 2023; Falconer, 2023; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), U.S. Department of Commerce, 2023; NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, 2023; Serrano-Notivoli et al., 2023; Venturelli et al., 2023),

Climate-related disasters can spur action as extreme weather becomes commonplace. Large floods in Korean in July 17 with many victims. The president Joon promised to steer the country towards climate action and take it seriously Web (2023); AFP (2023); Al Jazeera (2023). South Korea has a partnership with the European Union European Commission (2023).

Large ones that get international news coverage:

-   Chernobyl
-   Exxon Valdez
-   Deepwater Horizon
-   the Great Pacific Garbage Patch
-   Fukushima
-   Volkova, Roxburgh and Weston (2021) increased risk of wildfires due to climate change.
-   Martinez-Alier, Joan (2021) and Martinez-Alier, J., Neyra and Rincón (2022) as well as Scheidel et al. (2020) cover how EJAtlas tracks environmental justice cases around the world. Dispues in Eerola (2022).

#### Carbon Accounting {#carbon-accounting}

-   The legislation has created an industry of CO2 accounting with many companies like Greenly, Sustaxo, etc.

### Agroforestry & Permaculture {#agroforestry-permaculture}

-   Food forests for regenerative food systems.

-   Ruba and Talucder (2023) agroforestry plays an active role in achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

-   Irwin et al. (2023)

-   Yadav et al. (2023)

-   Low, G., Dalhaus and Meuwissen (2023)

-   Ollinaho and Kröger (2023) “bioeconomy is not inherently sustainable and may pose considerable risks to biodiversity.”

-   De Queiroz-Stein and Siegel (2023)

-   Gamage et al. (2023) “Organic food and drink sales in 2019 totaled more than 106 billion euros worldwide.”

-   “Would you rather buy a DogeCoin or a regenerative food forest token?” Curve Labs founder Pat Rawson quotes Shiller (2019) in ReFi podcast about Kolektivo. ReFi DAO (2022) (Use as a question for the survey?)

### Biodesign {#biodesign}

-   Neri Oxman, biomaterials MIT media lab, 15. sept. 2020

-   Neri Oxman’s expressions: “ecology-indifferent”, “naturing”, “mother naturing”, “design is a practice of letting go of all that is unnecessary”, “nature should be our single client”.

-   Use imagination

-   Societal movements change things: implication for design: build a community

-   Processes sustain things: implication for design: built an app

### **Quality of Life** {#quality-of-life}

-   Kaklauskas et al. (2023)

-   Fabris and Luburić (2022)

-   Sustainability is part of product quality. If a product is hurting the environment, it’s a low quality product.

### Restoration Ecology {#restoration-ecology}

-   Bioswales

-   Fischer et al. (2021) UN announced 2021–2030 the Decade on Ecosystem Restoration

### Digital Twins {#digital-twins}

-   We can use all the data being recorded to provide a Digital Twin of the planet, nature, ecosystems and human actions to help us change our behavior and optimize for planetary wellbeing.
-   The EU is developing a digital twin of Earth to help sustainability prediction and planning, integrating Earth’s various systems such as climate, hydrology, ecology, etc, into a single model Hoffmann et al. (2023) and Anon. (2023b).

## Mitigation & Adaption {#mitigation-adaption}

#### Emissions Trading Schemes {#emissions-trading-schemes}

-   As of 2023 there isn’t a single global CO2 trading market but rather several local markets as describe in the table below Anon. (n.d.a). Most of the world is not part of a CO2 market.

-   (Liu, H., 2021) and (Ivy Yin, 2023) China’s national emissions trading scheme (ETS) started in 2021 priced at 48 yuan per tonne of CO2, averaged at 58 yuan in 2022.
-   (United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), 2021) report. “The Emissions Gap Report (EGR) 2021: The Heat Is On shows that new national climate pledges combined with other mitigation measures put the world on track for a global temperature rise of 2.7°C by the end of the century. That is well above the goals of the Paris climate agreement and would lead to catastrophic changes in the Earth’s climate. To keep global warming below 1.5°C this century, the aspirational goal of the Paris Agreement, the world needs to halve annual greenhouse gas emissions in the next eight years.
-   (United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), 2021) report “If implemented effectively, net-zero emissions pledges could limit warming to 2.2°C, closer to the well-below 2°C goal of the Paris Agreement. However, many national climate plans delay action until after 2030. The reduction of methane emissions from the fossil fuel, waste and agriculture sectors could help close the emissions gap and reduce warming in the short term, the report finds. Carbon markets could also help slash emissions. But that would only happen if rules are clearly defined and target actual reductions in emissions, while being supported by arrangements to track progress and provide transparency.”
-   (United Nations Environment Programme, 2022) 2022 Emissions Gap report.

#### Fossil Fuels {#fossil-fuels}

-   (see IEA, 2022) reports “Global CO2 emissions from energy combustion and industrial processes rebounded in 2021 to reach their highest ever annual level. A 6% increase from 2020 pushed emissions to 36.3 gigatonnes”
-   Crippa et al. (2022) reports latest figures from the EU’s Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR)
-   Daniel Värjö (2022): The EU Copernicus satellite system reveals new greenhouse emissions previously undetected
-   “Transport greenhouse gas emissions have increased every year since 2014” Anon. (2023c)

Fossil Fuels and Energy

There’s evidence from several countries suggesting moving to renewal energy brings benefits:

-   Amin et al. (2022) suggests “removing fossil fuel subsidies and intra-sectoral electricity price distortions coupled with carbon taxes provides the highest benefits” for both the economy and the environment in Bangladesh.

-   Low, S., Baum and Sovacool (2022) finds considerable uncertainty exists among experts which CO2 reduction methods among nature-based and technology-based are the most effective.

-   Luo et al. (2022) suggests using reinforcement learning to reduce energy use in cooling systems.

-   The true cost of products is hidden. The work is hidden.

-   Montreal protocol eradicates CfCs and te ozone holes became whole again.

-   Tilsted et al. (2023) expects the fossil fuel industry to grow even faster.

#### Emission Scopes {#emission-scopes}

-   National Public Utilities Council (2022) The U.S. National Public Utilities Council (NPUC) decarbonization report provides a useful categorization of ***emission scopes*** applicable to companies and useful for organizing emission reduction schemes.

| Scope   | Source                         |
|---------|--------------------------------|
| Scope 1 | Direct emissions               |
| Scope 2 | Indirect electricity emissions |
| Scope 3 | Value chain emissions          |

From National Public Utilities Council (2022)

For example, for consumers in Australian states and territories in 2018, 83% of the GHG emissions are Scope 3, meaning indirect emissions in the value chain Goodwin et al. (2023)

-   Mapping pollution sources in China Xie et al. (2021)

-   The share of CO2 emissions among people is highly unequal across the world (termed ***Carbon Inequality***). Chancel (2022) reports “while one-tenth of the global population is responsible for nearly half of all emissions, half of the population emits less than 12%”.

-   One example is the ICT sector.

-   Bajarin (n.d.) Over 300 million PCs sold in 2022

    -   Anon. (2021) Estonian company “sustainable lifecycle management of IT equipment”
    -   Ärileht (23.09.2022, 12:53) Recycle your phone, FoxWay and Circular economy for PCs.
    -   Zhou et al. (2022) ICT is an example of inequality, while emerging economies bear 82% of the emissions, developed countries gain 58% of value.

#### Carbon Credits {#carbon-credits}

-   KlimaDAO (2023) call for an open standard

#### Carbon Capture {#carbon-capture}

-   Vitillo et al. (2022) illustrates how direct air capture of CO2 is difficult because of low concentration and CO2 capture at the source of the emissions is more feasible.

-   Gaure and Golombek (2022) simulate a CO2 free electricity generation system in the European Union where “98% of total electricity production is generated by wind power and solar; the remainder is covered by a backup technology.”. The authors stipulate it’s possible to power the EU without producing CO2 emissions.

-   **Important: “creating sustainability trust in companies in realtime”**

-   Howard et al. (2017) argues Oceans play crucial role in carbon capture.

#### Social Cost of Carbon {#social-cost-of-carbon}

-   Kornek et al. (2021) and Zhen, Tian and Ye (2018) suggest “The (Social Cost of Carbon) SCC measures the additional damage caused by an extra unit of emissions” with variations between countries (Tol (2019)) and regions (Wang, Y., Ma and Wang (2022)). Stanford University (2021) defines the social cost of carbon “the cost of the damages created by one extra ton of carbon dioxide emissions”

-   Stern (2022) reports carbon-neutral economy needs higher CO2 prices. Rennert et al. (2022): Carbon price should be 3,6x higher that it is currently (2022). Ritz (2022) argues optimal CO2 prices could be highly asymmetric, low in some countries and high (above the social cost of CO2) in countries where production is very polluting.

-   As shown in the Phillipines by Cheng and Han (2022), with increasing extreme weather events, “businesses are more likely to emerge in areas where infrastructure is resilient to climate hazards”. Jerrett, Jina and Marlier (2022) says, In California, “Wildfires are the second most important source of emissions in 2020” and “Wildfires in 2020 negate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from other sectors.”

-   Lin et al. (2022) says, apart from CO2, reduction of other atmospheric pollutants, such as non-CO2 greenhouse gases (GHGs) and short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) is required for climate stability.

-   TEDx Talks (2020) sustainability is filled with complexities, where child labor, prostitution, poverty, CO2 emission, dangerous chemicals, and many other issues became intertwined.

-   Wang, T.-P. and Teng (2022): Quantifying climate damage proposes scenarios of climate damage.

#### Nationally Determined Contributions {#nationally-determined-contributions}

-   Climate Analytics and NewClimate Institute (2023) Climate Action Tracker data portal allows to compare countries.

| Country or Region    | **NDC target**          |

## **Biomimicry** {#biomimicry}

-   

## Eco-Design {#eco-design}

***Designing for Sustainability aka Circular Design or Eco-Design*** encompasses all human activities, making this pursuit an over-arching challenge across all industries also known as circular economy. Assuming that as individuals we want to act in a sustainable way, how exactly would be go about doing that?

-   “Evolution of design for sustainability: From product design to design for system innovations and transitions”

Circular economy is a tiny part of the world economy. Circle Economy (2022) reports only 8.6% of world economy is circular and *100B tonnes of virgin materials* are sourced every year.

-   McGinty (Thu, 08/06/2020 - 11:25): How to Build a Circular Economy
-   Dull (2021) book
-   Chapman (2009) argues in his seminal paper (and later in his book) for ***“Emotionally Durable Design”***, the simple idea that we hold to things we value and thus they are sustainable. We don’t throw away a necklace gifted to us by mom, indeed this object might be passed down for centuries. Rose (2015) has a similar idea, where ***“Enchanted Objects”*** become so interlinked with us, we’re unlikely to throw them away.
-   Growing public understanding of how nature works and intersects with our use of money.
-   Hedberg and Šipka (2021) argues digitization and data sharing is a requirement for building a circular economy.
-   Gupta et al. (2023) argues software is key to building more sustainable products, already for decades. More recently, companies like AutoDesk are putting CO2 calculations inside their design software.
-   Anon. (n.d.b): “Sustainability starts in the design process, and AI can help”.
-   iGenius (2020)
-   Very simple. “Carbon pricing is not there to punish people,” says Lion Hirth Lion Hirth (n.d.). “It’s there to remind us, when we take travel, heating, consumption decisions that the true cost of fossil fuels comprises not only mining and processing, but also the damage done by the CO2 they release.”

#### *Design Implications:* {#design-implications-2}

-   AI can help us make sense of the vast amounts of sustainability data generated daily.

### Policy Context {#policy-context}

-   European Parliament (2022) proposal “On 30 March 2022, the European Commission put forward a proposal for a regulation establishing a general framework for setting eco-design requirements for sustainable products, repealing rules currently in force which concentrate on energy-related products only.”
-   Anon. (n.d.c) report: The EU has a ***taxonomy of environmentally sustainable economic activities*** published by the Technical Expert Group (TEG) on sustainable finance.
-   Virginijus Sinkevičius, EU Commissioner for the Environment, Oceans and Fisheries, is quoted as describing eco-design “respects the boundaries of our planet” European Commission (2022a)
-   The proposal for a Nature Restoration Law by the European Commission requiring member countries to restore 20% of EU’s degraded ecosystems by 2030 and full restoration by 2050 has not yet passed Anon. (2023d) and is facing a backlash David Pinto (2023).
-   Manzardo et al. (2021) **(need access!)**
-   Iñarra et al. (2022) **(need access!)**

-   de Otazu et al. (2022) **Life Cycle Assessment and environmental impact analysis are needed to provide eco-design scenarios.**
-   Nuez, Ruiz-García and Osorio (2022) shows how electric vehicles may increase CO2 emissions in some areas, such as Canary Islands, where electricity production is polluting.
-   Rossi, Cappelletti and Germani (2022) shows how introducing sustainability early in the design process and providing scenarios where sustainability is a metric, it’s possible to achieve more eco-friendly designs.
-   Tiernan et al. (2022) microplastics are a real concern
-   Arranz, Sena and Kwong (2022) developing circular economy is really complex

-   Ruiz-Pastor et al. (2022)
-   Miyoshi et al. (2022) takes the example of ink toner bottles and shows in a case study how standardized compatibility between older and newer systems can save resources and results in sustainability savings.

Again, AI has the potential to provide the parameters for sustainability.

-   Singh and Sarkar (2023) proposes an AI tool for deciding the suitable life cycle design parameters.

### Extended Producer Responsibility {#extended-producer-responsibility}

One type of legislation that works?

-   Steenmans and Ulfbeck (2023) Argues for the need to engage companies through legislation and shift from waste-centered laws to product design regulations.

-   Peng, Shi and Tong (2023) finds that the Carbon Disclosure Project has been a crucial tool to empower ERP in Chinese auto-producers.

-   Liu, K. et al. (2023) reports, e–waste is growing 3%–5% every year, globally. Thukral and Singh (2023) identifies several barriers to e-waste management among producers including lack of awareness and infrastructure, attitudinal barriers, existing *informal* e-waste sector, and the need for an e-waste license.

-   In Europe, there’s large variance between member states when in comes to textile recycling: while Estonia and France are the only EU countries where separate collection of textiles is required by law, in Estonia 100% of the textiles were burned in an incinerator in 2018 while in France textiles are covered by an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme leading to higher recovery rates (Ibid).

-   Christiansen, Hasse and Tønder (2021): Nonetheless, EPR schemes do not guarantee circularity and may instead be designed around fees to finance waste management in linear economy models.

-   Jacques Vernier (2021): French EPR scheme was upgraded in 2020 to become more circular.

-   In any case, strong consumer legislation (such as EPR) has a direct influence on producers’ actions. For example, in HKTDC Research (2022)@, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council notified textile producers in July 2022 reminding factories to produce to French standards in order to be able enter the EU market.

#### *Design implications:* {#design-implications-3}

-   ERP and CDP data should be part of Green Filter.\*

### Return, Repair, Reuse {#return-repair-reuse}

-   There’s a growing number of companies providing re-use of existing items.
-   Anon. (n.d.d) For example, Swap furniture in Estonia

Bring back your bottle and cup after use.

-   Ruiz-Pastor and Mesa (2023) proposes a **product repairability index (PRI)**
-   Formentini and Ramanujan (2023)
-   Recycling (Lenovo, 08-29-22) “rethinking product design and inspiring consumers to expect more from their devices”
-   “design is a tool to make complexity comprehensible” like the Helsinki chapel. there’s either or a priest or a social worker. it’s the perfect public service. “limit the barrier of entry for people to discover”. elegant.
-   Zeynep Falay von Flittner (n.d.)

### Packaging {#packaging}

Packaging is a rapidly growing industry which generates large amounts of waste Ada et al. (2023). Bradley and Corsini (2023): “Over 161 million tonnes of plastic packaging is produced annually.”

## Conclusion {#conclusion}

-   A wide range of legislative proposals, targets, organizations, and goals already exists across the Europepean Union. Upcoming laws will harmonize approaches to sustainability and raise standards for all members countries, in turn influencing producers who wish to sell in the EU common market.

-   In unison, the reviewed technologies and practices move us closer to enabling *realtime ESG*: up-do-date transparent information about how our product are produced. Realtime ESG is a building block to enable consumers and investors make more accurate, real-world purchase decisions.
