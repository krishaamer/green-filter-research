# What is Sustainability? {#what-is-sustainability}

-   *Sustainability* was first mentioned in Hannß Carl von Carlowitz (1713) in the context of forestry in his seminal book *Sylvicultura oeconomica* discussing sustainable forest management. The field is known today as *sustainable yield* of *natural capital* required to maintain *ecosystem services* (Peter Kareiva et al. (2011)).
-   Climate data visualization has a long history too, starting with ***Alexander von Humboldt,*** who revolutionized cartography by inventing the first isothermal maps around 1816, showing areas with similar temperature, variations in altitude and seasons.
-   *Alexander von Humboldt’s Original Isotherms Circa 1838* (2023): computer models of Father of climatology Alexander von Humboldt Isotherms
-   Honton (2022)
-   Brohan et al. (2012) reports global temperature measurement starts from the 1880s where we have the first records from ships.
-   Industrial revolution

##  {#section}

-   Le Provost et al. (2022): Contemporary studies have shown *biodiversity* as one key factor to maintain delivery of ecosystem services.

-   Keeble (1988) reported in April 1987 (a few months after I was born) that *‘residents in high-income countries lead lifestyles incompatible with planetary boundaries’*. While my home Estonia at the time was considered low-income, a small nation on the verge of poverty behind the Iron Curtain occupation of the Soviet Occupy, we now in 2023, have indeed reached high-income status.

-   Commodities!! — the most effective things are — food — transport — fashion? — plant trees

-   Catherine Clifford (2022) reports that Amazon is committing 2B USD to a Climate Pledge Fund trying to find startup companies that can fix climate problems.

-   Amazon’s founder Bezos. ″‘Good intentions don’t work, mechanisms do’“.

-   Moberg et al. (2019) reports daily human activities emission contribution on average in France, Germany, Norway and Sweden:

| Emission Share | Category |
|----------------|----------|
| 21%            | Housing  |
| 30%            | Food     |
| 34%            | Mobility |
| 15%            | Other    |

## Biodiversity Reduction {#biodiversity-reduction}

-   UEBT (2022) reports “Biodiversity awareness is now at 72% or higher in all countries sampled, compared to only 29% or higher across countries sampled in 2009.”
-   United Nations Convention on Biodiversity

### Ecosystem Services {#ecosystem-services}

-   Bousfield et al. (2022) reports there’s evidence paying landowners for the ecosystem services their forests provide may reduce deforestation.
-   In Estonia, startups Arbonic and Single.Earth are trialing this approach in several forests.
-   Han & Chen (2022) identifies nature-based solutions “land re-naturalization (such as afforestation and wetland restoration)”
-   Noriega et al. (2018) attempts to quantify the ecosystem services (ES) provided by insects. While it can be assumed much of the flora and fauna are crucial for Earth’s systems, science is still in the process of understanding and quantifying its contributions. Meanwhile the destruction pressure on ecosystems is rapidly increasing (cite A B C).

### Biodiversity {#biodiversity}

-   Almond, R.E.A. et al. (n.d.) reports, the number of species killed, mass destruction of nature. “69% decline in the relative abundance of monitored wildlife populations around the world between 1970 and 2018. Latin America shows the greatest regional decline in average population abundance (94%), while freshwater species populations have seen the greatest overall global decline (83%).”

-   UNEP (Tue, 12/20/2022 - 07:44): **The Convention on Biodiversity 2022 (COP15) adopted the first global biodiversity framework to accompany climate goals.**

## Pollution {#pollution}

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[0] }} />

-   Martinez-Alier (2021) and Martinez-Alier et al. (2022) as well as Scheidel et al. (2020) cover how EJAtlas tracks environmental justice cases around the world. Dispues in Eerola (2022).

### Air Pollution and Clean Air {#air-pollution-and-clean-air}

-   Grounbreaking research by Lim et al. (2022) analyzed over 400000 individuals in England, South Korea and Taiwan establishes exposure to 2.5μm PM (PM2.5) air pollution as a cause for lung cancer. Bouscasse et al. (2022) finds strong health and economic benefits across the board from air pollution reduction in France.
-   In Hannah Devlin (2022), prof Tony Mok, of the Chinese University of Hong Kong: “We have known about the link between pollution and lung cancer for a long time, and we now have a possible explanation for it. As consumption of fossil fuels goes hand in hand with pollution and carbon emissions, we have a strong mandate for tackling these issues – for both environmental and health reasons.”

**Design Implications**: *People live in the polluted areas are so used to it. What app to wake them up? “You live in a highly polluted area. Here’s the TOP 10 companies causing pollution. Here’s what you can do.”*

### Health {#health}

-   Sarah Ludwig Rausch & Neha Pathak (2021): “Human health is central to all sustainability efforts.”All of these (food, housing, power, and health care), and the stress that the lack of them generate, play a huge role in our health,” Hollis says.”

-   *Public Health Linkages with Sustainability* (2013)

-   Guidotti (2015)

-   “Sustainability is important for many reasons including: Environmental Quality – In order to have healthy communities, we need clean air, natural resources, and a nontoxic environment.”

### Housing {#housing}

-   According to Debnath et al. (2022) 39% of global CO2 emissions comes from the building sector.

### Carbon Labeling {#carbon-labeling}

-   Brian Kateman (2020): Carbon labeling is voluntary and practiced by only a handful of companies. The U.S. restaurant chain *Just Salad* , U.K.-based vegan meat-alternative *Quorn* and plant milk *Oatly* provide carbon labeling on their products.

-   Ibid and ClimatePartner (2020): Companies like ClimatePartner and Carbon Calories offers labeling consumer goods with emission data as a service.

-   The Carbon Trust (n.d.): The Carbon Trust reports it’s certified 27 thousand product footprints.

-   Ivanova et al. (2020): The average per capita carbon footprint of North America 13.4, Europe 7.5, Africa and the Middle East 1.7 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per capita.

-   Ivanova et al. (2020) “establish consumption options with a high mitigation potential measured in tons of CO2eq/capita/yr.”

-   55% of emissions come from energy production.

-   American Press Institute (2022) finds that only 37% percent of U.S. Gen-Z and Millenials follow news related to environmental issues.

-   Making advanced maps to convince people to make changes: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/climate-resilience-geography-nyc-taxis-photorealistic-3d-maps-carto

-   Cohen & Vandenbergh (2012) argues carbon labels do influence consumer choice towards sustainability.

-   Crippa et al. (2022) shows global emissions 4.81 tonnes CO2 per capita. World Resources Institute (2020) shows the top 5 largest per capita CO2 emissions come from Oil Producers - Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, Brunei Darussalam in 2020.

-   European Commission. Joint Research Centre. (2022) provides CO2 emissions for all the countries around the world, per total emissions the top 10 are China, U.S.A. the European Union, India, Russia, Japan, Iran, South Korea, Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia as of 2021.

### Nationally Determined Contributions {#nationally-determined-contributions}

-   Climate Analytics & NewClimate Institute (2023) Climate Action Tracker data portal allows to compare countries.

| Country or Region    | **NDC target**          |
|----------------------|-------------------------|
| China                | Highly insufficient     |
| Indonesia            | Highly insufficient     |

-   UNFCCC. Secretariat (2022)
-   The State of Nationally Determined Contributions: 2022 Fransen et al. (2022) notes that the majority of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are dependent on financial assistance from the international community.

### Growing Population {#growing-population}

-   According to The Economic Times (2022), in November 2022, Planet Earth’s population reached 8 Billion people.
-   The future population projections in United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2022) predict 8.5B people by 2030 and 9.7B by 2050.
-   While population growth puts higher pressure on Earth’s resources, some research shows the effect is more from wasteful lifestyles than the raw number of people (**FIND CITATION**).

### Overconsumption, Climate Change, Pollution {#overconsumption-climate-change-pollution}

-   In Anthony Leiserowitz et al. (2022), a large scale study on Meta’s Facebook (n=108946), “Respondents in Spain (65%), Sweden (61%), and Taiwan (60%) are the most likely to say that climate change is mostly caused by human activities”.
-   Overconsumption is one of the root causes of climate change and marine plastic pollution.
-   Ford et al. (2022) and Lavers et al. (2022) suggest strong linkage of climate change and marine plastic pollution “along with other stressors that threaten the resilience of species and habitats sensitive to both climate change and plastic pollution”.
-   Eesti Vabariigi Valitsus (2022) Estonian Green Deal Action Plan (Eesti Rohepöörde Tegevusplaan).
-   WWF (2022) **case study highlights how 4 biodiverse regions Cerrado in Brazil, Chaco in Argentina, Sumatra in Indonesia, and the Cuvette Centrale in Democratic Republic of Congo are experiencing rapid destruction due to consumer demand in the European Union.**
-   McGinty (Thu, 08/06/2020 - 11:25): How to Build a Circular Economy
-   Ivanova et al. (2020): “Around two-thirds of global GHG emissions are directly and indirectly linked to household consumption, with a global average of about 6 tCO2eq/cap.”
-   Armstrong McKay et al. (2022) discusses tipping points

### Forests {#forests}

-   Frédéric Simon (2022) Europe rapidly losing its forest carbon sink.

-   Burning of biomass undermines carbon capture.

### Ethics and Cruelty {#ethics-and-cruelty}

-   Cruelty free brands
-   Rank companies based on sustainability
-   BCorp
-   ESG
-   Trash found in ocean / nature etc
-   Help you to decide: what to buy, how to save, where to invest
-   Increase your investment point by matching with your contribution /.
-   Point of Sales integration (know the SKU you buy). Integrate to the financial eco footprint (no need to scan the product). What’s the name of the startup that does this?
-   Precision Fermentation and Cultivated Meat: Meat products without farm animals

## Carbon Markets {#carbon-markets}

-   Sipthorpe et al. (2022) compares traditional and blockchain-based solutions to carbon trading.
-   Liu (2021) and Ivy Yin (2023) China’s national emissions trading scheme (ETS) started in 2021 priced at 48 yuan per tonne of CO2, averaged at 58 yuan in 2022.
-   United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) (2021) report. “The Emissions Gap Report (EGR) 2021: The Heat Is On shows that new national climate pledges combined with other mitigation measures put the world on track for a global temperature rise of 2.7°C by the end of the century. That is well above the goals of the Paris climate agreement and would lead to catastrophic changes in the Earth’s climate. To keep global warming below 1.5°C this century, the aspirational goal of the Paris Agreement, the world needs to halve annual greenhouse gas emissions in the next eight years.
-   United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) (2021) report “If implemented effectively, net-zero emissions pledges could limit warming to 2.2°C, closer to the well-below 2°C goal of the Paris Agreement. However, many national climate plans delay action until after 2030. The reduction of methane emissions from the fossil fuel, waste and agriculture sectors could help close the emissions gap and reduce warming in the short term, the report finds. Carbon markets could also help slash emissions. But that would only happen if rules are clearly defined and target actual reductions in emissions, while being supported by arrangements to track progress and provide transparency.”
-   United Nations Environment Programme (2022) 2022 Emissions Gap report.

### Fossil Fuels and Energy {#fossil-fuels-and-energy}

There’s evidence from several countries suggesting moving to renewal energy brings benefits:

-   Amin et al. (2022) suggests “removing fossil fuel subsidies and intra-sectoral electricity price distortions coupled with carbon taxes provides the highest benefits” for both the economy and the environment in Bangladesh.

-   Low et al. (2022) finds considerable uncertainty exists among experts which CO2 reduction methods among nature-based and technology-based are the most effective.

-   Luo et al. (2022) suggests using reinforcement learning to reduce energy use in cooling systems.

-   The true cost of products is hidden. The work is hidden.

### Emission Scopes {#emission-scopes}

-   National Public Utilities Council (2022): The U.S. National Public Utilities Council (NPUC) utility decarbonization report provides a useful categorization of company emissions:

| Scope   | Source                         |
|---------|--------------------------------|
| Scope 1 | Direct emissions               |
| Scope 2 | Indirect electricity emissions |
| Scope 3 | Value chain emissions          |

### Cap and Trade {#cap-and-trade}

-   adsas

### Carbon Inequality {#carbon-inequality}

-   Chancel (2022) suggests “while one-tenth of the global population is responsible for nearly half of all emissions, half of the population emits less than 12% of it”.

### Carbon Credit Retirement {#carbon-credit-retirement}

-   ads

### Carbon Capture {#carbon-capture}

-   Vitillo et al. (2022) argues

-   Gaure & Golombek (2022): “98% of total electricity production is generated by wind power and solar; the remainder is covered by a backup technology.”

-   Make commerce more transparent

-   **Important: “creating sustainability trust in companies in realtime”**

### Social Cost of Carbon {#social-cost-of-carbon}

-   Rennert et al. (2022): Carbon price should be 3,6x higher.

-   Stanford University (2021): “the cost of the damages created by one extra ton of carbon dioxide emissions”

-   Kornek et al. (2021) and Zhen et al. (2018) suggest “The (Social Cost of Carbon) SCC measures the additional damage caused by an extra unit of emissions” with variations between countries (Tol (2019)) and regions (Y. Wang et al. (2022)).

-   Stern (2022) reports carbon-neutral economy needs higher CO2 prices.

-   Howard et al. (2017) argues Oceans play crucial role in carbon capture.

-   Ritz (2022) says Carbon prices are highly asymmetric.

-   Lin et al. (2022) says, apart from CO2, reduction of other atmospheric pollutants, such as non-CO2 greenhouse gases (GHGs) and short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) is required for climate stability.

-   As shown in the Phillipines by Cheng & Han (2022), with increasing extreme weather events, “businesses are more likely to emerge in areas where infrastructure is resilient to climate hazards”.

-   Jerrett et al. (2022) says, In California, “Wildfires are the second most important source of emissions in 2020” and “Wildfires in 2020 negate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from other sectors.”

-   T.-P. Wang & Teng (2022): Quantifying climate damage proposes scenarios of climate damage.

## Provenance and Traceability {#provenance-and-traceability}

-   Ethereum blockchain and animal rights. “Blockchain can provide a transparent, immutable record of the provenance of products. This can be especially useful for verifying claims made about animal welfare. For example, products claiming to be”free-range,” “organic,” or “sustainably sourced” could have their entire lifecycle recorded on the blockchain, from birth to shelf, allowing consumers to verify these claims.”

### Oracles for Sustainability Data {#oracles-for-sustainability-data}

A data oracle is the concept of a source of real-world data which can be ingested through an application programming interface (API) by, for example, a blockchain system. There are many databases of sustainability information which could serve as an oracle for “green filter”, including carbon labeling, packaging, transportation, consumption, and waste.

-   Ethereum (2023)

-   Caldarelli et al. (2020) notes it’s a challenge to ensure the accuracy and trustworthiness of real-world data from Oracles.

-   Brady Dale (2021) and Chainlink (2022): The largest Oracle provider ChainLink founder Sergey Nazarov believes the collaboration of oracles and blockchains can make carbon credits more trustworthy.

## Greenwashing {#greenwashing}

-   Greenwashing is a large detractor from environmental action as it’s difficult to know what is sustainable and what is not.

-   <s>Reading EU Commission’s proposals, one might think the politicians have everything under control, we can relax and continue the same lifestyles as before. Unfortunately, this is not true. As with ESG, while the good intentions may be there, the reality is emissions keep rising, while they should be falling. It’s possible to curb greenwashing!</s>

-   Sahota (2021): “thanks to other emerging technology like IoT sensors (to collect ESG data) and blockchain (to track transactions), we have the infrastructure to collect more data, particularly for machine consumption. By measuring real-time energy usage, transportation routes, manufacturing waste, and so forth, we have more quantifiable ways to track corporations’ environmental performance without relying purely on what they say.”

-   Bingler et al. (2021) and Sahota (2021) ClimateBert AI finds rampant greenwashing

-   Yu (2021) ESG is filled with greenwashing.

-   US Securities and Exchange Commission (2022): In the USA: *“If it’s easy to tell if milk is fat-free by just looking at the nutrition label, it might be time to make it easier to tell if”green” or “sustainable” funds are really what they say they are.”* says Gary Gensler, head of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

-   Frances Schwartzkopff (2022) suggests the ESMA and EU has strengthened legislation to counter ESG greenwashing.

-   Sustainability is fragmented. How can billions of people find greener alternatives and build closer relationships with sustainability-focused companies? Greenwashing is widespread, how can we feel trust, honesty, and transparency? A research project for designing a sustainable shopping, savings, and investing companion.

-   Laws against greenwashing

-   US Securities and Exchange Commission (2022) Both the European Commission and the Chair of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Gary Gensler have called for more legislation to curb business greenwashing practices.

-   André & Valenciano-Salazar (2022): Until new legislation is in place (2030 in the EU), consumer awareness is crucial as currently most emission-reduction programs are voluntary and thus affected by consumer demand. Geoffrey Supran (2022) Greenwashing is widespread in company social media communications.

-   Purkiss et al. (2022) highlights the confusion between compostable and biodegradable plastics and public misunderstanding what happens to these plastics when they reach the landfill. For example, “Most plastics marketed as”home compostable” don’t actually work, with as much as 60% failing to disintegrate after six months”.

-   Napper & Thompson (2019): Shopping bags marketed as *biodegradable* don’t show deterioration after 3 years in salt-water sea environment ..

-   Frédéric Simon (2020) and Kira Taylor (2021): While the EU has proposed legislation to curb greenwashing, EU climate policy itself has been criticized for greenwashing. Sometimes greenwashing comes under legislative protection.

-   Booth (2022) describe how “A recent investigation shows illegal logging of protected areas in eastern European countries that supplies residential wood pellets in Italy. Belgium, Denmark, and the Netherlands are importing pellets from Estonia, where protected areas are logged for pellets and the country has lost its forest carbon sink, despite large-scale wood pellet plants being certified ‘sustainable’ by the Sustainable Biomass Program”. A number of new AI-based tools aim to find instances of greenwashing.

-   “Climate Bonds Initiative Calls for Greening of \$55trn Short-Term Debt Market” (2022): Climate Bonds Initiativegreening the \$55 trillion short-term debt market

-   **Design Implications:** *As a consumer, I can get notified by the app about highlights of poor legislation refuted by science*.

## Conclusion {#conclusion}

-   A wide range of legislative proposals, targets, organizations, and goals already exists across Europe. Upcoming laws will harmonize approaches to sustainability and raise standards for all members countries, in turn influencing producers who wish to sell in the EU common market.

-   In unison, the reviewed technologies and practices move us closer to enabling *realtime ESG*: up-do-date transparent information about how our product are produced. Realtime ESG is necessary a building block to enable consumers and investors make more accurate, real-world purchase decisions.
