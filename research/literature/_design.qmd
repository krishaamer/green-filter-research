> "Design makes complexity comprehensible." - [@normanLivingComplexity2016]

-   I like this quote from the grand old man of design, Don Norman. For me it's like the Helsinki chapel, in Finland. There's either or a priest or a social worker present. It's the perfect public service. It doesn't require one to be religious. Limits the barrier of entry for people to discover. Elegant.

## Eco-Design: Design as Political Action at Scale

Politics matters in sustainability. In Brazil, deforestation fell 60% in 1 year, based on remote satellite reconnaissance, after the election of a more pro-environment leadership [@wattsAmazonDeforestationFalls2023]. The monumental task of removing several gigatons of CO~2e~ from the atmosphere requires massive policy shifts and collaboration across countries and industries [@macklerPolicyAgendaGigatonscale2021]. Designing the right legislative measures can be hugely impactful. The EU "Green Deal" legislative strategy is comprehensive and backed by science, with the EU Commission has releasing strategic foresight reports since 2020 [@europeancommissionStrategicForesight2023] and becoming a driving force of transformative climate legislation in Europe. 

Timeline of the policy context in Europe: In 2019 by the von der Leyen commission adopted the European Union (EU) Green Deal strategy. In 2021 the Commision proposed a goal of reducing CO2e emissions by 55% by 2030 under the *Fit for 55* policy package consisting of a wide range of economic measures. In November 2022, the proposal was adopted by the EU Council and EU Parliament with an updated goal of 57% of CO2e reductions compared to 1990, set to become a binding law for all EU member countries [@europeancommissionEuropeanGreenDeal2019; @europeancommissionSustainableEurope20302019; @EUReachesAgreement2022; @europeancouncilFit55EU2022]. In March 2022, the EU Circular Economy Action Plan was adopted, looking to make sustainable products *the norm* in EU and *empowering consumers* as described in [@europeancommissionCircularEconomyAction2022]. 

Consumer products' overall life-cycle environmental impact is defined in the design process by the materials and energy resources needed and the post-consumer potential for reuse or recycling. In the context of the European Union, *eco-design* has gained political support from European Commission as part of the EU's *"Green Deal"* legislative strategy, aiming to transform European economies into sustainability leaders [@commissionEcodesignYourFuture2014]. The Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR) entered into force in July 2024 [@europeancommissionEcodesignSustainableProducts2024] following the [@europeanparliamentEcodesignSustainableProducts2022] proposal whereby the European Commission established a general framework for *eco-design: "requirements for sustainable products, repealing rules \[referring to the previous Eco-Design Directive (2009/125/EC)\] currently in force which concentrate on energy-related products only,"* setting up a level playing-field for the organizations operating on the EU single market. Virginijus Sinkevičius, the EU Commissioner for the Environment, Oceans and Fisheries, is quoted as describing eco-design as design that *"respects the boundaries of our planet"* [@europeancommissionGreenDealNew2022].

| Feature | Benefit |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Durable | Reduces the need to frequently replace the product |
| Reusable | Extends the product's life-cycle; sell or share to the next user |
| Reparable | Extends the product's life-cycle; fix instead of discarding |
| Upgradable | Extends the product's life-cycle; improve performance without complete replacement. |
| Easy to Maintain | Reduce resources needed to keep the product functional |
| Easy to Refurbish | Support second-hand use and circular economy |
| Easy to Recycle | Support material recovery at end of the product's life to reduce new resource extraction and pollution |
| Energy Efficient | Reduce product's CO2 footprint and operating costs |
| Resource Efficient | Reduce product's use of raw materials and energy during production and life-cycle |

: The 9 qualities of *eco-designed products* based on the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR) enacted as law in the EU as of July 2024 [@luttinFullOverviewEU2025; @europeanparliamentEcodesignSustainableProducts2022].

Eco-Design for sustainable products is a key EU sustainable policy design tool and each product covered by the ESPR is required to have a *Digital Product Passport* (DPP) which enables improved processing within the supply chain and includes detailed information to empower consumers to understand the environmental footprint of their purchases [@europeancommissionEcodesignSustainableProducts2022]. It's safe to say the large majority of products available today do not meet these criteria. Given this far-reaching legislative effort, we have an opportunity to re-imagine how every product can be an eco-product and how they circulate in our circular economy. The Director of the French environmental NGO Pôle Eco-conception describes eco-design as "\[l\]ocated at the interface between consumption and production patterns, eco-design helps to structure the market for products and services using a life cycle approach and tangible criteria" [@chouaiBLOGEcodesignObsolete2024].

The European Commission is set to propose a legally-binding 90% emissions reduction from 1990 levels to be achieved by 2040; however, political pushback by governments is likely to weaken the goal; the EU climate chief Teresa Ribera is looking for ways to find pragmatic solutions, by, for example, considering some use of carbon credits (thus far, all the goals needed to be achieved within the borders of EU; buying carbon credits from places outside the EU would not be counted as emissions reduction) [@weiseBrusselsProposePragmatic2025; @taylorQAEUPropose2025].

The above chart shows how the European Union has been on a path of climate legislation transformation.

```{python}
eu_green_deal()
```

The above chart illustrated the European "Green Deal".

In the countries that make up the European Union (EU), a wide range of legislative proposals, targets, organizations, and goals have existed for decades. It's not that the EU didn't have an overarching environmental policy before; rather it was  vague and filled with loop-holes. Upcoming laws cited above aim to harmonize approaches to sustainability and raise standards for all members states, in turn influencing producers who wish to sell in the EU common market. National governments need to adapt EU legislation to local contexts. For example Estonian government adopted the Estonian Green Deal Action Plan (Eesti Rohepöörde Tegevusplaan) [@eestivabariigivalitsusRohepoordeTegevusplaan2022]. From the legislative perspective, NFRD (Non-Financial Reporting Directive) is replaced by CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive) and ESRS reporting is the standard to meet CSRD requirements.

The EU also has a *taxonomy of environmentally sustainable economic activities* published by the Technical Expert Group (TEG) on sustainable finance, as detailed in the report by [@EUTaxonomySustainable].

The EU is also concerned with supply-chain deforestation. Sustainable Products and EUDR (European Union Deforestation Regulation) work hand-in-hand as part of EU's legislative efforts to promote sustainability. EUDR applies to all products placed on the market from December 2024 and June 2025 for small businesses. The proposal for a Nature Restoration Law by the European Commission requiring member countries to restore 20% of EU's degraded ecosystems by 2030 and full restoration by 2050 has not yet passed (as of writing) [@ScientistsUrgeEuropean2023] and is facing a backlash [@davidpintoBacklashNatureRestoration2023].

-   Europe is transforming into a hotbed of sustainability. One of the EU goals is reducing careless consumption. Tacking our consumption habits can help support eco-designed products. It's up to legislators to provide sustainable products on our marketplace... but until this happens, we can use the green filter.

### Beyond Recycling: Return, Repair, Reuse

-   There's a growing number of companies providing re-use of existing items.

-   @SmartSwap For example, Swap furniture in Estonia

-   The universal recycling symbol creator Gary Anderson created the symbol when he was an architecture student in California, USC (uni southern california) in 1970 at the age of 23, inspired by Silent Spring, Earth Day, and Bauhaus, Buccky Fuller, Spaceship Earth, printing presses, and the Woolmark logo for wool industry certification, and the Mobius strip, for a competition hold by a packaging firm that was making paper containers for packaging [@swapsocietyRecyclingSymbolDesigner2023].

-   The power of defaults. Make the sustainable option the default @gigerenzerWhyHeuristicsWork2008 "simple heuristics built from basic rules; how heuristics are selected and structured in social and physical environments; concept of ecological rationality to identify the environmental conditions under which particular heuristics succeed or fail"

-   standardising reuse across the globe, a body to create a reuse standard is holding a competition to create e reuse symbol

### Legislative Efforts Around the World

Europe is not the only region undertaking legislative efforts to promote sustainability. In the US, the *Inflation Reduction Act* provided funding to development of de-carbonizing technologies and includes plans to combat air pollution, reduce green house gases and address environmental injustices [@rajagopalanInflationReductionAct2023].

Many other jurisdictions also have laws that aim to reduce the environmental impact of products throughout their life cycles.

For instance Australia has a Product Stewardship (PS) scheme, which also includes an investment fund targeted at increasing the recycling rates of specific products [@australiangovernmentProductStewardshipAustralia2024]. Australia, Japan, and Taiwan all have Sustainable Procurement schemes prioritizing greener products in public purchases \[ADD CITATION\].

### Eco-Modulation: Incentive Design for Extended Producer Responsibility and Product Stewardship

Eco-modulation means harder to recycle items are more expensive for the producer. Recycling fees take into account eco-design: an item from a single material is easier (cheaper) to recycle than product from composite materials.

Eco-modulation makes the hidden cost of hard-to-recycle formats directly visible on the invoice.

While Taiwan doesn't yet have a specific eco-design law, there are various pieces of legislation promoting circular economy \[ADD CITATION\]. Already in 1988 Taiwan implemented an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme, followed by a recycling system (initially focused on electronic items) in 1998 [@chongProductStewardshipSchemes2009]. Eco-design initiatives in Taiwan started at least as early as 1994, when Taiwanese companies and universities noticed international sustainability trends and began to implement their own sustainable design initiatives [@jahaulewischenEcodesignActivitiesTaiwan2005].

Deposit Return Schemes (DRS)

In California, part of the EPR regulation is a large pool of funding for cleaning up historic pollution resulting from [@heffernanPlasticRecyclingPodcast2024 @moolmanEcoModulationEPRNew2024]

The key to comparing Product Stewardship, Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), and Eco-Design is the scope, as illustrated in the chart below. While Product Stewardship (PS) and Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) deal mostly with the end of the product life-cycle (they are *reactive*), including their disposal and recycling (EPR going a step further than PS by shifting the responsibility to the producer), eco-design moves sustainability up the design chain (lbeing *pro-active*), setting standards for making better products - in essence, attempting to *design-out* the waste.

```{python}
compare_ps_epr_ecodesign()
```

Extended Producer Responsibility Enables Companies to be Resposible.

Popular blogs such as [@kohliHowDesignersCan2019] and [@loseWaysUXDesign2023] offer many suggestions how designers can help people become more sustainable in their daily lives yet focusing on the end-user neglects the producers' responsibility (termed as Extended Producer Responsibility or ERP) in waste management studies.

Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is a policy tool first proposed by Thomas Lindhqvist in Sweden in 1990 and described in detail in his PhD thesis [@lindhqvist1990modeller;@lindhqvistExtendedProducerResponsibility2000], aimed to encourage producers take responsibility for the entire life-cycle of their products, thus leading to more eco-friendly products. Nonetheless, EPR schemes do not guarantee circularity and may instead be designed around fees to finance waste management in linear economy models [@christiansenExtendedProducerResponsibility2021]. The French EPR scheme was upgraded in 2020 to become more circular [@jacquesvernierExtendedProducerResponsibility2021]. In July 2024, Latvia was the 4th EU country to join an textile-EPR scheme [@NewEPRRequirements2024]. Strong consumer protection legislation (such as EPR) has a direct influence on producers' actions. For example, in [@hktdcresearchFranceExpandsProducer2022], the Hong Kong Trade Development Council notified textile producers in July 2022 reminding factories to produce to French standards in order to be able enter the EU market. 

The success of EPR can vary per type of product. For car tires, the EPR scheme in the Netherlands claims a 100% recovery rate [@campbell-johnstonHowCircularYour2020]. [@pengExtendedProducerResponsibility2023] finds that the *Carbon Disclosure Project* has been a crucial tool to empower ERP in Chinese auto-producers.

-   One type of legislation that works?

-   [@steenmansFosteringCircularEconomy2023] Argues for the need to engage companies through legislation and shift from waste-centered laws to *product design regulations*.

-   In Europe, there's large variance between member states when in comes to textile recycling: while Estonia and France are the only EU countries where separate collection of textiles is required by law, in Estonia 100% of the textiles were burned in an incinerator in 2018 while in France textiles are covered by an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme leading to higher recovery rates (Ibid).

Packaging is a rapidly growing industry, expanding on the back of online shopping, which generates large amounts of waste materials, which if not reused or recycled, easily becomes garbage. Over 161 million tonnes of plastic packaging is produced every year [@bradleyLiteratureReviewAnalytical2023]. Already more than a decade ago, [@DetailrichSustainablePackaging2010]proposed a database of green packaging to compare hundreds of sustainable packaging materials and guide designers through environmental, performance, and cost trade-offs in one unified tool, in order to help producers choose better packaging - yet the problem is far from solved. More recently, [@bradleyLiteratureReviewAnalytical2023] developed an analytical framework of key sustainability factors, from an overview of 107 studies on reusable packaging, finding customer acceptance, high return rates, supply-chain shortening, and system standardisation, as the key factors critical to unlocking reusable packaging solutions at scale. A survey by PMMI, the Association for Packaging and Processing Technologies, among industry professional, found legacy equipment, higher material costs, and supply consistency as the top barriers to sustainable packaging; in turn, vital enablers were clear vendor guidance, proven material and quipment solutions, and customer demand [@ChallengesOpportunitiesSustainable2022]. In response to legacy equipment issues, [@SulapacReplacingPlastic] a large producer of packaging, has proposed a wood-based, microplastic-free composites to serve as drop-in replacements for plastics; a material even compatible with existing molding, extrusion, and thermoforming production lines, while slashing cradle-to-gate CO₂ emissions and preventing microplastic pollution.

In food packaging specifically, [@adaChallengesCircularFood2023] identified distinct challenges from consumer acceptance to material-supply mismatches, collection logistics, and regulatory gaps, underscoring the multifaceted barriers to circular food packaging. Over 85% of companies in the "protein industry": meat, poultry, seafood, and alternative proteins have some type of sustainability inititive [@ProteinBrandsConsumers2022]. Yet, having sustainability programs does not make a company sustainable, case in point being Coca Cola in the beverage industry. [@lernerHowCocaColaUndermines2019] describes Coca Cola's plastic pollution problem, based on leaked audio, how Coca-Cola was exposed for lobbying against container-deposit laws, aiming to misrepresented recycling as a complete solution; strategies that stalled effective legislation and maintained a “green” façade despite obstructing real sustainability progress.

The "Plastic Waste Makers Index" report lists large corporations which produce plastic waste globally and provides some useful statistics: single-use plastic rose by 6 million tonnes from 2019 to 2021, while just 3 million tonnes of recycling capacity was planned by 2027 (as of the report date, 2023); in total, single-use plastic generated 450 million tonnes of CO2 emissions per year; up to 98% of the single-use plastic was produced from virgin pertrochemicals, while 2% was from recyled material; meanwhile in Taiwan, tje Far Eastern New Century company boosted recycled content from 2% to 11% per cent in 2021 and plans to double its recycling capacity [@minderoofoundationPlasticWasteMakers2023].

### Scenario-Building: Avoiding the Worst Futures

Scenario-building is a key tool for sustainability. Because sustainability is so complex, sustainable design cannot always predict certain outcomes - instead, it can make use of scenarios to prepare for several possibilities. In sustainability, there are rarely good choices. Rather it's a question of avoiding the worst choices. 

One existing tool, which has been widely used is the En-ROADS climate change solutions simulator; governments, organizations and individuals around the world have used it explore climate scenarios based on interactive changes and visualizations [@czaikaModelUseSustainability2017; @creutzigEngageDonPreach2020; @climateinteractiveLIVECOP28EnROADS2023; @climateinteractiveEnROADSOnlineSimulator]. Likewise, [@RooneyVargaClimateActionSimulation2019] shows the effectiveness of *The Climate Action Simulation* in educating users about *success scenarios*. *Life Cycle Assessment* and *Environmental Impact Analysis* are another set of useful tools to provide eco-design scenarios [@DELAPUENTEDIAZDEOTAZU2022718].

Across several case studies, [@fabrisCLIMATECHANGEQUALITY2022] discusses vulnerable sectors from agriculture to transport, under threat from extreme weather events, such as floods, heatwaves, droughts, and storms impact human health: societal development and economic growth should be realistic on planning for weather-related impacts.

### Design for Quality of Life

While traditional economic thinking is based on a conflict between nature and development, some new models find there is potential for synergy between economic, social, political, cultural, and environmental metrics. [@kaklauskasSynergyClimateChange2023] models multi-criteria analysis of 169 countries and 238 cities, finding 71% average correlation between Climate Change and Country Success (C3S) and Quality of Life (C3QL) indicators. In a similar vein, [@riegerIntegratedScienceWellbeing2023] develops an integrated science of wellbeing, linking humans' psychological, biological, societal and environmental domains to guide research and public policy, based on interactions between domain experts.

Wellbeing Economy Governments is an example of country-level collaboration in sharing expertise on sustainable development, looking to bring post growth strategies and policy frameworks to the mainstream. The concept of a wellbeing economy focuses on human and ecological wellbeing rather than material growth since 2018 and includes Finland, Iceland, New Zealand, Scotland, Wales, and Canada as founding members of the network [@fioramontiWellbeingEconomyEffective2022].

For example, there's ample evidence from several countries suggesting moving to renewal energy brings environmental benefits. In Bangladesh, [@AMIN2022113224] suggests *"removing fossil fuel subsidies and intra-sectoral electricity price distortions coupled with carbon taxes provides the highest benefits"* for both the economy and the environment. In other words, green energy was a win-win solution, for both the evironmental health and financial wealth.

Sustainability policy context is shifting around the world. I was torn whether to place *politics* under *sustainability* or *design*, and decided for the latter - as sustainability is mostly *descriptive*, using science to measure and present the real situation, while design is *prescriptive*: codifying decisions about how do we live - in products and services. Design *is* political.

-   @paterPoliticsDesignNot2021


-   Mitigating Climate Change vs Adapting to Climate Change. Many companies are developing technologies for mitigation. 10 countries use almost 100% renewable energy. Taxes. There have been proposal of a "meat tax". Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. Montreal protocol near-eradication of chlorofluorocarbons (CfCs) and the ozone holes became whole again.

[@popkovaTheoryDigitalTechnology2022] argues that SDGs need to discussed in their totality and uses factor analysis to link SDGs to institutions and digital technologies; findings include SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) progress through institutions in developed countries and are most impacted by digital technologies and digital knowledge index, meanwhile SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) makes the most headway in developing countries, which are starting from a lower base. Likewise, the German Institute of Development and Sustainability (IDOS) has built a tool to connect SDGs and their 169 targets to NDCs (Nationally Determined Contributions), looking for synergies for effective climate action plans and sustainable development strategies, visualizing a clear skew which SDGs receive the most climate‐related commitments - SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy); meanwhile SDG 14 (Life Below Water), and the SDG 3 social goals discussed above, SDG 4 (Quality Education) and SDG 5 (Gender Equality), are the least adressed to climate plans [@dzeboParisAgreementSustainable2023].

Eco-Design is about improving processes and optimizing resources. While the goal of reducing harm is shared, the specifics will depend on the industry. [@VANDOORSSELAER2022189] Defines ecodesign as "design for X" in a circular economy, thinking through the life cycle of a product, tools, materials, production, use, and end-of-life phases.

In wine-making, [@MANZARDO2021149507] presents an Italian vinery case study, where a redesigned Merlot red wine procedure reduced in environmental impacts from fuel and pesticide use in vineyards; the 8-step procedure included calculating the product's environmental footprint and following the ISO 14006 standard, titled *"Environmental management systems — Guidelines for incorporating ecodesign"*. Finding uses for by-products, can improve sustainability even more. [@INARRA2022100727] designed a circular scheme for brewery left-overs, producing feed ingredients for aquaculture; in a further step, using life-cycle assessment (LCA) and optimising logistics, reduced the aquafeed's environmental footprint also by 6%.

In architecture and the built environment, [@MUNARO2022566] conducted a comprehensive reviews of ecodesign 288 articles, identifying *Design for Adaptability* and *Disassembly* as the most inclusive strategies, coining a new term DfAD; a framework linking DfAD with lifecycle assessment tools is a promising are for research to support sustainable construction.

In pharmaceuticals, [@BASSANI2022151565] proposes an approach to eco-design using life-cycle assessment: optimizing packaging types, alternative materials, transport, and weight reduction. A follow-up study from the same group in 2023 extended the eco-design to a full cradle-to-grave assessment and evaluated end-of-life alternatives [@bassaniLifeCycleAssessment2024].

In the printing industry, [@MIYOSHI2022267] takes the example of ink toner bottles and applies Life Cycle Simulation to show in a case study how standardized compatibility between older and newer systems can save resources and results in sustainability savings, highlighting how remanufacturing is an important strategy in circularity for reducing CO₂ emissions and life cycle costs.

While these examples underline the industry-specifity of eco-design, some authors attempt to come up with mores holistics approaches. For instance [@RUIZPASTOR2022130495] developed "CN_Con", a metric for conceptual design, trying to measure circularity and novelty in conjuction, by analysing product functions, durability, material origins, and end-of-life, while at the same time supporting creative and circular design solutions in early stages.

On an international level, looking at companies operating on the European Single Market, [@ARRANZ2022131738] conducted a large-scale study using machine learning on firm survey data from 870 organisations across diverse economic sectors, aqcuired from the 2015 EU Public Consultation on the Circular Economy conducted by European Commission, comparing coercive pressures (regulations, subsidies, grants), normative pressures (industry standards, professional networks), and mimetic pressures (competitive imitation), finding normative and mimetic pressure only enhance sustainability, if coercive pressure already exists - i.e. regulations are a key point of leverage. In summary, enacting laws which support sustainability can shift complex systems with many parties towards a circular economy, and be enhanced by additional voluntary forces. However, a comparative analysis of OECD green growth indicators for the periods 2004–2005 and 2019 across EU member states found that green transformation do not correlate directly with development level - instead each country’s unique socio-economic context plays a role: governance quality and income distribution shape the effectiveness of regulatory frameworks, suggesting that coercive policies must be tailored to national circumstances in order to reinforce circular-economy adoption at scale[@CHEBA2022108601].

## Thinking in Systems to Re-Design Industries or Provenance and Traceability

As of 2025, *circular economy* is a tiny part of the world economy. [@circleeconomyCircularityGapReport2022] reported in 2022 only 8.6% of world economy was circular and *100B tonnes of virgin materials* was sourced every year. An early pioneering innovator, [@jacksonMaterialConcernsPollution1996] showed through detailed case studies how *preventive environmental management*, redesigning industrial production at the source can avert pollution, laying the conceptual groundwork for today’s circular-economy models. Many companies are investing into transforming their processes. *"\[T\]ransition to a low carbon economy presents challenges and potential economic benefits that are comparable to those of previous industrial revolutions"* [@pearsonLowCarbonIndustrial2012].

Futurists and visionaries adept at naming things have already listed the 5th, 6th, and even the 7th industrial revolution, pointing at robotics, quantum computing, nanotechnology, and more, looking at current trends and building scenarios for 2050 to envisioning a world with convergence of bio-based and mineral-based technologies, widespread sustainability, and energy-abundance [@chourasiaSustainabilityIndustryGlobal2022; @ruizestradaSeventhIndustrialRevolution2024]. If indeed, we're in an industrial revolution, it's possible to re-design entire industries, and that is exactly the expectation sustainability sets on businesses. Across all industries, there's a call for more transparency. Conversations about sustainability are too general and one needs to look at the specific sustainability metrics at specific industries to be able to design for meaningful interaction. There's plentiful domain-specific research showing how varied industries can develop eco-designed products.

I use the lens of *sustainability* - a complex term - to look at how design can contribute to eco-friendly products, advocating a diverse set design methods as a toolbox, where one can pick a suitable tool to match the problem. While AI allows us to look at a larger number of design scenarios than previously feasible, there are many approaches to design for sustainability, with varied design practices that may be relevant at different times in the process. Designing for sustainability is fundamentally a hopeful act, imbibed with the belief that a healthier world is possible - because health and sustainability are intrinsically connected.

*Eco-Design*, *Circular Design*, *Design for Circularity, Cradle-to-Cradle Design*, *Green Design*, *Regenerative Design*, *Climate-Responsive Design*, *Life-Centered Design, Design for Human Rights, Multispecies Design, Designing for Health* - designing for sustainability has been called with many names in diverse contexts of use, using a diversity of approaches, with subtle differences of emphasis and nuance, with same general goal of being more sustainable. While EU legislation chose *Eco-Design* as the overarching title, researchers and practitioners discuss all of the above on a frequent basis. [@ceschinEvolutionDesignSustainability2016] gives a comprehensive overview of the main themes of sustainable design and the main contributions and limitations in the well–researched *"Evolution of design for sustainability: From product design to design for system innovations and transitions"*.

```{python}
dfs_history()
```

As this research is *practice-oriented* (i.e., my goal here is to find design approaches that could influence my prototype), I will focus on some fields of design which I hope relevant, fruitful, or contextual to my project.

I will start with *Human-Centered Design*, the grandfather of design with attitude. There's even an ISO standard for human-centered design, with the designated code ISO9241-210, revised as ISO 9241-210:2019 titled *"Ergonomics of human-system interaction"* and up for revision soon (ISO standards are reviewed every 5 years). Some of the key takeaways include "Understanding and specifying the context of use", "Involving users throughout design and development", "Specifying user requirements", "Evaluating designs", "Multi-disciplinary Collaboration", "Iterative process" and "Continual Improvement", and finally - usability is not enough, the design should provide a user experience (UX) for human "emotional responses and satisfaction" [@isoHumancentredDesignInteractive2019].

While *Human-Centered Design* focuses exactly on what it says - humans - *Life-Centered Design* recognizes human impact on our surrounding environment as well - making sure we include non-human animals among our stakeholders. This is where we are getting on the *territory* of sustainability. While *Human-Centered Design* is ever popular, the effect humans are having on biodiversity is rarely considered when designing. *"\[T\]he design phase of a physical product accounts for 80% of its environmental impact"* notes[@borthwickHumancentredLifecentredDesign2022] in their framework for life-centered design. If we're including *other* lifeforms among our stakeholders, what can we learn from them? *Biomimicry* is about being inspired by nature while *Biodesign* focuses on design involving biology in the design itself. Janine Benyus, who coined the word *Biomimicry* [@benyusBiomimicryInnovationInspired2009] looks at very practical cases of innovation where engineers and biologist meet and [@dicksBiomimicryRevolutionLearning2023] provides a much more philosophical account of following the example of nature. Focusing on the financial sector, [@thomasDesignFinancialSustainability2022]'s philosophical account advocates for an "inside-out" design pattern, much like natural systems, starting from the smallest structures to guarantee resilience and survival, instead of trying to control their external environment. In a similar vein, *Material Ecology* is the wording preferred by the architect Neri Oxman based at the MIT Media Lab working with biomaterials as a proponent of *Nature-Centric Design* that adheres to the principles of ecological sustainability with both an ecologically conscious mindset and practical toolset [@henczNeriOxmanMaterial2022]. Language and our mental concepts shape our reality, which makes language-creation an important tool for sustainability. Neri Oxman's expressions in her [@worldeconomicforumBioInspiredDesignNeri2016] interview introduce some new vocabulary: *"ecology-indifferent"*, *"naturing"*, *"mother naturing"*, *"design is a practice of letting go of all that is unnecessary"*, *"nature should be our single client"*, which reminds me how self-invented language gives un child-like freedom to imagine new worlds.

*Regenerative Design* suggests *de*materializing (digitizing) economies is not enough to be sustainable (by reduction of physical impact). Design should look beyond reducing harm and find avenues to *regenerate* damaged or even completely destroyed natural systems – ecosystems, biodiversity, land, forests, lakes, rivers - natural habitats.

*Multi-Species Design* refers to the idea of considering non-human life-forms as stakeholders of our design. [@metcalfeMULTISPECIESDESIGN2015]'s PhD Disseration titled *"The devastating effects that unsustainable design practices have on the natural world and other species with whom we share this planet"* gives a good overview of the work done is this branch of design. In a similar vein, *Biodiversity Inclusive Design (BID)*, developed by [@hernandez-santinIntegratingBiodiversityNonhuman2023] through a systematic review of 14 design frameworks, presents a *'participatory ladder for non-humans'*; including core design principles that position species’ needs within urban planning to achieve a biodiversity-positive multi-species environment. Multi-species design and participatory design can work together. [@haldrupDesigningMultispeciesCommons2022] examines how participatory design can include non-human species as co-creators of the urban commons; drawing on cases from Copenhagen, Denmark and the Viskan River (in the textile town, Borås, Sweden), the authors highlight sensory and aesthetic encounters, and attempts to perceive the agency of non-human species in a collaborative design processes [@theuniversityofmelbourneaustraliaMultispeciesCohabitationFuture2020]. Multi-Species Design has also entered the art-world thanks to [@marcusMultispeciesMaterialitiesCohabitation2023] who uses artworks to think about how material design strategies, surface textures, substrates, and bio-inspired composites, can foster biodiversity and interspecies cohabitation in the built environment. A very practical example helps one visualize this field the best. [@kosovaBioGeoEcotileImproving2023] introduces the BioGeo Ecotile, a eco-engineering tile combining pits, holes, grooves, and crevices to mimic natural rocky shores and provide multi-species living-environments; deployed on rock armour and flood walls along Edinburgh’s coast in Scotland, Ecotiles supported significantly higher intertidal species richness compared to smooth tiles, helping animals make a life there. [@selvanMultispeciesBuildingEnvelopes2023] goes deep into data modeling multi-variate calculations on how to build buildings, which support ecology, coming up with a general framework for the architecture of building envelopes, that resulted in 20% higher local species richness and up to 77% higher abundance for individual species.

In most cases, designing for sustainability makes use of *systems thinking*, underlining the importance of looking at the entire life-cycle of a product or service. [@ROSSI2022823] shows how introducing sustainability early in the design process and providing scenarios where sustainability is a metric, it's possible to achieve more eco-friendly designs. Yet, calculating what's sustainable is hugely complex because decisions may have unforeseen ramifications. To take a single example [@NUEZ2022133252] shows how electric vehicles may increase CO~2~ emissions in some areas, such as Canary Islands, where electricity production is polluting. In sum, sustainable design encompasses all human activities, making this pursuit an over-arching challenge across all industries and all human activities with the complex interdependence contained within these interactions. [@engkvistWhyArenThere2024] calls for *Design Sociology*, design should take account the product's effect on society, giving the example of highly individualized understanding of individualized psychology and dopamine cycles for creating social media, while disregarding the societal effects, such as spread of misinformation. Lack of sustainability in the design process is a *bug* in the design approach.

*Service Design*, [@ceschinEvolutionDesignSustainability2016] shows how design for sustainability has expanded from a product focus to systems-thinking focus placing the product inside a societal context of use. For example [@CargoBikeFREITAG], recycled clothing maker FREITAG offers sustainability-focused services such as cargo bikes so you can transport your purchases and a network for *shopping without payment* = swapping your items with other members, as well as repairs of their products. Loaning terminology from *service design*, the user journey within an app needs to consider each touchpoint on the way to a state of success. *Designing for Trust*, @weinschenk100ThingsEvery2011 says *"People expect most online interactions to follow the same social rules as person-to-person interactions. It's a shortcut that your brain uses to quickly evaluate trustworthiness."*

*Speculative Design* can also help us imagine *non-anthropocentric* [@hupkesShiftingNonanthropocentrismDialogue2022; @edwardsSpeculativeDesignEnvisioning2023] as well as *dystopian* futures [@pintoCreationDystopiasAlternative2021]. First introduced by [@dunneSpeculativeEverythingDesign2013] in their seminal book, the field aims to question the intersection of *user experience design* and *speculative fiction*. [@BARENDREGT2021374] explores the potential of speculative design to stimulate public engagement; thought experiments can spur public debate on an issue chosen by the designer. Phil Balagtas, founder of The Design Futures Initiative at McKinsey, discusses the value of building future scenarios at his talk at Google. His favorite example, the Apple Knowledge Navigator, first appeared in an Apple vision video in 1987 and took two decades to materialize in the real world. It was inspired by a similar device first shown in a 1970s episode of Star Trek as a *magic device* (a term from participatory design), which then inspired subsequent consumer product development. It took another two decades, until the launch of the iPhone in 2007 - a total of 40 years. Iteration has been the mainstay of software design, incrementally improving the user experience, through a continuous feedback loop; yet speculative design can help explore and imagine possible futures by manifesting them in stories, artifacts, and scenarios, empowering stakeholders to prepare for challenges and shape policy, as well as ethical frameworks, beyond strictly product-centered thinking [@googledesignDesignSpeculativeFutures2019].

*Participatory Design* and *Speculative Design* can be complementary as in the work of [@neuhoffFormsParticipatoryFuturing2023], used together to focus on engaging users deep in the design process to truly understand their needs, contexts and interactions on a non-superficial level. For both speculative and participatory design, the cost and makes it into a niche activity. Generative AI holds the promise to allow designers to dream up and prototype quicker. In order to build a future, it's relevant to imagine and critique a future. By being quickly generate prototypes, once can test out ideas with the future users involving more of the community and stakeholders. To be able to build something, one first needs to imagine it; imagination is crucial for change. Speculative Design helps us envision future scenarios and be critical of the current reality, by taking an alternative view-point. A related field, *Design Fiction*, goes even further by creating narratives and artifacts that immerse participants in detailed visions of possible futures, blending storytelling and tangible experiences. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is a source of many fantastic innovations, used to host The Design Fiction group (from September 2013 to May 2018), which designed projects to *"stimulate discussion about the social, cultural, and ethical implications of emerging technologies"*, coming up with design such as a Brain-Controlled Interface for Spermatozoa, the Human Perfume, capturing the smell of the people significant to the author, as well as Pop Roach, for designing edible cockroaches [@liuOverviewBrainControlledInterface2017; @designfictiongroupGroupOverviewDesign2018].

Moving from products and (digital) experiences towards the built environment and architecture, *Climate-Responsive Design* embeds a building within the environmental constraints of a place and looks for opportunities use the land, wind, sun, local materials, and local vernacular history and culture when considering a design. Architect Susanne Brorson suggests sustainability should be considered in the earlier phases of design instead of trying to fix problems later, discussing *climate-responsive design principles* [@evmmaaarhitektuurikeskusClimateresponsiveDesignPrinciples2019]. The sentiment is echoed by [@leeAestheticsSustainableArchitecture2011] who edited a volume on sustainable approaches of world-renowned architects: *"The principles of sustainable design are rooted in the building’s relationship to the site and its environmental conditions such as topography, vegetation, and climate."* The pioneering book *Architecture of the Well-Tempered Environment* laid out ideas for integrating environmental concerns as part of architecture already in 1980s [@banhamArchitectureWelltemperedEnvironment1999].

*Cradle-to-Cradle Design* uses systems thinking focusing on the reuse, re-manufacturing, and finally - recyclability - of products. The Taiwanese Design Research Institute (TDRI) hosted a Nordic Circular Design Forum in Taipei, where Scandinavian circular design practicioners shared projects from several industries, highlighting how design requires building relationships; it's not feasible to create a sustainable product by oneself, as it takes a whole ecosystem [@TaiWanSheJiYanJiuYuanTDRIInstagram2021; @tdriBeiOuXunHuanSheJiLunTanNordicCircular2021]. *Durability* is an important dimension for sustainability. High quality durable products are more sustainable as they last longer and less likely to be thrown away. Forming an emotional bond with the product makes it feel more valuable [@zonneveldEmotionalConnectionsObjects2014]. [@chapmanDesignEmotionalDurability2009] argues in his seminal paper (and later in his book) for *"Emotionally Durable Design"*, the simple idea that we hold to things we value and thus they are sustainable. We don't throw away a necklace gifted to us by mom, indeed this object might be passed down for centuries. [@roseEnchantedObjectsInnovation2015] has a similar idea, where *"Enchanted Objects"* become so interlinked with us, we're unlikely to throw them away. This has implications for sustainability as the object is less likely to be thrown away.

As the above shows, there are many partially overlapping design words created by different people for diverse purposes. Design vocabulary may be created for distinguishing a particular type of design from another - or to market oneself as the creator of the word. There are designers who define / brand themselves by their design method. Design Studies, a field that studies *design* as a subject.

## Student Essentials: Consumer Goods, Clothes and Food

Food, clothes, and consumer goods (I'm omitting housing and transport here) are part of the immediate environmental impact of college students. I will here focus on 3 industries that are relevant for college students.

### Fast-Moving Consumer Goods

Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) also known as Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) are large global congloremates operating with low margins and high volumes [@tohFastForwardEverything2024]. The largest of them have several billions in revenue [@kentonFastMovingConsumerGoods2024]. Rise of e-commerce has pushed logistics companies to increase delivery efficiency to keep up with FMCG sales [@deliverectDeliverectUSWhat2024].

```{python}
fast_consumer_goods()
```

In China, while there are signs of young Chinese consumers valuing experiences over possessions, the raw sales growth numbers show consumerism is only increasing [@jiangHowHaveCovid2023; @zhangCulturalConsumptionChinese2025; @claudio-quirogaPersistenceChinasHousehold2025; @huiChineseConsumptionNew2025].

### (Fast) Fashion Industry

Just like Fast-Moving Consumer Goods, fast fashion operates with low margins and follows consumer trends. Young people are the largest consumers of fast fashion [@YoungConsumersComplicated]. [In @europeanenvironmentagencyTextilesEnvironmentRole2022 European Environment Agency (EEA)] estimates based on trade and production data that EU27 citizens consumed an average 15kg of textile products per person per year. [@textileexchangeFASHIONINDUSTRYTRADE2021] Fashion industry revenue is above USD 1.5 trillion; COP26 policy calls for 45% cut in emissions by 2030. The European Commission wants to reduce the impact of fast fashion on EU market [@errKomisjonTahabVahendada2022]. There are also other local policy initiatives aiming to tackle the waste problem. For example the New Standard Institute's proposed *"Fashion Act"* to require brands doing business in New York City to disclose sustainability data and set waste reduction targets [@emilychanWill2022Be2022]. In California, the *"Garment Worker Protection Act”* covers 45000 garment workers with wage and safety safeguards [@LilyMindfulActive].

In terms of total figures, the 2.4 Trillion USD fashion industry contributes 2%-8% of total global green house gas (GHG emissions); 100B USD is lost to lack of recycling; contributes 9% of microplastics [@adamkiewiczGreenwashingSustainableFashion2022]. [@NewStandardInstitute] similary estimates the apparel & footwear account for \> 8 % of global GHG and could rise up to 60% by 2030.\
[@centobelliSlowingFastFashion2022] reports fashion industry year uses 9B cubic meters of water, 1.7B tonnes of CO~2~, 92 million tonnes of textile waste. [@emilychanWillFashionIndustry2022] as things stand now, fashion companies can't be held accountable for their actions (or indeed, their lack of action), driving calls for extended producer responsibility. [@kohlerCircularEconomyPerspectives2021] Globally 87% of textile products are burned or landfilled after 1st consumer use. [@millward-hopkinsMaterialFlowAnalysis2023] shows how 50% of the textile waste in the UK is exported to other countries, often to be dumped as trash in landfills or burned. [@tianmacleodjiFastFashionDominates2024] found fast fashion propels 26 million tons of clothing in China’s landfills annually. In Ghana, research across several dumpsites revealed up to 12% of the landfill consisted of textile waste [@gyabaahCharacterizationDumpsiteWaste2023]. The [@CleanClothesCampaign] decries how *"\[t\]he mainstream fashion industry is built upon the exploitation of labor, natural resources and the knowledge of historically marginalized peoples"*; in 2018, 3/5 of the 100 billion garments produced globally ended up in landfill within one year of sale. [@fashioncheckerFashionCheckerWagesTransparency2023] reports none of the top global apparel brands pays a living wage; 60% of garment workers are women earning below-men wages. Yet, for certain countries this production is crucial; the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association reports 24% annual growth in global market and makes up a whopping 81% of the exports of the country [@BGMEAHome; @dailysunBangladeshRegains2nd2022]. 

It's hard to make improvements to a system in an opaque environment. [@emilychanWeStillDon2022] writes there's not enough transparency in the fashion industry - greenwashing is prevalent - and introduces Fashion Revolution's Fashion Transparency Index, in order to tackle the very issues mentioned above [@fashionrevolutionfoundationFASHIONTRANSPARENCYINDEX2022]. Similarly, [@wikirateSharingDataCreating2022] presents itself thus: *"Among the Index's main goals are to help different stakeholders to better understand what data and information is being disclosed by the world's largest fashion brands and retailers, raise public awareness, educate citizens about the social and environmental challenges facing the global fashion industry and support people's activism"*. Already in 2018, Sourcemap launched the "Open Apparel Registry", a crowd-sourced digital map of apparel factories, creating a standardised database of factory names and addresses to enhance supply-chain transparency [@mowbrayWorldFirstFree2018]. Sustainable fashion company evaluations platform Good On You rated 5821 brands in 2023; yet most large labels with climate targets publish no progress data [@goodonyouGoodYouSustainable2023]. The Fossil-Free Fashion Scorecard graded 43 brands; 15 scored "F" and the sector average was a "D" [@stand.earthStandEarthPeople2023]. Making use of these indexes, YouTuber [@imperfectidealistSustainableGreenwashingHow2020] proposes a 7-step checklist to help consumers spot greenwashing, focused on transparency, such as if the producer has published a full list of suppliers. While consumer understanding of sustainability is growing, it's not neccesarily very specific; for example [@mabuzaNaturalSyntheticDyes2023] shows consumer knowledge of the effects of apparel coloration is very limited. 

Nonetheless, change is happening. Qima, a company which provides inspection and certification services for the fashion industry, found that in 2023 inspection demand for products coming from China rose 5.4% year-on-year, specifically 13% from the US, 27% from Germany, 32% from the UK, and 69 % from Mexico, demonstrating the global nature of the business, while *near-shoring* and *re-shoring* accounted for 10% of the U.S. and EU-based buyers’ procurement, underscoring the growing need for supply chain visibility and adaptability [@qimaGlobalSupplyChain2024]. One example of a blockchain-based fibre-to-garment traceability solution, live with 100+ brands, is [@TextileGenesis]; other blockchain-based approaches are discussed at length in a dedicated section.

There's a growing know-how on how to design sustainable fashion and which materials to use; for instance the *"Handbook of Footwear Design and Manufacture"* includes a special chapter on green design specifically for shoes [@leungGreenDesign2021]. The "Circular Design HOW" toolkit launched 2021 to guide Baltic designers in cradle-to-cradle approaches for circular textiles [@eestidisainikeskusiestoniandesigncentreCircularDesignHOW2021]. Estonian Academy of Arts' sustainable fashion open course reached 9 European universities in 2022, covering eco-materials and ethical sourcing [@eestikunstiakadeemiaEKAArendasEuroopa2022]. And certainly there are many more examples globally.

However, for ethical fashion practices to reach scale, materials do matter a lot. [@textileexchangeTextileExchange2023] reports global fibre output reached 116 million tonnes in 2022; polyester alone was 54% percent of the total. Access to better materials is crucial and industry collaboration can raise the bar for everyone, such as the Better Cotton Initiative [@bettercottonBetterCottonAnnual2023]. One example of an ethical brand is [@SheepIncSoftcore2023], which promises to sequester 14kg of CO₂e per kg of wool (footprint per finished sweater is 0.04 kg CO₂e), by using wool from Merino sheep with regenerative practices. Robert Gentz, the Co-CEO and co-founder of Zalando, a large European online retailer, says fast fashion must disappear within the next decade (citing 40% of wardrobes are never worn), launching a separate brand caled Zign, built around sustainable materials and ethical production practices, with at least 20% recycled content and 50% eco-friendly materials per item [@storbeckFastFashionMust2021; @remingtonZalandoZignLabel2020]. Improved technology for recycling is in the pipeline; for example [@infinitedfiberInfinitedFiber2023; @karilaInfinitedFiberProject2024] produces a premium fiber called Infinna, using its pulp-to-fibre recycling tech, from waster materials - and is being used by sustainable brands such as Patagonia.

The story of Patagonia has inspired many to see that a financially successful, eco-friendly fashion business is a possibility; yet Patagonia’s 1 % for the Planet pledge that has delivered about USD 140 million to grassroots environmental groups since 1985, seems like a drop in the bucket compare to the scale of the problem [@chouinardLetMyPeople2005]. The "Generation Rewear" documentary documents the strides newer sustainable fashion brands are making; yet a survey made for the film showed 64% of UK consumers wear items only once, leading to 350000 Tonnes of clothing landfilled yearly [@vanishukGENERATIONREWEARFull2021].

Digital Product Passports will be mandatory for fashion under EU Eco-design and EPR rules between 2026 and 2030, enabling ethical shopping [@TransparencySustainabilityPlatform2023]. New apps make alterations and repairs made easy: SOJO door-to-Door service raised USD 2.4 million pre-seed funding for a clohtes repairs service, cutting waste and emissions [@SOJODoortodoorClothing2023].

### Food

Food production is a large greenhouse gas emitter. "The agricultural sector contributes to approximately 13.5% of the total global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and accounts for 25% of the total CO~2~ emission" [@nabipourafrouziComprehensiveReviewCarbon2023]. [@pooreReducingFoodEnvironmental2018] suggests 26% of carbon emissions come from food production. @FoodPrints2015 reports dairy (46%) and meat and fish (29%) products making up the largest GHG emission potential. @springmannGlobalRegionalCosts2021 proposes veganism is the most effective decision to reduce personal CO~2~ emissions.

Re-designing the industrial food systems for an increasing global population is a challenge - yet improvements are possible at every step of the way. For example, an Italian retail supermarkets worried about their carbon footprint ran a pilot program, which cut food + packaging waste emissions from 436 kg CO₂e to 339 kg CO₂e per store per year (total 22% emissions reduction) [@marrucciImprovingCarbonFootprint2020]. Perennial (multi-year) crops are less carbon intentsive, reducing inputs of gasoline, labor, etc [@aubreystreitkrugPathwaysPerennialFood2023], yet large agritech companies like Monsanto rely on selling seeds annually for profits putting them at odds with perennial crops; single-year seeds have led to farmer suicides when crops fail in poor communities.

Supply chain innovation in food industries may enable more transparency. Provenance and traceability of food has implications for sustainability and health. Food fraud is a contentius issue which requires new science- and legislation-based solutions. One example is *fake honey*, meaning synthetic honey, or actual honey fraudulently blended with cheaper sugar syrup, which can pass some laboratorty tests, requiring improved technology, such as DNA-analysis to find real honey [@errEstonianBeekeepersMaintain2023; @songDetectionAdulterationChinese2020]. China is the world's largest honey producer, making about 24% of world total [@FAOSTATHoney2023] and has been implicated in tampering with their product. Apimondia, the International Federation of Beekeepers’ Associations, canceled its annual honey award because of wide-spread supply-chain fraud, as they were unable to guarantee the authenticity of honey [@ungoed-thomasBeekeepersHaltHoney2024]. The same is true for cocoa beans, which are at high risk from food fraud [@fanningLinkingCocoaQuality2023]. *Farm to Fork* is a European Union policy to *shorten the supply chain* (meaning less change for fraud) from the producer to the consumer and add transparency to the system [@financialtimesSustainabilityIdeasThat2022].

Complex supply chains make seafood (marine Bivalvia, mollusks) logistics especially prone to fraud, leading to financial losses and threats to consumer health [@santosCurrentTrendsTraceability2023]. [@changAuthenticationFishSpecies2021] *fish fraud* is a large global problem but it's possible to use DNA-tracking to prove where the fish came from. In "2019, the 27 KURA SUSHI branches in Taiwan sold more than 46 million plates of sushi. in Taiwan". Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IIU) fishing is widespread; the EU is adopting countermeasures [@kimEconomicImpactsEuropean2024]. [@munozCarbonFootprintEconomic2023] Is there such a thing as sustainable fishing? Bottom trawling is the worst and should be banned. [@katiegustafsonWhyTracingSeafood2022] proposes a *"Uniform traceability system for the entire supply chain"* for seafood. [@mamedeElementalFingerprintingSea2022] proposes *Seafood tracing*: Fingerprinting of Sea Urchin.

Global warming leading to droughts and extreme weather, wars and conflicts increased volatility in food prices [@eshenelsonHeatWarTrade2023].

[@patelBlockchainTechnologyFood2023] livestock products (meat) are 15% of agricultural foods valued at €152 billion in 2018 globally.

**Culture, Community, Cuisine, Storytelling**

Culture can be a proponent of sustainability. Food is about enticing human imagination and taste buds. Potato used to be a newcomer and innovative crop in Europe, and now it's so common, Europeans forget it's no originally from Europe. Food is also about cuisine and culture; foods become popular if we hear stories and see cuisine around a particular crop [@aubreystreitkrugPathwaysPerennialFood2023].

**Food Waste**

There are several initiatives to reduce food waste by helping people consume food that would otherwise be throw away including Olio and Too Good To Go.

## In Practice Sustainability Begins in Software

Humans live in artificial environments where *most things* are designed by humans. Design encompasses most everything in our daily lives. The *experiences* we take part in are increasingly created based on some type of data. *Digital Sustainability* refers to the idea that *Digital* enables *Sustainability*: information pertaining to emissions would flow through the economy not unlike the carbon cycle itself. 

Designing user interfaces for sustainable interactions means incorporating data and tools to enable designers to make decisions which reduce the emissions of their designs. Software is key to building more sustainable products, already for decades [@guptaAnalysisArtificialIntelligencebased2023]. Increasingly, AI-assisted design is where sustainability begins: AI provides the parameters for sustainability. Companies like AutoDesk have introduced CO~2e~ calculations inside their design software, helping designers reduce material usage, energy consumption, CO~2e~ emissions, while increasing potential for reuse and recyclability [@mikehaleySustainabilityStartsDesign2022]. As AI tools and data quality improve, a increasing number of parameters for deciding the suitable life cycle design, will become available [@singhArtificialNeuralNetwork2023].

[@panArtificialIntelligenceDigital2023] proposes 6 dimensions of *AI* usage in *Digital Sustainability*. The chart is purely illustrative to highlight the value of AI for sustainability; it's not based on numeric metrics.

```{python}
sustainability_ai_six_dimensions()
```

### Data-Driven Design

I believe it's possible to learn from the growth of digital platforms and superapps to see how data-driven design could enable sustainability to become mainstream. Sustainability touches every facet of human existence and is thus an enormous undertaking. Making progress on sustainability is only possible if there's a large-scale coordinated effort by humans around the planet. For this to happen, appropriate technological tools are required.

Digital platforms are focused on *Growth Design*, how to *attract* and *retain* users. Superapps are the latter stage of the economies of digital platforms, where previously vertically targeted apps expand horizontally to provide an ever-increasing number of services. For digital products (including superapps) the main application of interaction design is for *growth* in usage, how to get more people (user journey and conversion funnels) to use the product i.e user acquisition, retention, engagement, and monetization and keep using it (retention and engagement), often optimizing on-boarding, features, and personalization [@stegerDefiningGrowthDesign2019; @kendeDifferenceProductDesign2023].

Platform economy companies popularized and expanded Data-Driven Design in the service of growth marketing (also known colloquially as growth hacking). Capturing User Data was part of this strategy which enabled improving the products. Digital Product Design is increasingly data-driven. Digital platforms operate a *design as a process* in a continuous feedback loop, where *measurements*, *experiments,* predictive analytics and personalization form a data-drive design culture. As we humans go about our daily business, governments and companies track our activities using various technologies, which produces massive amounts of user interaction data.

Platform economy companies are the capture and use large amounts of data from users. Data is useful for designing better products. Designing for high retention (users keep coming back). Network Effects, the more people use a platform, the more valuable it becomes. Platforms that continuously add features (provided consumer legislation allows it) may eventually evolve into superapps, which are useful for providing services for a wide category of human needs. Bundling many services under one super-brand. Superapps are possible thanks to Nudge, Economies of Scale, Network Effects, Behaviour Design. Large Digital Platforms have a very small number of workers relative to the number of users they serve. This creates the necessity for using automation for both understanding user needs and providing the service itself. Creating a good product that's useful for the large majority of users depends on *Data-Driven Design.*

Design is as much about how it works as it's about the interface. There are many approaches to design - from playful to practical to critical and to data-driven. Nonetheless, many types of design share a common goal designing for a good *user experience*. Digital product design can be seen as a specific discipline under the umbrella of Experience Design. In [@michaelabrashInventingFuture2017] Laura Fryer, Meta Oculus augmented reality incubation general manager, said as much: *"People buy experiences, not technology."*

Simplifying.

*Personalization*: the largest businesses today (measured in number of users) design the whole user experience in order to reach *Scale*. Intelligent Interfaces use interaction design to provide relevant and personalized information in the right context and at the right time. Popular consumer platforms strive to design solutions that feel personalized at every touchpoint on the user journey (to use the language of service design) at the scale of hundreds of billions of users. Businesses care about Total addressable market (TAM), serviceable addressable market (SAM), target audience (TA), and use hypothesis and validation for iterating on features, to reach these lofty goals.

- Personalization, Personal User Experience. social apps require personalization, *trust* and *k-factors* (sharing and inviting your friends). [@baronLessonsBuildingViral2023; @kimYouHaveLightning2023].

### Circular Design for a Circular Economy

The bible for Circular Economy, the "Cradle to Grave" book was released over 2 decades ago; change is slow, but change is happening [@mcdonoughCradleCradleRemaking2002].

Circular design is only possible if supply chains become circular as well. [@hedbergCircularEconomyRole2021] argues digitization and data sharing is a requirement for building a circular economy. Yet, sometimes technology fails. Nonetheless, many current technological hurdles can be overcome by supply chain professionals who are experts in connecting supply streams [@dullCircularSupplyChain2021]. [@oikosdenktankWebinarDoughnutEconomics2021] argues circular design requires new skills, one of which is circular material procurement.

To take a specific industry, digitization of mining systems allows enhance the reliability of supply chains, and provides better supply chain transparency [@crmallianceEITRawMaterials2020]. This does not only include tracking the critical raw materials, but also the social aspects surround the mine. While this rarely makes the international media, [@eerolaCorporateConductCommodity2022] maps 20 ongoing mining and mineral-exploration disputes in Finland, calling for systematic dispute monitoring, in order to maintain a social license to operate.

The complexity of resource and delivery networks necessitates more advanced tools to map supply chains [@knightFutureBusinessRole2022]. The COVID19 pandemic - and resulting blockages in resource delivery - highlighted the need to have real-time visibility into supply chains [@finkenstadtBlurryVisionSupply2021]. Moreover, in the context of the EU Plastics Strategy, "the European Commission has launched a pledge to increase the use of recycled content to 10 million tons by 2025".

Already in 2020, a company founded to solve these exact issues, Circularise, and funded in part by the EU Commission H2020 SME Instrument, developed a privacy-focused blockchain-based data exchange protocol for tracing plastics across supply chains, aiming to boost transparency and circularity [@circulariseCirculariseRaisesMillion2020]. Circularise launched an “Open Standard for Sustainability and Transparency” based on blockchain technology & Zero-knowledge Proofs" @circulariseEuPCCircularisePlastics2020. Circularise is currently the market leader in providing *Digital Product Passports* [@strettonDigitalProductPassports2022].

-   *"Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (part of the Sustainable Products Initiative) is one of the key actions under the Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP). The goal of this initiative is to lay the groundwork for a gradual introduction of a digital product passport in at least 3 key markets by 2024" "Connecting the Value Chain, One Product at a Time". "Circularise aims to overcome the communication barrier that is limiting the transition to a circular economy with an open, distributed and secure communications protocol based on blockchain technology."*

It's important in which structure data is stored, affecting the ability to efficiently access and manage the data while guaranteeing a high level of data integrity, security, as well as energy usage of said data. Blockchains are a type of shared database where the data is stored in several locations with a focus on making the data secure and very difficult to modify after it's been written to the database. Once data is written to the blockchain, modifying it would require changing all subsequent records in the chain and agreement of the majority of validators who host a version of the database. Blockchain is the main technology considered for accounting for the various inputs and complex web of interactions between many participants inside the supply chain networks.

Several startups are using to track source material arriving to the factories and product movements from factories to markets and there are hundreds of paper researching blockchain use in supply change operations since 2017 [@duttaBlockchainTechnologySupply2020]. Blockchains enable saving immutable records into distributed databases (also known as ledgers). It's not possible to (or extremely difficult) to change the same record, only new records can be added on top of new ones. Blockchains are useful for data sharing and auditing, as the time and place of data input can be guaranteed, and it will be easier to conduct a search on who inputted incorrect data; however the system still relies on correct data input. As the saying goes, *"garbage in, garbage out"*.

There are several technologies for tracking goods across the supply chain, from shipping to client delivery. Data entry is a combination of manual data input and automated record-keeping facilitated by sensors and integrated internet of things (IoT) capabilities. For example [@ashrafPrototypeSupplyChain2023] describes using the Solana blockchain and Sigfox internet of things (IoT) Integration for supply chain traceability where Sigfox does not need direct access to internet but can send low powered messages across long distances (for example shipping containers on the ocean). [@vanwassenaerTokenizingCircularityAgrifood2023] compares use cases for blockchains in enhancing traceability, transparency and cleaning up the supply chain in agricultural products.

### Tracking Transport Supply Chains: Towards Sustainable Supply Chains

> "Secrecy is the linchpin of abuse of power...its enabling force. Transparency is the only real antidote." Glen Greenwald, Attorney and journalist. [@greenwaldNoPlaceHide2015]

In the most general sense, supply chain transparency enables stakeholder accountability [@circulariseFlexibleTransparencyPart2018; @dooreyTransparentSupplyChain2011; @foxUncertainRelationshipTransparency2007]. Products are made from resources distributed across the planet and transported to clients around the world which currently causes high levels (and increasing) of greenhouse gases. *"Transport greenhouse gas emissions have increased every year since 2014"* [@ClimateChangeMitigation2023]. Freight (transport of goods by trucks, trains, planes, ships) accounts for 1.14 gigatons of CO~2~ emissions as per 2015 data or 16% of total international supply chain emissions [@wangVolumeTradeinducedCrossborder2022].

| Type of Transport           | Percentage |
|-----------------------------|------------|
| Passenger cars              | 39%        |
| **Medium and heavy trucks** | 23%        |
| **Shipping**                | 11%        |
| **Aviation**                | 9%         |
| Buses and minibuses         | 7%         |
| Light commercial vehicles   | 5%         |
| Two/three-wheelers          | 3%         |
| Rail                        | 3%         |

: Share of CO~2~ of CO~2~ emissions by type of transport globally [@statistaGlobalTransportCO22022].

In shipping, [@matthewgoreEmissionsRegulationsShipping2022] reports the International Maritime Organization (IMO) targets cutting CO~2~ equivalent emissions in shipping 50% by 2050 compared to 2008. In aviation, \[@platzerPerspectiveUrgencyGreen2023}, a scientist working on the Apollo space program, calls for emergency action to develop *green aviation*.

### Tracking Ethics & Cruelty: Factories Can Become Transparent

-   Data transparency may help reduce cruelty by improving traceability. Traceability and animal rights. Animal rights vs animal welfare. Ethereum blockchain and animal rights. "Blockchain can provide a transparent, immutable record of the provenance of products. This can be especially useful for verifying claims made about animal welfare. For example, products claiming to be"free-range," "organic," or "sustainably sourced" could have their entire lifecycle recorded on the blockchain, from birth to shelf, allowing consumers to verify these claims." Cruelty free brands. BCorp. ESG. Increase your investment point by matching with your contribution /. Point of Sales integration (know the SKU you buy).

Uber is creating an all-purpose platform for travel; only 4.1% of rides were electric [@levyUberCEOSays2023]. In the UK, Uber launched and option to book flights, moving to a door-to-door travel solution where the same app brings you from home to the airport, the flight, and your final destination [@uberukUberTakesSkies2023].

Superapps are honeypots of data that is used for many types of behavior modeling. Guido Becher from Rappi defines their super-app as "customer-centric high frequency multi-vertical ecosystem" this enables cross-promotion, for example a hotel in Argentina targeted people people who buy almond milk on Rappi with their offer of a yoga retreat [@phocuswrightSuperConnectedRappi2023; @suarezEnhancingUserIncome2021] suggests using alternative data from super-apps to estimate user income levels, including 4 types of data: *Personal Information*, *Consumption Patterns*, *Payment Information*, and *Financial Services*. [@roaSuperappBehavioralPatterns2021] finds super-app alternative data is especially useful for credit-scoring young, low-wealth individuals. However, data privacy is always a concern. For instance, Kakao Pay was found guilty of mishandling 40 million users' data by handing it over to Alipay without user consent; Alipay owns a 32 percent stake in Kakao Pay [@leeKakaoPayHanded2024].

Alipay has build the digital infrastructure to provide thousands of services to billions of users. 59 million people use 支小寶(Zhixiaobao), an Al-based assistant inside of Alipay, which can order taxis and meals, but also interact with the Ant Bridge, Ant Ant Bridge, Ant Fortune and Ant Insurance services inside Alipay [@finextraAntGroupsSmart2024]. 



Superapps offer a platform with key infrastructure such as payments, where miniapps thrive @perriWhatSuperapp2022; [@heathRiseSuperApp2021].

### Aspiring Superapps

There are many companies which aspire to build superapps but are hindered by various challenges.

Telegram integrates Web3 apps into the chat and supports investing into cryptocurrencies without ever understanding the complex technology of wallets. [@pylarinouTelegramsJourneyWeb32024]. Likewise, LINE is integrating Web3 technologies based on the Kaia blockchain to provide decentralized mini-apps (dapps) for the LINE chat userbase and integrates with the LINE Pay wallet for financial interactions @hintzyLINEsEvolutionSuper2025

[@vecchiTwoTalesInternationalization2022] discusses the strategies Chinese apps are taking to expand to other markets.

-   Inspiration from WeChat. X (previously known as Twitter) is becoming a financial app. X (formerly Twitter) is becoming a superapp?

*Platform Economy* marketplace companies like Airbnb and Uber, among many others, match demand to offer, in the process optimizing how our cities work. The massive amounts of data generated by these companies are used by smart cities to re-design their physical environments, such as the collaboration between Bolt and the city of Seville in Spain [@boltSevilleModernisingPublic2025].

### Personalization: Personality Engineering and Persuasion

Kazuo Ishiguro’s book *"Klara and the Sun"*, narrated through the eyes of an AF (artifical friend) - Klara - describes the feeling of loneliness of a robot; the story offers a cautionary counterpoint, illustrating how even the most loyal and emotionally attuned AI companion could be perceived as uncanny or insufficiently human (at least, this is how it happens in the book); this example, while fictional, underscores the delicate balance required when designing AI companions for sustainability: persuasion must feel personal, but not performative [@ishiguroKlaraSun2021; @waterstonesKazuoIshiguroKlara2021; @lifelessonsfrombooksKlaraSunKazuo2023].

AI labs are putting a lot of effort into engineering likable AIs, working on honesty of the modelds, teaching them to convey their own uncertainty [@anthropicClaudesCharacter2024; @anthropicWhatShouldAIs2024]; Which sometimes can go wrong. ChatGPT-4o overnight became your biggest fan, which users found annoying; the abrupt shift to an overly enthusiastic persona drew user backlash [@mollickPersonalityPersuasion2025]. And it also felt jarring, if you already got used to a certain persona and it suddenly changed.

## Open Data Enables Interoperability

Data is the *interface* between idle resources and retail demand, which makes *exchange of value* possible. Yet often data is expensive, hard-to-get, and inaccessible. If done well, open data can enhance interoperability and enable collaboration [@WhatOpenData].

While not officially a member, Taiwan is a proponent of Open Government Partnership (OGP), and has launched its Open Government National Action Plan, promoting open data, information transparency, and expanding inclusive public participation [@opengovernmentpartnershipOGPParticipationCoCreation2021; @labTaiwanTakesActions2021]. Taiwan’s Government Open Data Platform (資料開放平臺), managed by the Ministry of Digital Affairs, centralizes hundreds of datasets; from spatial information to energy use [@ministryofdigitalaffairsPingTai2024].

Open Knowledge International's Global Open Data Index (GODI) ranked Taiwan as number 1 in its global index in 2017; the project has since been discontinued, so the ranking may be out of date in 2024 [@openknowledgefoundationGlobalOpenData2017].

```{python}
open_data_index()
```

Other indexes do not include Taiwan in the TOP 10.

```{python}

Data-driven design requires access to data, making the movement towards *open data sharing* very important. Some countries and cities are better than others at sharing data openly.

## Context Design Enables Behavioral Nudges Towards Green Defaults

For several decades, marketing researchers have been looking into how to affect human behavior towards increasing purchase decisions in commerce, both offline and online, which is why the literature on behavioral design is massive. One of the key concepts is *nudge*, first coined in 2008 by the Nobel-winning economist Richard Thaler; nudges are based on a scientific understanding of human psychology and shortcuts and triggers that human brains use and leverages that knowledge to influence humans in small but powerful ways [@thalerNudgeImprovingDecisions2009].

The principles of nudge have also been applied to sustainability. For example, a small study (n = 33) in the Future Consumer Lab in Copenhagen by [@perez-cuetoNudgingPlantbasedMeals2021] found that designing a "dish-of-the-day" which was prominently displayed helped to increase vegetarian food choice by 85%. Experiments by [@GUATH2022101821] focused on environmentally friendly online purchases in Sweden (n = 200) suggest nudging can be effective in influencing online shopping behavior towards more sustainable options. A study of behavior change in Australia at large university setting (N = 156) by [@novoradovskayaMyCupTea2021] found nudging behavioral change had a significant effect and the author suggested it may help to avoid some of the *"16 billion paper coffee cups are being thrown away every year"* globally (based on the abstract - I was unable to access the full paper).

Google uses nudges in Google Flights and Google Maps, which allow filtering flights and driving routes by the amount of CO~2~ emissions, as well as surfacing hotels with Green Key and EarthCheck credentials, while promising new sustainability features across its portfolio of products [@sundarpichaiGivingYouMore2021]. Such tools are small user interface nudges which Google's research calls *digital decarbonization*, defined by [@implementconsultinggroupHowDigitalSector2022] as *"Maximising the enabling role of digital technologies by accelerating already available digital solutions"*.

In [@katebrandtGoogleClimateAction2022], Google's Chief Sustainability Officer Kate Brandt set a target of "at least 20-25%" CO~2~ emission reductions in Europe to reach a net-zero economy and the global announcement set a target of helping 1 billion people make more sustainable choices around the world [@jenimilesBecomingSustainabilityAwareApp2022]. In addition to end--users, Google offers digital decarbonization software for developers, including the Google Cloud Carbon Footprint tool and invests in regenerative agriculture projects [@GoogleRegenerativeAgriculture2021; @googleCarbonFootprint2023].

### Sustainability Potential of New User Interfaces

Immersive communication technologies such as AR/VR hold the potential to reduce business travel, if productive meetings can be held online, reducing emissions. Likewise, visualizing large architectural projects as well as simulating product design in various industries can reduce cost by detecting problems in the 3D environment, early on in the design process, especially for collaboration in teams located all over the world [@varjoVRDEADStories2025].

AI Chatbots and Generative UIs are hugely energy-intensive and it's an open question whether the resulting productivity gains could offsett the emissions caused by these technologies.

The small screen estate space of mobiles phones and smart watches necessitates displaying content in a dynamic manner. Virtual reality glasses (called AR/VR or XR in marketing speak) need dynamic content because the user is able to move around the environment. These are questions that interaction design is called upon to solve.[@hoangEnterDynamicIsland2022]: *"Dynamic interfaces might invoke a new design language for extended reality". it's a balancing at: while* AI enables generative UIs while users need some type of stability (think: text input stays in the same place but different types of interfaces appear within a clearly defined space.

Speaking is one mode of interaction that's become increasingly possible as machines learn to interpret human language.

## Learning from Quantified Self: Tracking Health and Lifestyle

An early example of how tracking personal data enables behavior change, are health and lifestyle tracking apps. Research on *personal data tracking* also known as *quantified self* or *self-monitoring* is abundant. There's substantial academic evidence indicating that health tracking apps can have a measurable impact on user health behaviors and increase positive health outcomes. Wearable devices including the Apple Watch, Oura Ring, Fitbit and others, combined with apps, help users track a variety of health metrics. Apart from health, wearable devices have been used to track other metrics such as physiological parameters of students at school to determine their learning efficiency [@giannakosFitbitLearningCapturing2020]. Not only can health metrics be tracking, but exposure to pollution as well as personal carbon footprint, are all to some extent track-able (if not traceable).

Recently, npj Biosensing published a device from the MIT Media Lab that can track cells inside the human body from a wrist-worn device [@jarvisWearableDeviceTracks2025; @jangWearableDeviceContinuous2025]

### Health and Fitness Tracking

Tracking one's health and fitness is a familiar mode of *quantified self*, available to many smartwatch users - and even pretty much to anyone who has a phone made in the past decade. Apple is a leader in health tracking, releasing Apple Health in 2008 as an iOS 8 software feature and the Apple Watch in 2015, filled with health-focused sensors and features [@appleHowAppleEmpowering2022]. In 2022 Apple outlined plans for *"empowering people to live a healthier day,"* promising a new set of health-features with every release, such as the rumored temperature measurement inside of Apple Aipord earphones; and providing most of this data to developers through Apple's HealthKit health metrics APIs, which app builders can tap into [@appleEmpoweringPeopleLive2022; @appleWhatNewHealthKit2022].

Sleep quality is an important aspect of health and many devices and apps focus on helping people get enough high quality sleep. There's plenty of academic literature on how physical activity, as well as environmental aspects, such as air quality, affect sleep [@liuHowPhysicalExercise2019] tracks how wearable data is used for tracking sleep improvements from exercise. [@grigsby-toussaintSleepAppsBehavioral2017] made use of sleep apps to construct humans behaviors also known as *behavioral constructs*.

The Oura ring is an example of *calm technology*, providing helpful data without calling an attention to itself [@phelanOuraRingCEO2024]. More recently, Oura Ring launched an AI-advisor to help explain the health data recorded by its device: deliver contextual and personalized guidance, remember past interactions while emphasizing privacy, and analyze both short- and long-term biometric trends [@teamIntroducingOuraAdvisor2025]. There's value in developing standardized fitness metrics, which different digital health providers can use to create dashboards with comparable data. Even with messy data, AI has a useful role as a translator between different standards.

Could one track personal sustainability in a similar fashion? [@shinWearableActivityTrackers2019]'s synthesis review of 463 studies shows wearable devices have potential to influence behavior change towards healthier lifestyles. While the behavior changes may sound simple - like switching from driving to walking - and would have and effect both on health and the environmental, they are hindered by factors from personal motivation to (lack of) suitable urban architecture. [@delclos-alioWalkingTransportationLarge2022] discusses walking in Latin-American cities. Walking is the most sustainable method or transport but requires the availability of city infrastructure, such as sidewalks, which many cities still lack.

[@saubadePromotingPhysicalActivity2016] finds health tracking is useful for motivating physical activity. The urban environment has an influence on health. [@sanchezGreenBearLoRaWANbased2022] suggests tracking users using their smartphones and attributing points for actions deemed beneficial - yet this has potential privacy issues. For any service tracking the user's action, following privacy UX guidelines is crucial [@jarovskyYouAreProbably2022].

@GreenFintechTrends2020 report predicts the rise of personalizing sustainable finance, because of its potential to grow customer loyalty, through improving the user experience. Similarly to good design, interacting with sustainable finance for the 'green-minded' demographics, providing a reliable green product is a way to build customer loyalty. The UN has been handing out Global Climate Action Awards since 2011 for idea such as the Climate Credit Card in Switzerland, which automatically tracks emissions of purchases, creates emissions' reports for the user which can then be offset with investments in climate projects around the world [@unfcccClimateCreditCard2023].

### Carbon Tracking: Personal Emissions Trackers

We have a limited carbon budget so calculating CO2e-cost become integrated into every activity. Already in 2017, a project funded by the EU Horizon 2020 title *"Instant Gratification for Collective Awareness and Sustainable Consumerism"* piloted the concept of *"political consumerism"*, by enabling shoppers at 2 stores (Estonia and Austria) to experience real-time, personalized sustainability ratings on nearby products (by using a mobile app and bluetooth beacons to locate shoppers at shelf level, while maintaining privacy); instead of isolated choices, individual preferences were (environmental, health, political) aggregated into a community "sustainability signal"; the results indicated a statistically significant increase in sustainability awareness and some users praised the simplicity of the user interface [@klinglmayrSustainableConsumerismContextAware2017; @bennatiPrivacyenhancingAggregationInternet2018; @pournarasSelfregulatoryInformationSharing2016; @InstantGratificationCollective2022].

The founder of the Commons (formerly known as Joro) consumer CO~2e~ tracking app recounts how people have a gut feeling about the 2000 calories one needs to eat daily, so perhaps daily CO~2e~ tracking could develop a gut feeling about one's carbon footprint [@jasonjacobsEpisodeSanchaliPal2019]. Zhang's Personal Carbon Economy conceptualized the idea of carbon as a currency used for buying and selling goods and services, as well as an individual carbon exchange to trade one's carbon permits [@zhangPersonalCarbonEconomy2018]. These type of app suggest CO2e calculations will be part of our everyday experience. Nonetheless, sustaining user engagement over time in sustainability tracking apps is challenging, because the perceived personal benefit and measurable impact is so minimal - it may feel meaningless.​ Tracking sustainability may have collective benefits but tracking health has immediate personal benefits. Health apps feel tangible with increased well-being while sustainability apps often feel more collective, long-term and sometimes with benefits too small to matter, making it harder to motivate individual users. 

Sustainability tracking, while perhaps less than health tracking, can also have a measurable impact. One study of personal carbon footprint tracking apps (aka CO2 calculators) in a mid-sized German city (n = 216) helped overall emission reduction by 23% correlating with feedback from the app specifically reducing emissions from heating 26.9%, food 16.4%, household 34.7% reduction, and mobility 12% [@hoffmannCarbonFootprintTracking2024]. Better maps can also convince people to make changes; advanced maps which visualize erosion, heat, flooding, fire, drought, extreme weather, and other climate risks, can inform resilience planning; a map for transport, such as taxis, can visualize pickup/dropoff imbalances, coloring areas green where pickups exceed dropoffs and orange where dropoffs exceed pickups, can help users see spatial patterns and inform climate-resilient transport planning [@cartoClimateResilienceGeography2023].

Because of the large emission fooprint of transport, offering a steep emissions reduction potential, greener modes of mobility have been heavily researched. Already more than a decade ago, a survey from April 2014 to December 2015 (n = 4586, total 29930 travel episodes) across the United Kingdom, asked participants to rate their enjoyment (on a liker scale from 1 to 7) and tracked the type of travel (work, unpaid work, personal care, childcare, leisure, etc); resuls showed private car was used for 79% of personal care and 55% of leisure trips; key findings showed *walking and cycling significantly increase enjoyment* across all trip purposes, while public transit reduced enjoyment for childcare and work-related travel; overall findings show improvements in transport infrastructure can both lower green house gas emissions and boost traveler wellbeing [@echeverriaGreenMobilityWellbeing2022].

A wide range of personal carbon footprint calculators have been released online, ranging from those made by governments and companies to student projects. Similar to personal health trackers, personal CO~2~ trackers help one track emissions and suggests sustainable actions.

In Singapore, the DBS bank released a consumer sustainability ESG app called DBS LiveBetter [@dbssingaporeDBSLiveBetter; @dbsDBSLaunchesSingapore2018]

[@TAN202046] proposes *"financial ecologies"* to understand the dynamic relationships between various actors: investors, advisors, government, where the government plays an active role in growing financial inclusion and responsible financial management; however, the paper further suggests that current robo-advisors (available in Singapore) make the investor captive to the agency of AI, making the person lose agency over their financial decisions.

## Digital Product Passports: Towards Tracking Sustainability Superapps

Even though *digital product passports* relate heavily to adopting a circular economy, I've chosen to highlight this topic under Design, as it's the main design implication from this chapter - an emerging technology which needs to be *designed*.

[@nissinenMakeCarbonFootprints2022] calls for emissions data to be made available to manufacturers, retailers, and consumers so they can make low-carbon choices; moreover, metrics must move beyond a single aggregated number to assessing life-cycle emissions' variability. One way to achieve this is called Digital Product Passports (DPP), a further development of the idea of carbon labels, capturing a comprehensive trace of data needed for green transformation.

[@reichDefiningGoalsProduct2023] identifies *information gaps* as one of the major obstacles to realizing a circular economy; a study of 28 experts across academia, industry, government, consultancy and NGOs, showed Digital Product Passports (DPPs) can enhance the 9 "R" in circular strategies. The first full articulation of the 9 R strategies came from the report *"Circular Economy – Measuring Innovation in the Product Chain"*, where [@potting2017circular] laid out a hierarchy of circular‐economy options; the framework was later adopted and popularized in peer-reviewed literature, for example [@kirchherrConceptualizingCircularEconomy2017].

| R-Strategy | Definition |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| R9 Recover | Incineration of material (energy recovery) |
| R8 Recycle | Process materials, obtaining the same (high grade) or lower grade quality |
| R7 Repurpose | Use discarded product (or its parts) in a new product (with a different function) |
| R6 Remanufacture | Use parts of a discarded product in a new product (with the same function) |
| R5 Refurbish | Restore an old product (bring it up to date) |
| R4 Repair | Maintenance of a product so it can be used with its original function |
| R3 Reuse | Reuse by another consumer (still in good condition and fulfills its original function) |
| R2 Reduce | Increase efficiency in product manufacture (consume fewer natural resources and materials) |
| R1 Rethink | Use the product more intensively (sharing the product via online platforms, etc) |
| R0 Refuse | Don't use product at all (or replace the function with a better alternative) |

: The 9 R strategies from [@potting2017circular].

[@kingProposedUniversalDefinition2023] propose a universal definition of a Digital Product Passport Ecosystem (DPPE) as a “system-of-systems,” synthesizing stakeholder requirements and concerns from the EU’s open consultation on the Sustainable Products Initiative, aimingto influence consumer behavior towards sustainable purchasing - and responsible product ownership - by making the sustainability aspects of a product life cycle clearly apparent.

There's extensive literature on the use Digital Product Passports (DPP) at specific industries and for particular use cases, often focused on improved efficiencies. [@plociennikDigitalLifecyclePassport2022] details the use of Digital Product Passports and the cloud platform infrastructure to improve e-waste sorting when paired with ML-based object detection.
[@bergerConfidentialitypreservingDataExchange2023] outlines data-science and machine-learning approaches (for example sharing models) to enable the exchange of sensitive EV-battery life-cycle data through Digital Product Passports, while preserving confidentiality, helping overcome stakeholder reluctance. [@jensenDigitalProductPassports2023] study of mechatronics supply chains found DPPs *"support decision-making throughout product life cycles in favor of a circular economy"*; specifically: 

> (1) usage and maintenance 
> (2) identification
> (3) materials
> (4) guidelines
> (5) supply-chain and reverse logistics
> (6) environmental data
> (7) compliance

With the increasing electrification of transport, finding ways to deal with the batteries is a crucial area of research. [@bergerDataRequirementsAvailabilities2023] examined the stakeholers of electric vehicle (EV) battery value-chain and mapped their data requirements and current availabilities, laying groundwork to propose a *Digital Battery Passport*.[@bergerFactorsDigitalProduct2023] lists current challenges with EV batteries, providing empirical insights into difficulties with DPP adoption, including technical, organizational, and policy barriers; an interesting part of the research is the introduction go *"Sustainable Product Management"* (SPM) as a specific field of management in the context of circular economy.

They key barriers to adoption from [@bergerFactorsDigitalProduct2023] include:

> Uncertainty of stakeholders
> Technological barriers
> Insufficient willingness to share information
> Lack of clear legal requirements and standards

Meanwhile the enablers include:

> Clear legal requirements
> Relative advantages (reputation gains, access to new markets access, risk avoidance, marketing)
> Monetary incentives (such as payments for data)
> Intrinsic motivation (compatibility with the values)

Focusing on food production industries, a brief historical overview of previous efforts in this area may be helpful, to contextualize the discussion. CO~2e~ labeling initiatives represent an early attempt to communicate the environmental cost of each product. Using carbon labels to convey CO~2e~ emission of consumer products has been a topic of discussion for decades [@adamcornerWhyWeNeed2012]. Academic literature has looked at minute details such as color and positioning of the label [@zhouCarbonLabelsHorizontal2019]. There's some indication consumers are willing to pay a small premium for low-CO~2e~ products; all else being equal, consumers choose the option with a lower CO~2e~ number [@xuLowcarbonEconomyCarbon2022; @carlssonSustainableFoodCan2022]. [@cohenPotentialRoleCarbon2012] argues labeling the carbon footprint of products does help inform consumer choice towards sustainability and help promote a green economy. A large-scale study of UK university students finds some evidence to suggest labeling low CO~2e~ food enables people to choose a *climatarian diet*, however the impact of carbon labels on the market share of low-carbon meals is negligible [@lohmannCarbonFootprintLabels2022].

Similar to to *Nutritional Facts Labeling*, *Carbon Labels* provide basic information regarding the emissions' profile of each product,yet taken alone, without a systemic push for carbon reduction, they are insufficient to drive significant behavioral change. A study in Sweden underlines a negative correlation between worrying about climate impact and interest in climate information on products [@edenbrandtConsumerPerceptionsAttitudes2022]. This latter finding may be interpreted to suggest a need for wider environmental education programs among consumers. [@asioliConsumersValuationCultured2022] found differences between countries, where Spanish and British consumers chose meat products with *'no antibiotics ever'* over a *Carbon Trust* label, whereas French consumers chose CO~2~ labeled meat products. Despite ongoing interest, several studies have shown that the overall impact of carbon labeling on consumer behavior remains negligible. The idea is yet to find mainstream adoption and participation in carbon labeling schemes remains voluntary, with only a limited number of companies implementing such practices, although their numbers are gradually increasing. Notable examples include the U.S.-based restaurant chain *Just Salad* , U.K.-based vegan meat-alternative *Quorn*, and plant milk *Oatly*, all of which provide carbon labeling on their products [@briankatemanCarbonLabelsAre2020]. [@climatepartnerLabellingCarbonFootprint2020] Companies like ClimatePartner and Carbon Calories offers labeling consumer goods with emission data as a service. [@thecarbontrustHowReduceYour] The Carbon Trust reports it's certified 270000 product emissions' footprints.

Transitioning from simpler carbon labels to data-driven *Digital Product Passports* requires comprehensive data collection on product's history, composition, and environmental impact, digital infrastructure, industry collaboration, regulatory frameworks, and consumer engagement.

| Goal | Description |
|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Sustainable Product Production** |  |
| **Businesses to create value through Circular Business Models** |  |
| **Consumers to make more informed purchasing decisions** |  |
| **Verify compliance with legal obligations** |  |

: Digital Product Passport goals [@strettonDigitalProductPassports2022].

[@vancapelleveenAnatomyPassportCircular2023] conducted a comprehensive, structured review of 200 academic papers on Digital Product Passports and related concepts, including circular, product, material, resource, recycling, and cradle-to-cradle variants, assessing dimensions such as historical developments, stakeholders, goals, challenges, and designs for solutions, in order to formalize the concept and its boundaries, finally synthesizing a unified definition:

> *“a digital interface composing a certified identity of a single identifiable product by accessing the set of life cycle registrations linked to this object in order to yield insight into the sustainability and circularity characteristics, the circular value estimation, and the circular opportunities for both that product and its underlying components and materials.”*

Circularise, a leader in providing digital product passports as a service, lists 15 types of data that should be include in a DPP [@tiandaphneWhatDataGoes2023]. A case study of rigid polyurethane foam (PU foam), a lightweight insulation material, explains how Circularise used blockchain and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) to allow for DPP data-sharing, while retaining privacy and control over the data [@leonTerritorialCircularEcosystems2025; @daphneZeroknowledgeProofsExplained2022].

### Towards Sustainable Product Management 

[@gnanasambandamSustainabilityPrivacyDiversity2022] describes responsible product management as embedding privacy, sustainability, and inclusion into product design as core priorities, not afterthoughts. [@korzhovaSustainableProductManagement2020] works as a Sustainable Product Manager at Grover, an online platform which offers product for rent; she details how rentals-based business model has saved 360 tons of devices from going to waste (the author compares the amount to about 15 truckloads of devices), which sums up to 4275 tons of CO₂ savings.
