## Eco-Design

...for Sustainable Products

How can design enable/help/encourage sustainability?

Transformatiion towards Eco-design has strong political support from the European Union. @europeanparliamentEcodesignSustainableProducts2022 proposal "On 30 March 2022, the European Commission put forward a proposal for a regulation establishing a general framework for setting eco-design requirements for sustainable products, repealing rules currently in force which concentrate on energy-related products only." Virginijus Sinkevičius, EU Commissioner for the Environment, Oceans and Fisheries, is quoted as describing eco-design "respects the boundaries of our planet" @europeancommissionGreenDealNew2022

In *digital sustainability*, information pertaining to emissions would flow through the economy not unlike the carbon cycle itself.

Designing for Sustainability has many names, with subtle differences of emphasis, Circular Design, Eco-Design, Cradle-to-Cradle Design, Green Design, Regenerative Design, Climate-Responsive Design, Life-Centered Design, and possibly others. In any case, designing for sustainability makes use of *systems thinking*, looking at the entire lifecycle of a product or service. Sustainable design encompasses all human activities, making this pursuit an over-arching challenge across all industries also known as circular economy. Assuming that as individuals we want to act in a sustainable way, how exactly would be go about doing that?

*Life-Centered Design* recognizes human impact on our surrounding environment as well as other animals making sure to include them among stakeholders While *Human-Centered Design* has become popular, the effect humans are having on biodiversity should be considered when designing. *"\[T\]he design phase of a physical product accounts for 80% of its environmental impact"* notes[@borthwickHumancentredLifecentredDesign2022] in their framework for life-centered design.

Because sustainability is so complex, sustainable design makes use of scenarios. *Life Cycle Assessment* and *Environmental Impact Analysis* are needed to provide eco-design scenarios [@DELAPUENTEDIAZDEOTAZU2022718].

-   "Evolution of design for sustainability: From product design to design for system innovations and transitions"

-   High quality durable products are more sustainable as they last longer and less likely to be thrown away. Forming an emotional bond with the product makes it feel more valuable [@zonneveldEmotionalConnectionsObjects2014]. This has implications for sustainability as the object is less likely to be thrown away.

Climate-Reponsive Design embeds a building within the environmental constraints of a place and looks for opportunities use the land, wind, sun, local materials, and local vernacular history and culture when considering a design. Architect Susanne Brorson suggests sustainability should be considered in the earlier phases of design instead of trying to fix problems later discussing *climate-responsive design principles* [@evmmaaarhitektuurikeskusClimateresponsiveDesignPrinciples2019].

-   @sanchezGreenBearLoRaWANbased2022 LoRaWAN

Regenerative design suggests de-materializing (digitizing) economies is not enough and design should look for avenues to regenerate damaged or destroyed natural systems – ecosystems, biodiversity, land, forests, lakes, rivers - natural habitats.

### Data-Driven Design Enables Sustainability

Sustainability touches every facet of human existence and is thus an enormous undertaking. Making progress on sustainability is only possible if there's a large-scale coordinated effort by humans around the planet. For this to happen, appropriate technological tools are required.

-   Use imagination

-   Societal movements change things: implication for design: build a community

-   Processes sustain things: implication for design: built an app

### AI-Assisted Design Enables Desiging for Sustainability

@guptaAnalysisArtificialIntelligencebased2023 argues software is key to building more sustainable products, already for decades. More recently, companies like AutoDesk are putting CO~2~ calculations inside their design software.

-   AI has the potential to provide the parameters for sustainability. @singhArtificialNeuralNetwork2023 proposes an AI tool for deciding the suitable life cycle design parameters.
-   @SustainabilityStartsDesign: "Sustainability starts in the design process, and AI can help".

### Designing Interfaces for Sustainable Interactions

Humans live in artificial environments where *most* *things* are designed by humans. The *experiences* we take part in are increasingly created based on some type of data.

Design encompasses most everything in our daily lives.

***Data is the interface*** between idle resources and retail demand, which makes *exchange of value* possible.

Interaction Design for Climate Change: how can we change common UIs so they take into account sustainability?

Popular blogs such as [@kohliHowDesignersCan2019] and [@loseWaysUXDesign2023] offer many suggestions how designers can help people become more sustainable in their daily lives yet focusing on the end-user neglects the producers' responsibility (termed as Extended Producer Responsibility or ERP) in waste management studies.

## Data-Driven Design

### Platform Economy Companies Popularise Data-Driven Design

**Capturing User Data**

As we humans go about our daily business, governments and companies track our activities using various technologies, which produces massive amounts of user interaction data.

Making *anything* consumes natural resources, which are limited on planet Earth.

There are many approaches to design - from playful to practical to critical and to data-driven. Nonetheless, many types of design share a common goal designing for a good *user experience*. Simplifying.

Platform economy companies capture large amounts of data from users.

Data is useful for designing better products.

Designing for high retention (users keep coming back).

*Network Effects,* the more people use a platform, the more valuable it becomes.

*Platform economy* marketplace companies like Airbnb, Uber among many others match optimize how our cities work.

Platforms that continuously add features (provided consumer legislation allows it) may eventually evolve into superapps, which are useful for providing services for a wide category of human needs.

Superapps are possible thanks to **Nudge, Economies of Scale, Network Effects, Behaviour Design.**

Personalization at scale: the largest businesses today (measured in number of users) design the whole user experience. Popular consumer platforms strive to design solutions that feel personalized at every touchpoint on the user journey (to use the language of service design) at the scale of hundreds of billions of users.

Superapps are honeypots of data that is used for many types of behavior modeling. [@suarezEnhancingUserIncome2021] suggests using alternative data from super-apps to estimate user income levels, including 4 types of data: Personal Information, Consumption Patterns, Payment Information, and Financial services. [@roaSuperappBehavioralPatterns2021] finds super-app alternative data is especially useful for credit-scoring young, low-wealth individuals. The massive amounts of data generated by these companies are used by smart cities to re-design their physical environments.

| Enablers of Platform Economics | Pros | Cons |
|--------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Network effects | The more people use a platform, the more valuable it becomes. | Data is not portable. You can't leave because you'll lose the audience. |
| Scalability |  |  |
| Data-driven Design |  |  |
| Behaviour Design |  |  |

### Data-Driven Design Enables Generative User Interfaces

There are many partially overlapping design terms created by different people for diverse purposes. Design vocabulary may be created for distinguishing a particular type of design from another - or to market oneself as the creator of the word.

There are many ways to structure design theory. For the purposes of this AI-focused research, I will begin from Generative UI.

structure: data-driven design, generative UI

AI is able to predict what kind of UI would the user need right now, based on the data and context.

-   Replit, a startup known for allowing user build apps in the web browser, released Openv0, a framework of AI-generated UI components [@replitReplitOpenv0OpenSource2023]. "Components are the foundation upon which user interfaces (UI) are built, and generative AI is unlocking component creation for front-end developers, transforming a once arduous process, and aiding them in swiftly transitioning from idea to working components."
-   Vercel introduced an open-source prototype UI-generator called V0 which used large language models (LLMs) to create code for web pages based on text prompts [@vercelIntroducingV0Generative2023]. Other similar tools quickly following including Galileo AI, Uizard AutoDesigner and Visily [@WhoBenefitsMost2024].
-   In 2014, the eminent journal *Information Sciences* decided to dedicate a special section to AI-generated software to call attention to this tectonic shift in software development [@reformatSpecialSectionApplications2014].
-   As machines become more capable, machines will eventually be capable of producing machines.
-   Generative UIs are largely invented in practice, based on user data analysis and experimentation, rather than being built in theory. Kelly Dern, a Senior Product Designer at Google lead a workshop in early 2024 on *GenUI for product inclusion* aiming to create ***"**more accessible and inclusive \[UIs for\] users of all backgrounds**".***
-   [@GenerativeUIDesign2023] gives an overview of the history of generative AI design tools going back in time until 2012 when [@troianoGeneticAlgorithmsSupporting2014] proposed genetic algorithms for UI design.
-   [@fletcherGenerativeUIDownfall2023] and [@joeblairGenerativeUINew2024] are worried UIs are becoming average; that is more and more similar towards the lowest common denominator. We can generate better ones that are based on user data and would be truly personalized.
-   [@nielsenAccessibilityHasFailed2024] recounts how 30 years of work towards usability has largely failed - computers are still not accessible enough (***"difficult, slow, and unpleasant"***) - and has hope Generative UI could offer a chance to provide levels of accessibility humans could not.
-   [@matteosciortinoGenerativeUIHow2024] coins the phrase RTAG UIs *"real-time automatically-generated UI interfaces"* mainly drawing from the example of how his Netflix interface looks different from that of his sisters because of their dissimilar usage patterns.
-   [@NielsenIdeasGenerative2024] Meanwhile is very critical because for the following reasons:

| Problem            | Description                                       |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Low predictability | Does personalization mean the UI keeps changing?  |
| High carbon cost   | AI-based personalization is computation-intensive |
| Surveillance       | Personalization needs large-scale data capture    |

: Criticism of Generative UI by [@NielsenIdeasGenerative2024].

What is the user interface of the green transformation?

-   @katemoranGenerativeUIOutcomeOriented2024 "highly personalized, tailor-made interfaces that suit the needs of each individual" "Outcome-Oriented Design"

@mckeoughMcKinseyDesignLaunches2018 business consultancies have begun to recognize the importance of design to business. They advise their corporate clients to bring user experience design to the core of their business operations.

There's a number of user interface design patterns that have provide successful across a range of social media apps. Such ***user experience / user interface*** (UX/UI) patterns are copied from one app to another, to the extent that the largest apps share a similar look and feature set. Common UX/UI parts include the Feed and Stories. By using common UI parts from social media users have an easier time to accept the innovative parts. add Viz charts. Avatars are increasingly common and new generations are used to talking to computers.

| Feature   | Examples                           |     |
|-----------|------------------------------------|-----|
| Feed      |                                    |     |
| Post      | Apple App Store                    |     |
| Stories   | IG, FB, WhatsApp, SnapChat, TikTok |     |
| Comment   |                                    |     |
| Reactions |                                    |     |

: Common Social Media UI Parts

There are also more philosophical approaches to ***Interface Studies:*** @davidhoangCreatingInterfaceStudies2022, the head of product design at Webflow, suggests taking cues from art studies to ***isolate the core problem***: *"An art study is any action done with the intention of learning about the subject you want to draw"*. As a former art student, Hoang looks at an interface as *"a piece of design is an artwork with function"*.

Indeed, art can be a way to see new paths forward, practicing "*fictioning*" to deal with problematic legacies: @Review2023Helsinki2023

### **Interaction Design**

-   Involving young HCI designers in AI-oriented workshops can show the future of UI/UX ? [@battistoniCanAIOrientedRequirements2023]

### Speculative Design

Speculative design makes use of future scenarios to envision contexts and interactions in future use. The term ***speculative design*** was invented by @dunneSpeculativeEverythingDesign2013 in their seminal book to question the intersection of user experience design and speculative fiction. For example @BARENDREGT2021374 explores the potential of speculative design to stimulate public engagement through thought experiments that spur public debate on an issue chosen by the designer.

Phil Balagtas, founder of The Design Futures Initiative at McKinsey, discusses the value of building future scenarios at his talk at Google. One of his examples, the Apple Knowledge Navigator, from an Apple vision video in 1987, took two decades to materialize in the real world. It was inspired by a similar device first shown in a 1970s episode of Star Trek as a **magic device** (a term from participatory design), which then inspired subsequent consumer product development. It took another 2 decades, until the launch of the iPhone in 2007 - a total of 40 years. Imagination is crucial for change [@googledesignDesignSpeculativeFutures2019].

The cost of speculative design makes it into a niche activity yet Generative AI holds the promise to allow designers to dream up and prototype quicker. In order to build a future, it's relevant to imagine and critique a future.

The same is true for Participatory Design. By being quickly generate prototypes, once can test out ideas with the future users involving more of the community and stakeholders.

### Quantified Self

Example of quantified self device. My personal air pollution exposure tracked using the Atmotube device attached to my backpack.

-   Open Source code for calculating air pollution exposure AQI [@atmotechAtmotubeAqipy2024].

-   Quantified Self is an example of Digital Health

-   Tracking air pollution and realizing how bad the over in my grandma's house is: add picture

-   There is a parallel in health to sustainability and indeed both are inextricably linked.

-   Use technology Wearables to be more aware of one's health.

-   EEG (electroencephalogram), ECG (Electrocardiogram), EDA (Electrodermal Activity): tracking features of brain, heart and nervous system activity. Brain Music Lab founder and brain researcher Grace Leslie: "brain music sounds like a warm bathtub".

-   Companies like NeuralLink are building devices to build meaningful interactions from brain waves (EEG).

Research on ***quantified self*** is abundant. Wearable devices including the Apple Watch, Oura Ring, Fitbit and others, combined with apps, help users track a variety of health metrics. Apart from health, wearable devices have been used to track other metrics such as physiological parameters of students at school to determine their learning efficiency [@giannakosFitbitLearningCapturing2020].

Could one track personal sustainability in a similar fashion? [@shinWearableActivityTrackers2019]'s synthesis review of 463 studies shows wearable devices have potential to influence behavior change towards healthier lifestyles. @saubadePromotingPhysicalActivity2016 finds health tracking is useful for motivating physical activity.

Apple is a leader in health tracking. In 2022 Apple outlined plans for ***"empowering people to live a healthier day"*** and Apple's HealthKit provides a growing list of health metrics, which app developers can tap into [@appleEmpoweringPeopleLive2022; @appleWhatNewHealthKit2022]. @liuHowPhysicalExercise2019 tracks how wearable data is used for tracking sleep improvements from exercise. @grigsby-toussaintSleepAppsBehavioral2017 made use of sleep apps to construct humans behaviors also known as ***behavioral constructs***.

-   Tracking blood sugar with app and patches. Blood sugar trackers. Blood glucose tracking is popular even for people without diabetes, to optimize their activity [@BloodSugarMonitoring2021]..

Another aspect is tracking one's mental health. [@tylerContemporarySelfreflectivePractices2022] surveys the use of self-reflection apps in the UK (n=998).

-   Popular Strava (100+ million users) sports assistant provides run tracking and feedback [@stravaStravaGlobalCommunity2022].

**Digital Product Design is increasingly data-driven**

Design is as much about how it works as it's about the interface.

Digital product design can be seen as a specific discipline under the umbrella of **Experience Design**. In @michaelabrashInventingFuture2017 Meta Oculus augmented reality incubation general manager Laura Fryer: *"People buy experiences, not technology."*

Young people expect a product. Intelligent Interfaces use interaction design to provide relevant and personalized information in the right context and at the right time.

@ceschinEvolutionDesignSustainability2016 shows how design for sustainability has expanded from a product focus to systems-thinking focus placing the product inside a societal context of use. For example @CargoBikeFREITAG, recycled clothing maker FREITAG offers sustainability-focused services such ass cargo bikes so you can transport your purchases and a network for *shopping without payment* = swapping your items with other members, as well as repairs of their products. Loaning terminology from ***service design***, the user journey within an app needs to consider each touchpoint on the way to a state of success.

@weinschenk100ThingsEvery2011 says *"People expect most online interactions to follow the same social rules as person-to-person interactions. It's a shortcut that your brain uses to quickly evaluate trustworthiness."*

The small screen estate space of mobiles phones and smart watches necessitates displaying content in a dynamic manner. Virtual reality glasses (called AR/VR or XR in marketing speak) need dynamic content because the user is able to move around the environment. These are questions that interaction design is called upon to solve. @hoangEnterDynamicIsland2022: *"Dynamic interfaces might invoke a new design language for extended reality".*

The promise of ***Generative UI*** is to dynamically provide an interface appropriate for the particular user and context.

Speaking is one mode of interaction that's become increasingly possible as machines learn to interpret human language.

| Mode of Interaction |     |

### Behavioral Design

For decades, marketers and researchers have been researching how to affect human behavior towards increasing purchase decisions in commerce, both offline and online, which is why the literature on behavioral design is massive. One of the key concepts is *nudge*, first coined in 2008 by the Nobel-winning economist Richard Thaler; nudges are based on a scientific understanding of human psychology and shortcuts and triggers that human brains use and leverages that knowledge to influence humans in small but powerful ways [@thalerNudgeImprovingDecisions2009].

The principles of nudge have also been applied to sustainability. For example, a small study (n=33) in the Future Consumer Lab in Copenhagen by @perez-cuetoNudgingPlantbasedMeals2021 found that designing a "dish-of-the-day" which was prominently displayed helped to increase vegetarian food choice by 85%. @GUATH2022101821 experiments (n=200) suggested nudging can be effective in influencing online shopping behavior towards more sustainable options. A larger scale study of behavior change in Australia maps how to avoid "16 billion paper coffee cups are being thrown away every year" [@novoradovskayaMyCupTea2021].

Google uses nudges in Google Flights and Google maps, which allow filtering flights and driving routes by the amount of CO~2~ emissions, as well as surfacing hotels with Green Key and EarthCheck credentials, while promising new sustainability features across its portfolio of products @sundarpichaiGivingYouMore2021. Such tools are small user interface nudges which Google's research calls *digital decarbonization*, defined by @implementconsultinggroupHowDigitalSector2022 as "Maximising the enabling role of digital technologies by accelerating already available digital solutions".

In @katebrandtGoogleClimateAction2022, Google's Chief Sustainability Officer Kate Brandt set a target of "at least 20-25%" CO~2~ emission reductions in Europe to reach a net-zero economy and the global announcement set a target of helping 1 billion people make more sustainable choices around the world [@jenimilesBecomingSustainabilityAwareApp2022]. In addition to end--users, Google offers digital decarbonization software for developers, including the Google Cloud Carbon Footprint tool and invests in regenerative agriculture projects [@GoogleRegenerativeAgriculture2021; @googleCarbonFootprint2023].

| Prompting | Create cues and reminders to perform a certain behavior |
| Sizing | Decrease or increase the size of items or portions |
| Proximity | Change the physical (or temporal) distance of options |
| Presentation | Change the way items are displayed |
| Priming | Expose users to certain stimuli before decision-making |
| Labelling | Provide labels to influence choice (for example CO~2~ footprint labels) |

### Generative UIs

...

## Re-Designing Industries

...for Provenance and Traceability

It's possible to re-design entire industries and that is exactly the expectation sustainability sets on businesses. Across all industries, there's a call for more transparency. Conversations about sustainability are too general and one needs to look at the specific sustainability metrics at specific industries to be able to design for meaningful interaction. There's plentiful domain-specific research showing how varied industries can develop eco-designed products. I will here focus on 2 industries that are relevant for college students.

### Fashion

Young people are the largest consumers of fast fashion [@YoungConsumersComplicated]. [In @europeanenvironmentagencyTextilesEnvironmentRole2022 European Environment Agency (EEA)] estimates based on trade and production data that EU27 citizens consumed an average 15kg of textile products per person per year.

-   Potato used to be a newcomer and innovative crop in Europe, and not it's so common, we forget it's no originally from here.

-   @aubreystreitkrugPathwaysPerennialFood2023 food is also about cuisine and culture; foods become popular if we hear stories and see cuisine around a particular crop.

-   "The agricultural sector contributes to approximately 13.5% of the total global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and accounts for 25% of the total CO~2~ emission" @nabipourafrouziComprehensiveReviewCarbon2023. @pooreReducingFoodEnvironmental2018 suggests 26% of carbon emissions come from food production. @FoodPrints2015 reports dairy (46%) and meat and fish (29%) products making up the largest GHG emission potential. @springmannGlobalRegionalCosts2021 proposes veganism is the most effective decision to reduce personal CO~2~ emissions.

Complex supply chains make seafood (marine Bivalvia, mollusks) logistics prone to fraud, leading to financial losses and threats to consumer health [@santosCurrentTrendsTraceability2023]. The same is true for cocoa beans, which are at risk from food fraud [@fanningLinkingCocoaQuality2023].

-   Food Sovereignty: "The global food sovereignty movement, which had been building momentum since its grassroots conception in the late '90s, quickly gained traction with its focus on the rights of people everywhere to access healthy and sustainable food. One of the pillars of the movement lies in using local food systems to reduce the distance between producers and consumers."

-   @caitlinstall-paquetFreshCityRise2021: "We can grow foods just as well in the inner city as we can out in the country because we're agnostic to arable land," says Woods. "Because we grow indoors and create our own weather, \[climate change\] doesn't affect our produce."

### Construction

-   According to @debnathSocialMediaEnables2022 39% of global CO~2~ emissions comes from the building sector.
-   Construction is large emitter because of the use of concrete; super tall buildings are very CO~2~ intensive [@zhaoEmbodiedCarbonBased2015].

-   @oikosdenktankWebinarDoughnutEconomics2021 circular material procurement requires new skills. How to reuse old paint? Small projects can have large social impact.
-   For example, @DURIEZ2022454 shows how simply by reducing material weight it's possible to design more sustainable transportation.

### Circular Economy

Circular design is only possible if supply chains become circular as well.

It's important in which structure data is stored, affecting the ability to efficiently access and manage the data while guaranteering a high level of data integrity, security, as well as energy usage of said data.

The complexity of resource and delivery networks necessitates more advanced tools to map supply chains [@knightFutureBusinessRole2022]. The COVID19 pandemic and resulting blockages in resource delivery highlighted the need to have real-time visibility into supply chains [@finkenstadtBlurryVisionSupply2021].

Blockchains are a special type of database where the data is stored in several locations with a focus on making the data secure and very difficult to modify after it's been written to the database. Once data is written to the blockchain, modifying it would require changing all subsquent records in the chain and agreement of the majority of validators who host a version of the database.

Blockchain is the main technology considered for accounting for the various inputs and complex web of interactions between many participants inside the supply chain networks. There are hundreds of paper researching blockchain use in supply change operations since 2017 [@duttaBlockchainTechnologySupply2020]. Blockchains enable saving immutable records into distributed databases (also known as ledgers). It's not possible to (or extremely difficult) to change the same record, only new records can be added on top of new ones. Blockchains are useful for data sharing and auditing, as the time and place of data input can be guaranteed, and it will be easier to conduct a search on who inputted incorrect data; however the system still relies on correct data input. As the saying goes, *"garbage in, garbage out"*.

There are several technologies for tracking goods across the supply chain, from shipping to client delivery. Data entry is a combination of manual data input and automated record-keeping facilitated by sensors and integrated internet of things (IoT) capabilities. For example [@ashrafPrototypeSupplyChain2023] describes using the Solana blockchain and Sigfox internet of things (IoT) Integration for supply chain traceability where Sigfox does not need direct access to internet but can send low powered messages across long distances (for example shipping containers on the ocean). [@vanwassenaerTokenizingCircularityAgrifood2023] compares use cases for blockchains in enhancing traceability, transparency and cleaning up the supply chain in agricultural products.

-   Several startups are using to track source material arriving to the factories and product movements from factories to markets.

**Tracking Transport**

Products are made from resources distributed across the planet and transported to clients around the world which currently causes high levels (and increasing) of greenhouse gases. *"Transport greenhouse gas emissions have increased every year since 2014"* [@ClimateChangeMitigation2023]. Freight (transport of goods by trucks, trains, planes, ships) accounts for 1.14 gigatons of CO~2~ emissions as per 2015 data or 16% of total international supply chain emissions [@wangVolumeTradeinducedCrossborder2022].

| Type of Transport           | Percentage |
|-----------------------------|------------|
| Passenger cars              | 39%        |
| **Medium and heavy trucks** | 23%        |
| **Shipping**                | 11%        |

### Ethics & Cruelty

Can data transparency provide tools for reducing cruelty.

-   Traceability and animal rights. Animal rights vs animal welfare. Ethereum blockchain and animal rights. "Blockchain can provide a transparent, immutable record of the provenance of products. This can be especially useful for verifying claims made about animal welfare. For example, products claiming to be"free-range," "organic," or "sustainably sourced" could have their entire lifecycle recorded on the blockchain, from birth to shelf, allowing consumers to verify these claims."

### CO~2e~ Labels

Using Carbon Labels to Communicate CO~2~

Adding CO~2~ labels for consumer products have been discussed for decades [@adamcornerWhyWeNeed2012]. @cohenPotentialRoleCarbon2012 argues carbon labels do influence consumer choice towards sustainability. Academic literature has looked at even minute detail such as color and positioning of the label (@zhouCarbonLabelsHorizontal2019). There is some indication consumers are willing to pay a small premium for low-CO~2~ products (@xuLowcarbonEconomyCarbon2022). All else being equal, consumers choose the option with a lower CO~2~ number (@carlssonSustainableFoodCan2022). Nonetheless, the idea of *Carbon Labelling* is yet to find mainstream adoption.

There's some evidence to suggest labeling low CO~2~ food enables people to choose a *climatarian diet* in a large-scale study @lohmannCarbonFootprintLabels2022 of UK university students, however the impact of carbon labels on the market share of low-carbon meals is negligible. Labels alone are not enough. underlines @edenbrandtConsumerPerceptionsAttitudes2022 in Sweden in a study which found a negative correlation between worrying about climate impact and interest in climate information on products; this finding may be interpreted suggesting a need for wider environmental education programs. @asioliConsumersValuationCultured2022 found differences between countries, where Spanish and British consumers chose meat products with *'No antibiotics ever'* over a *Carbon Trust* label, whereas French consumers chose CO~2~ labeled meat products.

Carbon labeling is voluntary and practiced by only a handful of companies. The U.S. restaurant chain *Just Salad* , U.K.-based vegan meat-alternative *Quorn* and plant milk *Oatly* are some example of companies that provide carbon labeling on their products [@briankatemanCarbonLabelsAre2020]. [@climatepartnerLabellingCarbonFootprint2020]: Companies like ClimatePartner and Carbon Calories offers labeling consumer goods with emission data as a service. [@thecarbontrustHowReduceYour]: The Carbon Trust reports it's certified 27 thousand product footprints.

### Digital Product Passports

From Carbon Labels to Digital Product Passports

-   Circularise introduced an early blockchain-based sustainability system in 2016 aiming to improve transparency across several industries and is currently the market leader in providing *Digital Product Passports* @strettonDigitalProductPassports2022 "Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (part of the Sustainable Products Initiative) and one of the key actions under the Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP). The goal of this initiative is to lay the groundwork for a gradual introduction of a digital product passport in at least three key markets by 2024" "Connecting the Value Chain, One Product at a Time" "Circularise aims to overcome the communication barrier that is limiting the transition to a circular economy with an open, distributed and secure communications protocol based on blockchain technology."
-   product's history, composition, and environmental impact.

| Goal | Description |
|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Sustainable Product Production** |  |
| **Businesses to create value through Circular Business Models** |  |
| **Consumers to make more informed purchasing decisions** |  |
| **Verify compliance with legal obligations** |  |

: Digital Product Passport goals @strettonDigitalProductPassports2022

Digital product passports are a further development of the idea of carbon labels.

-   The European Commision has proposed a *Digital Product Passports* to help companies transfer environmental data [@nissinenMakeCarbonFootprints2022]. Carbon labels are needed for green transformation.

-   @reichDefiningGoalsProduct2023 "Information gaps are identified as one of the major obstacles to realizing a circular economy."

-   @jensenDigitalProductPassports2023 "support decision-making throughout product life cycles in favor of a circular economy."

-   @kingProposedUniversalDefinition2023 "influence consumer behavior towards sustainable purchasing and responsible product ownership by making apparent sustainability aspects of a product life cycle."

-   @bergerConfidentialitypreservingDataExchange2023 "support Sustainable Product Management by gathering and containing product life cycle data. However, some life cycle data are considered sensitive by stakeholders, leading to a reluctance to share such data."

-   @plociennikDigitalLifecyclePassport2022 "Digital Lifecycle Passport (DLCP) hosted on a cloud platform and can be accessed by producers, users, recyclers"

## Design Implications

| Category | Implication |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Greenwashing | Personal CO2 tracking is ineffective and the focus should be on systematic change towards circular design and zero waste practices. |
|  | App shows traceability. |
|  | Help consumers to demand more |
| Lack of transparency | Make open data easy to use in everyday life |
| Transparency | The key idea is making CO~2~ Visible. |
| Greenwashing | Rank companies based on sustainability |
|  | Help you to decide: what to buy, how to save, where to invest. |
| Decision Fatique | What if there was a "Green Filter" on every product everywhere? |
|  | Become a Sustainability-Aware App or Game. |
|  | Focus on how college students can invest in specific industries? |
|  | Where to shop rankings for groceries: list worst offenders in terms of products; shop and invest according to your values. |
|  | What Quantified Self look like for sustainability? |
|  | Empowering people to live a sustainable day |
|  | What if there was a "Green Filter" on every product everywhere? |
|  | Become a Sustainability-Aware App or Game. |
|  | Guidance could help young people beat climate anxiety by taking meaningful action. |
|  | The app is just as much about helping people deal with climate anxiety as it's with solving the climate issue. |
|  | List of metrics that should be tracked to enable useful analytics. Ex: % of beach pollution, air pollution, water pollution (I had this idea while meditating). In essence, "green filter" is a central data repository not unlike "Apple Health for Sustainability". |
|  | Health and fitness category apps |
|  | Using "green filter" you can get a personalized sustainability plan and personal coach to become healthy and nature-friendly. |
|  | All green categories --- Green hub --- Ask the user to prioritize |
|  | In my "green filter" AI advisor app's scenario, the AI is scanning for opportunities matching the user's sustainable investment appetite and risk profile, using different methods of analysis, including alternative data sources. Traditionally, financial analysts only looked at traditional data, such as company reports, government reports, historic performance, etc., for preparing advisory guidance to their clients. With the advent of AI and big data analysis, many other options of research data have become available, for example, accurate weather predictions for agriculture can affect guidance, because of expected future weather disasters in the area. Other examples include policy predictions, pollution metrics, etc. |
|  | Professional financial advisors use automated tools to analyze data and present it in human form to clients. Today's ubiquitous mobile interfaces, however, provide the opportunity to 'cut out the middleman' and provide similar information to clients directly, at a lower cost and a wider scale, often without human intervention. Additional (more expensive) "human-judgment- as-a-service", a combination of robots + human input, can help provide further personalized advice for the consumer, still at a cheaper price than a dedicated human advisor. Everyone can have a financial advisor. |
|  | Narrative design bring together film school **storytelling** experience with design. |
|  | Rebuilt the app as a personalized, narrative lifestyle feed. |
|  | Your shopping products mostly come from Protector and Gamble (3x) and Nestle. These are large conglomerates with a massive CO~2~ footprint. See the index to find some alternatives. |
|  | How the design can connect people to sustainable outcomes while shopping and investing? Perhaps even forming a community of sustainable action. What I showed in class looks like an app but it could also be a physical object (a speculative design). From the presentations I saw most students seemed to be interested in form and light (many lamps) and a couple were about medical uses. I don't remember seeing one that could be compatible with the environmental sustainability focus unfortunately... |
|  | **Guided Sustainability** "refers to a concept of using technology, such as AI and machine learning, to help individuals and organizations make more sustainable decisions and take actions that promote environmental and social sustainability. This can include things like analyzing data on resource usage and emissions, providing recommendations for reducing the environmental impact of operations, or helping to identify and track progress towards sustainability goals. The goal of guided sustainability is to make it easier for people to understand their impact on the environment and to take steps to reduce that impact." |
|  | Young people are stuck inside platforms. You don't own the data you put on TikTok. You can't leave because you'll lose the audience. |
|  | With this perspective of scale, what would a shopping experience look like if one knew at the point of sale, which products are greener, and which are more environmentally polluting? |
|  | AI Financial Advisors will need to go further to motivate users. because of the nature of the technology, which is based on the quality of the data the systems ingest, they are prone to mistakes. |
| Generative AI | Allow producers to make use of Speculative and Participatory design to test out new product ideas? |
