## Eco-Design: The Legislative Perspective

In Europe, *eco-design* has strong political support from the European Union as part of the "Green Deal" set of legislation, aiming to transform European economies towards sustainability. The Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR) entered into force in the EU on July 18, 2024 [@europeancommissionEcodesignSustainableProducts2024] following the [@europeanparliamentEcodesignSustainableProducts2022] proposal in 2022 whereby the European Commission established a general framework for *eco-design: "requirements for sustainable products, repealing rules currently in force which concentrate on energy-related products only,"* setting up ta level playing-field for the organizations operating on the EU market. Virginijus Sinkevičius, the EU Commissioner for the Environment, Oceans and Fisheries, is quoted describing eco-design as design that *"respects the boundaries of our planet"* [@europeancommissionGreenDealNew2022].

## How to Design for Sustainability: A Diversity of Approaches

*Designing for Sustainability* *(DfS)* has many names, with subtle differences of emphasis and nuance. While the ESPR regulation chose *Eco-Design* as the overarching title, researchers and practitioners discuss and use *Circular Design*, *Cradle-to-Cradle Design*, *Green Design*, *Regenerative Design*, *Climate-Responsive Design*, *Life-Centered Design*, and many others.

In most cases, designing for sustainability makes use of *systems thinking*, underlining the importance of looking at the entire lifecycle of a product or service. Sustainable design encompasses all human activities, making this pursuit an over-arching challenge across all industries and all human activities with the complex interdependencies contained within. [@ceschinEvolutionDesignSustainability2016] gives a comprehensive overview of the main themes of sustainable design and the main contributions and limitations in the well–researched *"Evolution of design for sustainability: From product design to design for system innovations and transitions"*.

```{python}

```

As this research is *practice-oriented* (i.e., my goal here is to find design approaches that could provide context for and at the end of the day - influence my prototype), I will refrain myself to looking at some key design fields which I find relevant to my project.

*Human-Centered Design*, the grandfather of design with attitude. There's an ISO standard for human-centered design, with the designated code ISO9241-210, revised as ISO 9241-210:2019 and up for revision as ISO standards are reviewed every 5 years [@2019HumancentredDesignInteractive].

*Life-Centered Design* recognizes human impact on our surrounding environment as well as non-human animals making sure to include them among stakeholders. While *Human-Centered Design* has become popular, the effect humans are having on biodiversity should be considered when designing. *"\[T\]he design phase of a physical product accounts for 80% of its environmental impact"* notes[@borthwickHumancentredLifecentredDesign2022] in their framework for life-centered design.

*Designing for Trust*, @weinschenk100ThingsEvery2011 says *"People expect most online interactions to follow the same social rules as person-to-person interactions. It's a shortcut that your brain uses to quickly evaluate trustworthiness."*

*Climate-Responsive Design* embeds a building within the environmental constraints of a place and looks for opportunities use the land, wind, sun, local materials, and local vernacular history and culture when considering a design. Architect Susanne Brorson suggests sustainability should be considered in the earlier phases of design instead of trying to fix problems later discussing *climate-responsive design principles* [@evmmaaarhitektuurikeskusClimateresponsiveDesignPrinciples2019]. The sentiment is echoed by [@leeAestheticsSustainableArchitecture2011] who edited a volume on sustainable approaches of world-renowned architects: "The principles of sustainable design are rooted in the building’s relationship to the site and its environmental conditions such as topography, vegetation, and climate."

*Biomimicry* is about being inspired by nature while *Biodesign* focuses on design involving biology in the design itself. Janine Benyus, who coined the word *Biomimicry* [@benyusBiomimicryInnovationInspired2009] looks at very practical cases of innovation where engineers and biologist meet and [@dicksBiomimicryRevolutionLearning2023] provides a much more philosophical account of following the example of nature. In a similar vein, *Material Ecology* is the wording preferred by the architect Neri Oxman based at the MIT Media Lab working with biomaterials as a proponent of *Nature-Centric Design* that adheres to the principles of ecological sustainability with both an ecologically conscious mindset and practical toolset [@henczNeriOxmanMaterial2022]. Neri Oxman's expressions in her [@worldeconomicforumBioInspiredDesignNeri2016] interview: "ecology-indifferent", "naturing", "mother naturing", "design is a practice of letting go of all that is unnecessary", "nature should be our single client" remind me how language shapes human thinking. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is a source of many fantastic innovations, and another

*Cradle-to-Cradle Design*, focusing on recyclability of products. @TaiWanSheJiYanJiuYuanTDRIInstagram2021 and @HuoDongTongBeiOuXunHuanSheJiLunTanNordicCircular Cradle to Cradle Nordic circular design in Taiwan

Focusing on the financial sector, [@thomasDesignFinancialSustainability2022]'s philosophical account advocates for an "inside-out" design pattern, much like natural systems, starting from the smallest structures to guarantee resilience and survival, instead of trying to control their external environment.

*Regenerative Design* suggests *de*materializing (digitizing) economies is not enough. Design should look for avenues to *regenerate* damaged or even completely destroyed natural systems – ecosystems, biodiversity, land, forests, lakes, rivers - natural habitats.

*Service Design*, @ceschinEvolutionDesignSustainability2016 shows how design for sustainability has expanded from a product focus to systems-thinking focus placing the product inside a societal context of use. For example @CargoBikeFREITAG, recycled clothing maker FREITAG offers sustainability-focused services such ass cargo bikes so you can transport your purchases and a network for *shopping without payment* = swapping your items with other members, as well as repairs of their products. Loaning terminology from *service design*, the user journey within an app needs to consider each touchpoint on the way to a state of success.

*Durability* is an important dimension for sustainability. High quality durable products are more sustainable as they last longer and less likely to be thrown away. Forming an emotional bond with the product makes it feel more valuable [@zonneveldEmotionalConnectionsObjects2014]. [@chapmanDesignEmotionalDurability2009] argues in his seminal paper (and later in his book) for *"Emotionally Durable Design"*, the simple idea that we hold to things we value and thus they are sustainable. We don't throw away a necklace gifted to us by mom, indeed this object might be passed down for centuries. [@roseEnchantedObjectsInnovation2015] has a similar idea, where *"Enchanted Objects"* become so interlinked with us, we're unlikely to throw them away. This has implications for sustainability as the object is less likely to be thrown away.

As the above shows, there are many partially overlapping design words created by different people for diverse purposes. Design vocabulary may be created for distinguishing a particular type of design from another - or to market oneself as the creator of the word. Here I will use the lens of *sustainability* - another complex term - to look at how design can contribute to eco-friendly products. I advocate looking at design methods as a toolbox, where I can pick the tool suitable for the problem set in front of me. Here I look at a small number of design practices I find relevant to designing a sustainability app for college students.

than traditional design methods. While AI allows us to look at a larger number of design scenarios thank previously feasible, there are many approaches looking for ways to design for sustainability. Designing for Sustainability is fundamentally a hopeful act imbibed with the dream a healthier world is possible.

There are designers who define / brand themselves by their design method,

Design Studies, a field that studies *design* as a subject.

Architecture of the Well-Tempered Environment [@banhamArchitectureWelltemperedEnvironment1999]

## Future Scenarios: Avoiding the Worst Cases

In sustainability there are rarely good choices. Rather it's a question of avoiding the worst choices.

*Scenario-building* is a key tool for sustainability. Because sustainability is so complex, sustainable design makes use of scenarios.

*Life Cycle Assessment* and *Environmental Impact Analysis* are needed to provide eco-design scenarios [@DELAPUENTEDIAZDEOTAZU2022718].

*Speculative Design* makes use of future scenarios to envision contexts and interactions of use. First introduced by [@dunneSpeculativeEverythingDesign2013] in their seminal book, the field aims to question the intersection of *user experience design* and *speculative fiction*. [@BARENDREGT2021374] explores the potential of speculative design to stimulate public engagement; thought experiments can spur public debate on an issue chosen by the designer. Phil Balagtas, founder of The Design Futures Initiative at McKinsey, discusses the value of building future scenarios at his talk at Google. His favorite example, the Apple Knowledge Navigator, first appeared in an Apple vision video in 1987 and took two decades to materialize in the real world. It was inspired by a similar device first shown in a 1970s episode of Star Trek as a *magic device* (a term from participatory design), which then inspired subsequent consumer product development. It took another two decades, until the launch of the iPhone in 2007 - a total of 40 years.

user experience, iteration [@googledesignDesignSpeculativeFutures2019]

Speculative design can help us imagine *non-anthropocentric* [@hupkesShiftingNonanthropocentrismDialogue2022; @edwardsSpeculativeDesignEnvisioning2023]as well as *dystopian* futures [@pintoCreationDystopiasAlternative2021].

*Participatory Design* and Speculative Design can be complementary as in the work of [@neuhoffFormsParticipatoryFuturing2023], used together to focus on engaging users deep in the design process to truly understand their needs on a non-superficial level. For both speculative and participatory design, the cost makes it into a niche activity. Generative AI holds the promise to allow designers to dream up and prototype quicker. In order to build a future, it's relevant to imagine and critique a future. By being quickly generate prototypes, once can test out ideas with the future users involving more of the community and stakeholders. To be able to build something, one first needs to imagine it; imagination is crucial for change.

## In Practice Sustainability Begins in Software

Designing user interfaces for sustainable interactions means incorporating data and toolsets to enable designers to make decisions which reduce emissions of their design. Companies like AutoDesk are putting CO~2~ calculations inside their design software, helping designers reduce material usage, energy consumption, CO~2~ emissions, while increasing recyclability[@mikehaleySustainabilityStartsDesign2022]. Software is key to building more sustainable products, already for decades [@guptaAnalysisArtificialIntelligencebased2023]. AI-assisted design enables design for sustainability because the design process is where sustainability begins. AI has the potential to provide the parameters for sustainability. [@singhArtificialNeuralNetwork2023] proposes an AI tool for deciding the suitable life cycle design parameters.

Design encompasses most everything in our daily lives. Humans live in artificial environments where *most* *things* are designed by humans. The *experiences* we take part in are increasingly created based on some type of data.

## Data-Driven Design Enables Sustainable Personalizaton at Scale

Data-Driven Design Enables Sustainability. Sustainability touches every facet of human existence and is thus an enormous undertaking. Making progress on sustainability is only possible if there's a large-scale coordinated effort by humans around the planet. For this to happen, appropriate technological tools are required.

Data-driven design has limitations.

## Digital Platform Economy: Growth Leads to Superapps

Platform economy companies popularized and expanded Data-Driven Design in the service of growth marketing (also known colloquially as growth hacking). Capturing User Data was part of this strategy which enabled improving the products. Digital Product Design is increasingly data-driven. Digital platforms operate a *design as a process* in a continuous feedback loop, where *measurements*, *experiments,* predictive analytics and personalization form a data-drive design culture. As we humans go about our daily business, governments and companies track our activities using various technologies, which produces massive amounts of user interaction data. Platform economy companies are the capture and use large amounts of data from users. Data is useful for designing better products. Designing for high retention (users keep coming back). Network Effects, the more people use a platform, the more valuable it becomes. Platforms that continuously add features (provided consumer legislation allows it) may eventually evolve into superapps, which are useful for providing services for a wide category of human needs. Bundling many services under one super-brand. Superapps are possible thanks to Nudge, Economies of Scale, Network Effects, Behaviour Design. Large Digital Platforms have a very small number of workers relative to the number of users they serve. This creates the necessity for using automation for both understanding user needs and providing the service itself. Creating a good product that's useful for the large majority of users depends on *Data-Driven Design.*

Design is as much about how it works as it's about the interface.

Digital product design can be seen as a specific discipline under the umbrella of Experience Design. In @michaelabrashInventingFuture2017 Meta Oculus augmented reality incubation general manager Laura Fryer: *"People buy experiences, not technology."*

Young people expect a product. Intelligent Interfaces use interaction design to provide relevant and personalized information in the right context and at the right time.

There are many approaches to design - from playful to practical to critical and to data-driven. Nonetheless, many types of design share a common goal designing for a good *user experience*. Simplifying.

*Personalization*: the largest businesses today (measured in number of users) design the whole user experience.

*Scale,* Popular consumer platforms strive to design solutions that feel personalized at every touchpoint on the user journey (to use the language of service design) at the scale of hundreds of billions of users.

Superapps are honeypots of data that is used for many types of behavior modeling. [@suarezEnhancingUserIncome2021] suggests using alternative data from super-apps to estimate user income levels, including 4 types of data: Personal Information, Consumption Patterns, Payment Information, and Financial services. [@roaSuperappBehavioralPatterns2021] finds super-app alternative data is especially useful for credit-scoring young, low-wealth individuals. The massive amounts of data generated by these companies are used by smart cities to re-design their physical environments.

Twitter (now X) is becoming a financial app.

### Behavioral Design

Aka Gamification

For decades, marketers and researchers have been researching how to affect human behavior towards increasing purchase decisions in commerce, both offline and online, which is why the literature on behavioral design is massive. One of the key concepts is *nudge*, first coined in 2008 by the Nobel-winning economist Richard Thaler; nudges are based on a scientific understanding of human psychology and shortcuts and triggers that human brains use and leverages that knowledge to influence humans in small but powerful ways [@thalerNudgeImprovingDecisions2009].

The principles of nudge have also been applied to sustainability. For example, a small study (n=33) in the Future Consumer Lab in Copenhagen by [@perez-cuetoNudgingPlantbasedMeals2021] found that designing a "dish-of-the-day" which was prominently displayed helped to increase vegetarian food choice by 85%. Experiments by [@GUATH2022101821] focused on environmentally friendly online purchases in Sweden (n=200) suggest nudging can be effective in influencing online shopping behavior towards more sustainable options. A study of behavior change in Australia at large university setting (N = 156) by [@novoradovskayaMyCupTea2021] found nudging behavioral change had a significant effect and the author suggested it may help to avoid some of the *"16 billion paper coffee cups are being thrown away every year"* globally (based on the abstract - I was unable to access the full paper).

Google uses nudges in Google Flights and Google Maps, which allow filtering flights and driving routes by the amount of CO~2~ emissions, as well as surfacing hotels with Green Key and EarthCheck credentials, while promising new sustainability features across its portfolio of products [@sundarpichaiGivingYouMore2021]. Such tools are small user interface nudges which Google's research calls *digital decarbonization*, defined by [@implementconsultinggroupHowDigitalSector2022] as *"Maximising the enabling role of digital technologies by accelerating already available digital solutions"*.

In [@katebrandtGoogleClimateAction2022], Google's Chief Sustainability Officer Kate Brandt set a target of "at least 20-25%" CO~2~ emission reductions in Europe to reach a net-zero economy and the global announcement set a target of helping 1 billion people make more sustainable choices around the world [@jenimilesBecomingSustainabilityAwareApp2022]. In addition to end--users, Google offers digital decarbonization software for developers, including the Google Cloud Carbon Footprint tool and invests in regenerative agriculture projects [@GoogleRegenerativeAgriculture2021; @googleCarbonFootprint2023].

### Open Data Sharing

Open Data Enables Collaboration

-   Taiwan is a proponent of Open Gov OP-MSF OGP [@opengovernmentpartnershipOGPParticipationCoCreation2021; @labTaiwanTakesActions2021]

Data-driven design requires access to data. making the movement towards *open data sharing* very important. Some countries and cities are better than others at sharing data openly.

| Country | Project                  | Reference           |

### Data Privacy

Sustainability needs to be balanced with privacy.

-   @sanchezGreenBearLoRaWANbased2022 suggests tracking users using their smartphones and attributing points for actions deemed beneficial yet this has potentially privacy issues.

## Self-Monitoring: Personal Health Insights

Research on *personal data tracking* also known as *quantified self* or *self-monitoring* is abundant. Wearable devices including the Apple Watch, Oura Ring, Fitbit and others, combined with apps, help users track a variety of health metrics. Apart from health, wearable devices have been used to track other metrics such as physiological parameters of students at school to determine their learning efficiency [@giannakosFitbitLearningCapturing2020]. Not only can health metrics be tracking, but exposure to pollution as well as personal carbon footprint, are all to some extent trackable (if not traceable).

### Carbon Tracking

Personal carbon footprint tracking apps (aka CO2 calculators) in a mid-sized German city (N=216) helped overall emission reduction by 23% correlating with feedback from the app specifically reducing emissions from heating 26.9%, food 16.4%, household 34.7% reduction, and mobility 12%[@hoffmannCarbonFootprintTracking2024].

We have a limited carbon budget so calculating CO2e-cost become integrated into every activity.

-   CO2e calculations will be part of our everyday experience

-   Personal carbon footprint calculators have been released online, ranging from those made by governments and companies to student projects.

-   Zhang's Personal Carbon Economy conceptualized the idea of carbon as a currency used for buying and selling goods and services, as well as an individual carbon exchange to trade one's carbon permits [@zhangPersonalCarbonEconomy2018].

Personal Carbon Trackers

Similar to personal health trackers, personal CO~2~ trackers help one track emissions and suggests sustainable actions.

### Pollution Exposure Tracking

My personal air pollution exposure tracked using the Atmotube device attached to my backpack. Tracking air pollution and realizing how bad the over in my grandma's house is: add picture. Quantified Self is an example of Digital Health. There is a parallel in health to sustainability and indeed both are inextricably linked. Open Source code for calculating air pollution exposure AQI [@atmotechAtmotubeAqipy2024].

```{python}
air_chart()
```

### Health Tracking

EEG (electroencephalogram), ECG (Electrocardiogram), EDA (Electrodermal Activity): tracking features of brain, heart and nervous system activity. Brain Music Lab founder and brain researcher Grace Leslie: "brain music sounds like a warm bathtub". Tracking blood sugar with app and patches. Blood sugar trackers. Blood glucose tracking is popular even for people without diabetes, to optimize their activity [@BloodSugarMonitoring2021]. Tracking urine consistency inside your toilet with WithThings. Companies like NeuralLink are building devices to build meaningful interactions from brain waves (EEG).

Apple is a leader in health tracking. In 2022 Apple outlined plans for *"empowering people to live a healthier day"* and Apple's HealthKit provides a growing list of health metrics, which app developers can tap into [@appleEmpoweringPeopleLive2022; @appleWhatNewHealthKit2022]. @liuHowPhysicalExercise2019 tracks how wearable data is used for tracking sleep improvements from exercise. @grigsby-toussaintSleepAppsBehavioral2017 made use of sleep apps to construct humans behaviors also known as *behavioral constructs*. The Oura ring is an example of *calm technology*, providing helpful data without calling an attention to itself [@phelanOuraRingCEO2024].

Use technology Wearables to be more aware of one's health. Example of quantified self device.

### Fitness Tracking

fitness metrics

Could one track personal sustainability in a similar fashion? [@shinWearableActivityTrackers2019]'s synthesis review of 463 studies shows wearable devices have potential to influence behavior change towards healthier lifestyles. @saubadePromotingPhysicalActivity2016 finds health tracking is useful for motivating physical activity. The urban environment has an influence on health.

While so of the behavior changes may sound simple - like switching from driving to walking - and would have a large environmental effect, they are hindered by factors from personal motivation to (lack of) suitable urban architecture. [@delclos-alioWalkingTransportationLarge2022] discusses walking in Latin-American cities. Walking is the most sustainable method or transport but requires the availability of city infrastructure, such as sidewalks, which many cities still lack.

Personal data enables behavior change.

While the scale of climate change is too big for individual action to make a difference, individual action can foster hope and a sense of collective responsibility [@natureIndividualActionSystemic2020].

-   @kristiansteensennielsenArgumentsIndividualClimate2022 **Individual climate action!!!**

-   The UN has been handing out Global Climate Action Awards since 2011 for idea such as the Climate Credit Card in Switzerland, which automatically tracks emissions of purchases, creates emissions' reports for the user which can then be offset with investments in climate projects around the world [@unfcccClimateCreditCard2023].

-   @GreenFintechTrends2020 report predicts the rise of personalizing sustainable finance, because of its potential to grow customer loyalty, through improving the user experience. Similarly to good design, interacting with sustainable finance for the 'green-minded' demographics, providing a reliable green product is a way to build customer loyalty.

Another aspect is tracking one's mental health. [@tylerContemporarySelfreflectivePractices2022] surveys the use of self-reflection apps in the UK (n=998).

The small screen estate space of mobiles phones and smart watches necessitates displaying content in a dynamic manner. Virtual reality glasses (called AR/VR or XR in marketing speak) need dynamic content because the user is able to move around the environment. These are questions that interaction design is called upon to solve. @hoangEnterDynamicIsland2022: *"Dynamic interfaces might invoke a new design language for extended reality".*

Speaking is one mode of interaction that's become increasingly possible as machines learn to interpret human language.

: Modes of interaction

## Re-Designing Industries for Circular Economy

We're in an industrial revolution. Many companies are investing into transforming their processes. *"\[T\]ransition to a low carbon economy presents challenges and potential economic benefits that are comparable to those of previous industrial revolutions"* [@pearsonLowCarbonIndustrial2012]. It's possible to re-design entire industries and that is exactly the expectation sustainability sets on businesses. Across all industries, there's a call for more transparency. Conversations about sustainability are too general and one needs to look at the specific sustainability metrics at specific industries to be able to design for meaningful interaction. There's plentiful domain-specific research showing how varied industries can develop eco-designed products. I will here focus on 3 industries that are relevant for college students.

Food and clothes (I'm omitting housing and transport here) are part of the immediate environmental impact of college students.

### Circular Economy

Circular economy is a tiny part of the world economy. [@circleeconomyCircularityGapReport2022] reports only 8.6% of world economy is circular and *100B tonnes of virgin materials* are sourced every year.

Encouraging Sustainable Design and Reducing Waste.

[@liuGlobalPerspectiveEwaste2023] reports, e-waste is growing 3%-5% every year, globally. [@thukralExploratoryStudyProducer2023] identifies several barriers to e-waste management among producers including lack of awareness and infrastructure, attitudinal barriers, existing *informal* e-waste sector, and the need for an e-waste license.

### Case: Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG)

Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) also known as Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) are large global congloremates operating with low margins and high volumes [@tohFastForwardEverything2024]. The largest of them have several billions in revenue [@kentonFastMovingConsumerGoods2024].

```{python}
fast_consumer_goods()
```

Rise of e-commerce has pushed logistics companies to increase delivery efficiency to keep up with FMCG sales [@deliverectDeliverectUSWhat2024].

### Case: Fast Fashion

Just like Fast-Moving Consumer Goods, fast fashion operates with low margins and follows consumer trends. Young people are the largest consumers of fast fashion [@YoungConsumersComplicated]. [In @europeanenvironmentagencyTextilesEnvironmentRole2022 European Environment Agency (EEA)] estimates based on trade and production data that EU27 citizens consumed an average 15kg of textile products per person per year. The European Commission wants to reduce the impact of fast fashion on EU market [@errKomisjonTahabVahendada2022]. [@millward-hopkinsMaterialFlowAnalysis2023] shows how 50% of the textile waste in the UK is exported to other countries.

"26 million tons of clothing end up in China’s landfills each year, propelled by fast fashion" [@tianmacleodjiFastFashionDominates2024].

Greenwashing is prevalent in the fashion industry. **Problem**: @emilychanWeStillDon2022 report says there's not enough transparency in fashion. @fashionrevolutionfoundationFASHIONTRANSPARENCYINDEX2022 Fashion transparency index. [@wikirateSharingDataCreating2022]: "Among the Index's main goals are to help different stakeholders to better understand what data and information is being disclosed by the world's largest fashion brands and retailers, raise public awareness, educate citizens about the social and environmental challenges facing the global fashion industry and support people's activism". Consumer understanding of sustainability is limited. @mabuzaNaturalSyntheticDyes2023 shows consumer knowledge of apparel coloration is very limited.

2.4 Trillion USD fashion industry contributing 2%-8% of total global GHG emissions, 100B USD lost to lack of recycling, contributes 9% of microplastics [@adamkiewiczGreenwashingSustainableFashion2022]. [@centobelliSlowingFastFashion2022] Fashion industry year uses 9B cubic meters of water, 1.7B tonnes of CO~2~, 92 million tonnes of textile waste. @kohlerCircularEconomyPerspectives2021 Globally 87% of textile products are burned or landfilled after 1st consumer use.

#### Towards Sustainable Clothes

-   There are local policy initiatives aiming to tackle the waste problem. For example the New Standard Institute's proposed "Fashion Act" to require brands doing business in New York City to disclose sustainability data and set waste reduction targets [@emilychanWill2022Be2022] .

-   [@leungGreenDesign2021] There's a growing know-how on how to produce sustainably and which materials to use. "Handbook of Footwear Design and Manufacture" Chapter 18 - Green design. Industry collaboration can raise the bar for everyone, such as the Better Cotton Initiative [@bettercottonBetterCottonAnnual2023].

-   Story of Patagonia [@chouinardLetMyPeople2005]\].

Sustainable Fashion, Textile Design

-   There are signs of young Chinese consumers valuing experiences over possessions [@jiangHowHaveCovid2023].

Across industries, reports are saying there isn't enough transparency.

### Case: Towards Sustainable Food

Re-designing industrial food systems for an increasing global population is a challenge. Supply chain innovation in food industries may enable more transparency. **provenance and traceability of food has implications for sustainability and health.**

Global warming leading to droughts and extreme weather, wars and conflicts increased volatility in food prices [@eshenelsonHeatWarTrade2023].

"The agricultural sector contributes to approximately 13.5% of the total global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and accounts for 25% of the total CO~2~ emission" [@nabipourafrouziComprehensiveReviewCarbon2023]. @pooreReducingFoodEnvironmental2018 suggests 26% of carbon emissions come from food production. @FoodPrints2015 reports dairy (46%) and meat and fish (29%) products making up the largest GHG emission potential. @springmannGlobalRegionalCosts2021 proposes veganism is the most effective decision to reduce personal CO~2~ emissions.

*Farm to Fork* is a European Union policy to shorten the supply chain from the producer to the consumer and add transparency to the system. @patelBlockchainTechnologyFood2023 livestock products (meat) are 15% of agricultural foods valued at €152 billion in 2018 globally.

**Fishing**

-   75% of fishing is done using industrial Trawling, which has environmental impact

-   @baileyMappingActorsArguments2020 shows how the Norwegian government plans to increase salmon production 5x by 2050. How can this be sustainable? Mostly this means fish-farming

-   Complex supply chains make seafood (marine Bivalvia, mollusks) logistics prone to fraud, leading to financial losses and threats to consumer health [@santosCurrentTrendsTraceability2023]. [@changAuthenticationFishSpecies2021] *fish fraud* is a large global problem but it's possible to use DNA-tracking to prove where the fish came from. In "2019, the 27 KURA SUSHI branches in Taiwan sold more than 46 million plates of sushi. in Taiwan". Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IIU) fishing is widespread; the EU is adopting countermeasures [@kimEconomicImpactsEuropean2024]. @munozCarbonFootprintEconomic2023 Is there such a thing as sustainable fishing? Bottom trawling is the worst and should be banned. @katiegustafsonWhyTracingSeafood2022 proposes a **"Uniform traceability system for the entire supply chain"** for seafood. @mamedeElementalFingerprintingSea2022 proposes *Seafood tracing*: Fingerprinting of Sea Urchin.

-   The same is true for cocoa beans, which are at risk from food fraud [@fanningLinkingCocoaQuality2023].

-   **Perennial Crops,** Multi-year crops reduce inputs of gasoline, labor, etc. [@aubreystreitkrugPathwaysPerennialFood2023]. Large agritech companies like Monsanto rely on selling seeds annually for profits putting them at odds with **Perennial crops**. Single-year seeds have led to farmer suicides when crops fail in poor communities.

### Circular Design

Circular design is only possible if supply chains become circular as well.

It's important in which structure data is stored, affecting the ability to efficiently access and manage the data while guaranteeing a high level of data integrity, security, as well as energy usage of said data.

The complexity of resource and delivery networks necessitates more advanced tools to map supply chains [@knightFutureBusinessRole2022]. The COVID19 pandemic and resulting blockages in resource delivery highlighted the need to have real-time visibility into supply chains [@finkenstadtBlurryVisionSupply2021].

Blockchains are a type of shared database where the data is stored in several locations with a focus on making the data secure and very difficult to modify after it's been written to the database. Once data is written to the blockchain, modifying it would require changing all subsequent records in the chain and agreement of the majority of validators who host a version of the database. Blockchain is the main technology considered for accounting for the various inputs and complex web of interactions between many participants inside the supply chain networks. There are hundreds of paper researching blockchain use in supply change operations since 2017 [@duttaBlockchainTechnologySupply2020]. Blockchains enable saving immutable records into distributed databases (also known as ledgers). It's not possible to (or extremely difficult) to change the same record, only new records can be added on top of new ones. Blockchains are useful for data sharing and auditing, as the time and place of data input can be guaranteed, and it will be easier to conduct a search on who inputted incorrect data; however the system still relies on correct data input. As the saying goes, *"garbage in, garbage out"*.

There are several technologies for tracking goods across the supply chain, from shipping to client delivery. Data entry is a combination of manual data input and automated record-keeping facilitated by sensors and integrated internet of things (IoT) capabilities. For example [@ashrafPrototypeSupplyChain2023] describes using the Solana blockchain and Sigfox internet of things (IoT) Integration for supply chain traceability where Sigfox does not need direct access to internet but can send low powered messages across long distances (for example shipping containers on the ocean). [@vanwassenaerTokenizingCircularityAgrifood2023] compares use cases for blockchains in enhancing traceability, transparency and cleaning up the supply chain in agricultural products.

**Tracking Transport Supply Chains**

Products are made from resources distributed across the planet and transported to clients around the world which currently causes high levels (and increasing) of greenhouse gases. *"Transport greenhouse gas emissions have increased every year since 2014"* [@ClimateChangeMitigation2023]. Freight (transport of goods by trucks, trains, planes, ships) accounts for 1.14 gigatons of CO~2~ emissions as per 2015 data or 16% of total international supply chain emissions [@wangVolumeTradeinducedCrossborder2022].

| Type of Transport           | Percentage |
|-----------------------------|------------|
| Passenger cars              | 39%        |
| **Medium and heavy trucks** | 23%        |
| **Shipping**                | 11%        |

### Extended Producer Responsibility

Extended Producer Responsibility Enables Companies to be Resposible.

Popular blogs such as [@kohliHowDesignersCan2019] and [@loseWaysUXDesign2023] offer many suggestions how designers can help people become more sustainable in their daily lives yet focusing on the end-user neglects the producers' responsibility (termed as Extended Producer Responsibility or ERP) in waste management studies.

Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is a policy tool first proposed by Thomas Lindhqvist in Sweden in 1990 \[ADD CITATION\], aimed to encourage producers take responsibility for the entire life-cycle of their products, thus leading to more eco-friendly products. Nonetheless, EPR schemes do not guarantee circularity and may instead be designed around fees to finance waste management in linear economy models [@christiansenExtendedProducerResponsibility2021]. The French EPR scheme was upgraded in 2020 to become more circular [@jacquesvernierExtendedProducerResponsibility2021]. In July 2024, Latvia was the 4th EU country to join an textile-EPR scheme [@NewEPRRequirements2024].

In any case, strong consumer legislation (such as EPR) has a direct influence on producers' actions. For example, in @hktdcresearchFranceExpandsProducer2022, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council notified textile producers in July 2022 reminding factories to produce to French standards in order to be able enter the EU market. @pengExtendedProducerResponsibility2023 finds that the ***Carbon Disclosure Project*** has been a crucial tool to empower ERP in Chinese auto-producers.

-   The success of EPR can vary per type of product. For car tires, the EPR scheme in the Netherlands claims a 100% recovery rate @campbell-johnstonHowCircularYour2020.

One type of legislation that works?

-   [@steenmansFosteringCircularEconomy2023] Argues for the need to engage companies through legislation and shift from waste-centered laws to product design regulations.

-   In Europe, there's large variance between member states when in comes to textile recycling: while Estonia and France are the only EU countries where separate collection of textiles is required by law, in Estonia 100% of the textiles were burned in an incinerator in 2018 while in France textiles are covered by an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme leading to higher recovery rates (Ibid).

## Designing Digital Product Passports

Even though this topic belongs under Circular Economy, I've chose to highlight *digital product passports* here as it's the main design implication from this chapter - an emerging technology which needs to be designed for the user.

I will being with a bit of history to contextualize what has already been tried. CO~2e~ labeling initiatives are an early form of communicating the environmental cost of each product. Using carbon labels to communicate CO~2e~ emission of consumer products has been a topic of discussion for decades [@adamcornerWhyWeNeed2012]. Academic literature has looked at minute details such as color and positioning of the label [@zhouCarbonLabelsHorizontal2019]. There's some indication consumers are willing to pay a small premium for low-CO~2e~ products; all else being equal, consumers choose the option with a lower CO~2e~ number [@xuLowcarbonEconomyCarbon2022; @carlssonSustainableFoodCan2022]. [@cohenPotentialRoleCarbon2012] argues labeling the carbon footprint of products does help inform consumer choice towards sustainability and help promote a green economy. A large-scale study of UK university students finds some evidence to suggest labeling low CO~2e~ food enables people to choose a *climatarian diet*, however the impact of carbon labels on the market share of low-carbon meals is negligible [@lohmannCarbonFootprintLabels2022].

Labels alone are not enough. A study in Sweden underlines a negative correlation between worrying about climate impact and interest in climate information on products [@edenbrandtConsumerPerceptionsAttitudes2022]. This latter finding may be interpreted to suggest a need for wider environmental education programs among consumers. [@asioliConsumersValuationCultured2022] found differences between countries, where Spanish and British consumers chose meat products with *'No antibiotics ever'* over a *Carbon Trust* label, whereas French consumers chose CO~2~ labeled meat products.

however several studies show their effect is negligible. Nonetheless, the idea of *Carbon Labelling* is yet to find mainstream adoption.

Carbon labeling is voluntary. Only a handful of companies practice carbon-labeling but the number is growing. The U.S. restaurant chain *Just Salad* , U.K.-based vegan meat-alternative *Quorn* and plant milk *Oatly* are some example of companies that provide carbon labeling on their products [@briankatemanCarbonLabelsAre2020]. [@climatepartnerLabellingCarbonFootprint2020]: Companies like ClimatePartner and Carbon Calories offers labeling consumer goods with emission data as a service. [@thecarbontrustHowReduceYour]: The Carbon Trust reports it's certified 27 thousand product footprints.

: Digital Product Passport goals @strettonDigitalProductPassports2022

Digital product passports are a further development of the idea of carbon labels.

-   The European Commision has proposed a *Digital Product Passports* to help companies transfer environmental data [@nissinenMakeCarbonFootprints2022]. Carbon labels are needed for green transformation.

-   @reichDefiningGoalsProduct2023 "Information gaps are identified as one of the major obstacles to realizing a circular economy."

-   @jensenDigitalProductPassports2023 "support decision-making throughout product life cycles in favor of a circular economy."

-   @kingProposedUniversalDefinition2023 "influence consumer behavior towards sustainable purchasing and responsible product ownership by making apparent sustainability aspects of a product life cycle."

-   @bergerConfidentialitypreservingDataExchange2023 "support Sustainable Product Management by gathering and containing product life cycle data. However, some life cycle data are considered sensitive by stakeholders, leading to a reluctance to share such data."

|                      | In my "green filter" AI advisor app's scenario, the AI is scanning for opportunities matching the user's sustainable investment appetite and risk profile, using different methods of analysis, including alternative data sources. Traditionally, financial analysts only looked at traditional data, such as company reports, government reports, historic performance, etc., for preparing advisory guidance to their clients. With the advent of AI and big data analysis, many other options of research data have become available, for example, accurate weather predictions for agriculture can affect guidance, because of expected future weather disasters in the area. Other examples include policy predictions, pollution metrics, etc. |

|                      | Professional financial advisors use automated tools to analyze data and present it in human form to clients. Today's ubiquitous mobile interfaces, however, provide the opportunity to 'cut out the middleman' and provide similar information to clients directly, at a lower cost and a wider scale, often without human intervention. Additional (more expensive) "human-judgment- as-a-service", a combination of robots + human input, can help provide further personalized advice for the consumer, still at a cheaper price than a dedicated human advisor. Everyone can have a financial advisor.                                                                                                                                            |
