<td>Monolithicity</td>
<td>LLMs are massive monolithic models requiring large amounts of computing power for training to offer <strong><em>multi-modal</em></strong> <strong><em>capabilities</em></strong> across diverse domains of knowledge, making training such models possible for very few companies. <span class="citation" data-cites="liuPrismerVisionLanguageModel2023">@liuPrismerVisionLanguageModel2023</span> proposes future AI models may instead consist of a number networked domain-specific models to increase efficiency and thus become more scalable.</td>

<td>Opaqueness</td>
<td>LLMs are opaque, making it difficult to explain why a certain prediction was made by the AI model. One visible expression of this problem are <em><strong>hallucinations</strong>,</em> the language models are able to generate text that is confident and eloquent yet entirely wrong. Jack Krawczyk, the product lead for Google’s Bard (now renamed to Gemini): “Bard and ChatGPT are large language models, not knowledge models. They are great at generating human-sounding text, they are not good at ensuring their text is fact-based. Why do we think the big first application should be Search, which at its heart is about finding true information?”</td>

People are prone to bias and prejudice. It’s a part of the human psyche. Human brains are limited and actively avoid learning to save energy. These same biases are likely to appear in LLM outputs as they are trained on human-produced content. Unless there is active work to try to counter and eliminate these biases from LLM output, they will appear frequently.</td>

# AI-fying User Interfaces (for Sustainability)

How can AI interfaces enable/help/encourage sustainability?

## Human Patterns

The fact that AI systems work so well is proof that we live in a
measurable world. The world is filled with structures: nature, cultures,
languages, human interactions - all form intricate patterns. Computer
systems are increasingly capable in their ability copy these patterns
into computer models - known as machine learning. As of 2023, 97
zettabytes (and growing) of data was created in the world per year
(Soundarya Jayaraman, 2023). Big data is a basic requirement for
training AIs, enabling learning from the structures of the world with
increasing accuracy. Representations of the real world in digital models
enable humans to ask questions about the real-world structures and to
manipulate them to create synthetic experiments that may match the real
world (if the model is accurate enough). This can be used for generating
human-sounding language and realistic images, finding mechanisms for
novel medicines as well as understanding the fundamental functioning of
life on its deep physical and chemical level (No Priors: AI, Machine
Learning, Tech, & Startups, 2023).

In essence, Human Patterns Enable AIs. Already ninety years ago
(McCulloch & Pitts, 1943) proposed the first mathematical model of a
neural network inspired by the human brain. Alan Turing’s Test for
Machine Intelligence followed in 1950. Turing’s initial idea was to
design a game of imitation to test human-computer interaction using text
messages between a human and 2 other participants, one of which was a
human, and the other - a computer. The question was, if the human was
simultaneously speaking to another human and a machine, could the
messages from the machine be clearly distinguished or would they
resemble a human being so much, that the person asking questions would
be deceived, unable to realize which one is the human and which one is
the machine? (Turing, 1950).

> Alan Turing: *“I believe that in about fifty years’ time it will be
> possible to program computers, with a storage capacity of about
> 10<sup>9</sup>, to make them play the imitation game so well that an
> average interrogator will not have more than 70 percent chance of
> making the right identification after five minutes of questioning. … I
> believe that at the end of the century the use of words and general
> educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able to
> speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted.”* -
> from (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 2021)

By the 2010s AI models became capable enough to beat humans in games of
Go and Chess, yet they did not yet pass the Turing test. AI use was
limited to specific tasks. While over the years, the field of AI had
seen a long process of incremental improvements, developing increasingly
advanced models of decision-making, it took an ***increase in computing
power*** and an approach called ***deep learning***, a variation of
***machine learning (1980s),*** largely modeled after the ***neural
networks*** of the biological (human) brain, returning to the idea of
***biomimicry***, inspired by nature, building a machine to resemble the
connections between neurons, but digitally, on layers much deeper than
attempted before.

“Generating structured data from unstructured inputs is one of the core
use cases for AI” Pokrass (2024)

### **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)**

Combining deep learning and reinforcement learning with human feedback
(RLHF) enabled to achieve levels of intelligence high enough to beat the
Turing test (Kara Manke, 2022; Christiano, 2021; Christiano et al.,
2017). OpenAI co-founder John Schulman describes RLHF simply: *“the
models are just trained to produce a single message that gets high
approval from a human reader”* (Kara Manke, 2022).

The nature-inspired approach was successful. Innovations such as
*back-propagation* for reducing errors through updating model weights
and *transformers* for tracking relationships in sequential data (for
example in sentences), enabled AI models to became increasingly capable
(Vaswani et al., 2017; Merritt, 2022). Generative Adversarial
Networks\*\*\* (GAN), (**ADD CITATION, 2016**), and ***Large Language
Models (*ADD CITATION*, 2018)***, enabled increasingly generalized
models, capable of more complex tasks, such as language generation. One
of the leading scientists in this field of research, Geoffrey Hinton,
had attempted back-propagation already in the 1980s and reminiscents how
*“the only reason neural networks didn’t work in the 1980s was because
we didn’t have have enough data and we didn’t have enough computing
power”* (CBS Mornings, 2023). (Epoch AI, 2024) reports the growth in
computing power and the evolution of more than 800 AI models since the
1950s. Very simply, more data and more computing power means more
intelligent models.

By the 2020s, AI-based models became a mainstay in medical research,
drug development, patient care (Leite et al., 2021; Holzinger et al.,
2023), quickly finding potential vaccine candidates during the COVID19
pandemic (Zafar & Ahamed, 2022), self-driving vehicles, including cars,
delivery robots, drones in the sea and air, as well as AI-based
assistants. The existence of AI models has wide implications for all
human activities from personal to professional. The founder of the
largest chimp-maker NVIDIA calls upon all countries do develop their own
AI-models which would encode their local knowledge, culture, and
language to make sure these are accurately captured (World Governments
Summit, 2024).

OpenAI has researched a wide range of approaches towards artificial
general intelligence (AGI), work which has led to advances in large
language models(Ilya Sutskever, 2018; AI Frontiers, 2018). In 2020
OpenAI released a LLM called GPT-3 trained on 570 GB of text (Alex
Tamkin & Deep Ganguli, 2021) which was adept in text-generation. (Singer
et al., 2022) describes how collecting billions of images with
descriptive data (for example the descriptive *alt* text which
accompanies images on websites) enabled researchers to train AI models
such as ***stable diffusion*** for image-generation based on
human-language. These training make use of ***Deep Learning***, a
layered approach to AI training, where increasing depth of the computer
model captures minute details of the world. Much is still to be
understood about how deep learning works; the fractal structure of deep
learning can only be called mysterious (Sohl-Dickstein, 2024).

### The Idiot Savant

Hinton likes to call AI an *idiot savant*: someone with exceptional
aptitude yet serious mental disorder (CBS Mornings, 2023). Large AI
models don’t understand the world like humans do. Their responses are
predictions based on their training data and complex statistics. Indeed,
the comparison is apt, as the AI field now offers jobs for *AI
psychologists (ADD CITATION)*, whose role is to figure out what exactly
is happening inside the ‘AI brain’. Understading the insides of AI
models trained of massive amounts of data is important because they are
*foundational*, enabling a holistic approach to learning, combining many
disciplines using languages, instead of the reductionist way we as human
think because of our limitations (CapInstitute, 2023).

Standford “thorough account of the opportunities and risks of foundation
models” (Bommasani et al., 2021).

Foundation models in turn enabled *generative AIs*, a class of models
which are able to generate many types of *tokens**,*** such as text,
speech, audio (San Roman et al., 2023; Kreuk et al., 2022), music (Copet
et al., 2023; Meta AI, 2023), video, and even complex structures such 3D
models and DNA structures, in any language it’s trained on. The advent
of generative AIs was a revolution in human-computer interaction as AI
models became increasingly capable of producing human-like content which
is hard to distinguish from actual human creations. This power comes
with *increased need for responsibility*, drawing growing interest in
fields like *AI ethics* and *AI explainability.* Generative has a
potential for misuse, as humans are increasingly confused by what is
computer-generated and what is human-created, unable to separate one
from the other with certainty.

The technological leap is great enough for people to start calling it a
start of a new era.(Noble et al., 2022) proposes AI has reached a stage
of development marking beginning of the *5th industrial revolution*, a
time of collaboration between humans and AI. Widespread Internet of
Things (IoT) sensor networks that gather data analyzed by AI algorithms,
integrates computing even deeper into the fabric of daily human
existence. Several terms of different origin but considerable overlap
describe this phenomenon, including *Pervasive Computing (PC)* (Rogers,
2022) and *Ubiquitous Computing*. Similar concepts are *Ambient
Computing*, which focuses more on the invisibility of technology, fading
into the background, without us, humans, even noticing it, and *Calm
Technology*, which highlights how technology respects humans and our
limited attention spans, and doesn’t call attention to itself. In all
cases, AI is integral part of our everyday life, inside everything and
everywhere. Today AI is not an academic concept but a mainstream
reality, affecting our daily lives everywhere, even when we don’t notice
it.

### **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)**

AI responses are probabilistic and need some function for ranking
response quality. Achieving higher percentage or correct responses
requires oversight which can come in the form of human feedback
(human-in-the-loop) - or by using other AIs systems which are deemed to
be already well-aligned (termed Constitutional AI by Anthropic) (Bailey,
2023; Bai et al., 2022). Less powerful AIs areFor example META used
LLAMA 2 for aligning LLAMA 3.

One approach to reduce the issues with AI is to introduce some function
for human feedback and oversight to automated systems. Human involvement
can take the form of interventions from the AI-developer themselves as
well as from the end-users of the AI system.

There are many examples of combination of AI and human, also known as
*“human-in-the-loop”,* used for fields as diverse as training computer
vision algorithms for self-driving cars and detection of disinformation
in social media posts (Wu et al., 2023; Bonet-Jover et al., 2023).

Also known as Human-based computation or human-aided artificial
intelligence (Shahaf & Amir, 2007; Mühlhoff, 2019)

### Algorithmic Experiences Before Non-Deterministic Systems

Even before AIs, as a user of social media, one may be accustomed to
interacting with the feed algorithms that provide a personalized
*algorithmic experience*. Algorithms are more deterministic than AI,
meaning they would produce more predictable output in comparison AI
models. Nonetheless, there are many reports about effects these
algorithms have on human psychology **(ADD CITATION)**. Design is
increasingly relevant to algorithms, and more specifically to algorithms
that affect user experience and user interfaces. ***When the design is
concerned with the ethical, environmental, socioeconomic,
resource-saving, and participatory aspects of human-machine interactions
and aims to affect technology in a more human direction, it can hope to
create an experience designed for sustainability.***

Lorenzo, Lorenzo & Lorenzo (2015) underlines the role of design beyond
*designing* as a tool for envisioning; in her words, *“design can set
agendas and not necessarily be in service, but be used to find ways to
explore our world and how we want it to be”*. Practitioners of
Participatory Design (PD) have for decades advocated for designers to
become more activist through ***action research***. This means to
influencing outcomes, not only being a passive observer of phenomena as
a researcher, or only focusing on usability as a designer, without
taking into account the wider context.

Shenoi (2018) argues inviting domain expertise into the discussion while
having a sustainable design process enables designers to design for
experiences where they are not a domain expert; this applies to highly
technical fields, such as medicine, education, governance, and in our
case here - finance and sustainability -, while building respectful
dialogue through participatory design. After many years of political
outcry (ADD CITATION), social media platforms such Facebook and Twitter
have begun to shed more light on how these algorithms work, in some
cases releasing the source code (Nick Clegg (2023); Twitter (2023)).

AI systems may make use of several algorithms within one larger model.
It follows that AI Explainability requires ***Algorithmic
Transparency**.*

The content on the platform can be more important than the interface.
Applications with a similar UI depend on the community as well as the
content and how the content is shown to the user.

### Transitioning to Complexity

AIs are non-deterministic, which requires a new set of consideration
when designing AI.

### Being Responsible, Explainable, and Safe

The problems of opaqueness creates the field of explainable AI.

*“As humans we tend to fear what we don’t understand”* is a common
sentiment which has been confirmed psychology (Allport, 1979). Current
AI-models are opaque ’*black boxes’*, where it’s difficult to pin-point
exactly why a certain decision was made or how a certain expression was
reached, not unlike inside the human brain. This line of thought leads
me to the idea of ***AI psychologists,*** who might figure out the
***thought patterns*** inside the model. Research in AI-explainability
(XAI in literature) is on the lookout for ways to create more
***transparency and credibility*** in AI systems, which could lead to
building trust in AI systems and would form the foundations for ***AI
acceptance***.

Red-teaming means pushing the limits of LLMs, trying to get them to
produce outputs that are racist, false, or otherwise unhelpful.

There’s an increasing number of tools for LLM evaluation:

-   “Evaluate and Track LLM Applications, Explainability for Neural
    Networks” (TruEra, 2023; Leino et al., 2018)

-   “evaluate your Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines,
    Metrics-Driven Development” Ragas (2023)

-   LangSmith “developer platform for every step of the LLM-powered
    application lifecycle, whether you’re building with LangChain or
    not. Debug, collaborate, test, and monitor your LLM applications.”
    LangChain (2024)

-   Tristan Greene (2022): when the quality of AI responses becomes good
    enough, people begin to get confused.

Bowman (2023) says steering Large Language Models is unreliable; even
experts don’t fully understand the inner workings of the models. Work
towards improving both ***AI steerability*** and ***AI alignment***
(doing what humans expect) is ongoing. Liang et al. (2022) believes
there’s early evidence it’s possible to assess the quality of LLM output
transparently. Cabitza et al. (2023) proposes a framework for quality
criteria and explainability of AI-expressions. Khosravi et al. (2022)
proposes a framework for AI explainability, focused squarely on
education. Holzinger et al. (2021) highlights possible approaches to
implementing transparency and explainability in AI models. While AI
outperforms humans on many tasks, humans are experts in multi-modal
thinking, bridging diverse fields.

-   Bigger models aren’t necessarily better; rather models need human
    feedback to improve the quality of responses Ouyang et al. (2022)

-   The user experience (UX) of AI is a topic under active development
    by all the largest online platforms. The general public is familiar
    with the most famous AI helpers, ChatGPT, Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s
    Alexa, Microsoft’s Cortana, Google’s Assistant, Alibaba’s Genie,
    Xiaomi’s Xiao Ai, and many others. For general, everyday tasks, such
    as asking factual questions, controlling home devices, playing
    media, making orders, and navigating the smart city.

-   Zhang et al. (2023) found humans are more likely to trust an AI
    teammate if they are not deceived by it’s identity. It’s better for
    collaboration to make it clear, one is talking to a machine. One
    step towards trust is the explainability of AI-systems.

Responsible AI Seeks to Mitigate Generative AIs’ Known Issues.

Given the widespread use of AI and its increasing power of foundational
models, it’s important these systems are created in a safe and
responsible manner. While there have been calls to pause the development
of large AI experiments (Future of Life Institute, 2023) so the world
could catch up, this is unlikely to happen. There are several problems
with the current generation of LLMs from OpenAI, Microsoft, Google,
Nvidia, and others.

approach to AI safety with the stated intention to provide clear
guidelines for the RLHF approach. OpenAI (2024c)

*AI acceptance* is incumbent on traits that are increasingly human-like
and would make a human be acceptable: credibility, trustworthiness,
reliability, dependability, integrity, character, etc.

### Mapping the Evolution of Models and their Emerging Abilities

The debate between Open Source v.s. Closed-Source AI is ongoing.
Historically open-source has been useful for finding bugs in code as
more pairs of eyes are looking at the code and someone may see a problem
the programmers have not noticed. Proponents of closed-source
development however worry about the dangers or releasing such powerful
technology openly and the possibility of bad actors such as terrorists,
hackers, violent governments using LLMs for malice. The question whether
closed-sourced or open-sourced development will be lead to more AI
safety is one of the large debates in the AI industry. In any case, open
or closed-sourced, real-world usage of LLMs may demonstrate the
limitations and edge-cases of AI. Hackathons such as (Pete, 2023) help
come up with new use-cases and disprove some potential ideas.

The proliferation of different models enables comparisons of performance

### Affective Computing Enables Human-Friendly Machines

Rosalind Picard is the founder of the *affective computing* field. Her
pioneering work aims to make computers more human-friendly. Because of
the conversational nature of LLMs, they are very useful for affective
computing, an approach to recognizing human emotions with machines and
providing users experiences that take human emotion into account
(Picard, 1997).

Just as LLMs, affective computing relies on input data. It’s not an
overstatement to say data from all the processes around us will define
the future of computing as HIITTV (2021b) puts it. In the early
examples, electrodermal activity of the skin and heart-rate variance
data were used to detect the emotional state and stress level of the
user (Zangróniz et al., 2017; Velmovitsky et al., 2022). This technology
has since become mainstream in products such as Fitbit and the Apple
Watch among many others.

Affective Design emerged from affective computing with a focus on
understanding user emotions to design UI/UX to which elicits specific
emotional responses (Reynolds, 2001).

Apple Watch features Fall Detection which I’ve experienced personally.
Riding my bicycle to the NCKU library I slipped and landed on my stomach
on the pavement. Watch immediately asked me: “It looks like you’ve taken
a hard fall” and offered an option to call the ambulance. Fortunately I
was OK but if I did need assistance, this AI algorithm delivered
contextual help which could save my health.

On the output side, Lv et al. (2022) studies the effect of
***cuteness*** of AI apps on users and found high perceived cuteness
correlated with higher willingness to use the apps, especially for
emotional tasks.

-   (Liu & Wei, 2021) suggests higher *algorithmic transparency may
    inhibit anthropomorphismI*; people are less likely to attribute
    humanness to an AI if they understand how the system works.
-   TEDx Talks (2011)
-   Lex Fridman (2019)
-   HIITTV (2021a)
-   BWH CNOC (2023)
-   Singularity University (2023)

Since the first mainframe computers with rudimentary computers able to
respond with text messages, humans have been drawn to discussing their
private lives with a machine that doesn’t judge you like a human could.
A famous anecdote is about the lab assistant of the Joseph Weizenbaum
MIT ELIZA project in the mid-1960s (1996), who would dedicate extended
time to talking to the machine in private. The machine was called DOCTOR
and emulated a Rogerian psychotherapist, person-centered therapy
developed by Carl Rogers, from the core idea that positive psychological
functioning is a inherently human motivation (Bassett, 2019; Rogers,
1995).

-   ELIZA is an early examples of a language model

Natural language generation exists since Eliza

### Conversations Are the Starting Point of a Relationship

High quality conversations are somewhat magical in that they can
establish trust and build rapport which humans.

(Celino & Re Calegari, 2020) found in testing chatbots for survey
interfaces that “\[c\]onversational survey lead to an improved response
data quality.”

Conversational AI

-   Bailey (2023) believes people are used to search engines and it will
    take a little bit time to get familiar with talking to a computer in
    natural language. NVIDIA founder Jensen Huang makes the idea
    exceedingly clear, saying *“Everyone is a programmer. Now, you just
    have to say something to the computer”* Leswing (2023).

There are noticeable differences in the quality of the LLM output, which
increases with model size. Levesque, Davis & Morgenstern (2012)
developed the *Winograd Schema Challenge*, looking to improve on the
Turing test, by requiring the AI to display an understanding of language
and context. The test consists of a story and a question, which has a
different meaning as the context changes: “The trophy would not fit in
the brown suitcase because it was too big” - what does the *it* refer
to? Humans are able to understand this from context while a computer
models would fail. Even GPT-3 still failed the test, but later LLMs have
been able to solve this test correctly (90% accuracy) Kocijan et al.
(2022). This is to say AI is in constant development and improving it’s
ability to make sense of language.

*ChatGPT* is the first *user interface (UI)* built on top of GPT-4 by
OpenAI and is able to communicate in a human-like way - using
first-person, making coherent sentences that sound plausible, and even -
confident and convincing. Wang (2023) ChatGPT reached 1 million users in
5 days and 6 months after launch has 230 million monthly active users.
While it was the first, competing offers from Google (Gemini),
Anthrophic (Claude), Meta (Llama) and others quickly followed starting a
race for best performance across specific tasks including standardized
tests from math to science to general knowledge and reasoning abilities.

OpenAI provides AI-as-a-service through its *application programming
interfaces (APIs),* allowing 3rd party developers to build custom UIs to
serve the specific needs of their customer. For example Snapchat has
created a *virtual friend* called “My AI” who lives inside the chat
section of the Snapchat app and helps people write faster with
predictive text completion and answering questions. The APIs make
state-of-the-art AI models easy to use without needing much technical
knowledge. Teams at AI-hackathons have produced interfaces for problems
as diverse as humanitarian crises communication, briefing generation,
code-completion, and many others. For instance, (Unleash, 2017) used BJ
Fogg’s *tiny habits model* to develop a sustainability-focused AI
assistant at the Danish hackathon series Unleash, to encourage
behavioral changes towards maintaining an aspirational lifestyle, nudged
by a chatbot buddy.

ChatGPT makes it possible to *evaluate AI models* just by talking,
i.e. having conversations with the machine and judging the output with
some sort of structured content analysis tools. Cahan & Treutlein (2023)
have conversations about science with AI. Pavlik (2023) and Brent A.
Anders (2022/2023) report on AI in education. (Kecht et al., 2023)\]
suggests AI is even capable of learning business processes.

### Multi-Modality: **Natural Interactions** Enhance the Humanity of Artificial Systems

Humans are multi-modal creatures by birth. To varied ability, we speak,
see, listen using our biological bodies. AIs are becoming multi-modal by
design to be able to match all the human modes of communication.

By early 2024, widely available LLMs front-ends such as Gemini, Claude
and ChatGPT have all released basic features for multi-modal
communication. In practice, this means combination several AI models
within the same interface. For example, on the input side, one model is
used for human speech or image recognition which are transcribed into
tokens that can be ingested into an LLM. On the output side, the LLM can
generate instructions which are fed into an image / audio generation
model or even computer code which can be ran on a virtual machine and
then the output displayed inside the conversation.

The quality of LLM output depends on the quality of the provided prompt.
Zhou et al. (2022) reports creating an “Automatic Prompt Engineer” which
automatically generates instructions that outperform the baseline output
quality by using another model in the AI pipeline in front of the LLM to
enhance the human input with language that is known to produce better
quality. This approach however is a moving target as foundational models
keep changing rapidly and the baseline might differ from today to 6
months later.

Multimodal model development is also ongoing. In the case of Google’s
Gemini 1.5 Pro, one model is able to handle several types of prompts
from text to images. Multimodal prompting however requires larger
context windows, as of writing, limited to 1 million tokens in a private
version allows combining text and images in the question directed to the
AI, used to reason in examples such as a 44-minute Buster Keaton silent
film or Apollo 11 launch transcript (404 pages) Google (2024).

Literature delves into human-AI interactions on almost human-like level
discussing what kind of roles can the AIs take. (Seeber et al., 2020)
proposes a future research agenda for regarding ***AI assistants as
teammates*** rather than just tools and the implications of such mindset
shift.

From Assistance to Collaboration

It’s not only what role the AI takes but how that affects the human. As
humans have ample experience relating to other humans and as such the
approach towards an assistants vs a teammate will vary. One researcher
in this field Karpus et al. (2021) is concerned with humans treating AI
badly and coins the term **“*algorithm exploitation”****.*

-   From assistant -\> teammate -\> companion -\> friend The best help
    for anxiety is a friend. AIs are able to assume different roles
    based on user requirements and usage context. This makes
    AI-generated content flexible and malleable.

Just as humans, AIs are continuously learning. Ramchurn, Stein &
Jennings (2021) discusses positive feedback loops in continually
learning AI systems which adapt to human needs.

*Context of Use,* Where is the AI used? (Schoonderwoerd et al., 2021)
focuses on human-centered design of AI-apps and multi-modal information
display. It’s important to understand the domain where the AI is
deployed in order to develop explanations. However, in the real world,
how feasible is it to have control over the domain? Calisto et al.
(2021) discusses **multi-modal AI-assistant** for breast cancer
classification.

### Multi-Modality: Speech Makes Computers Feel Real

Voice has a visceral effect on the human psyche; since birth we
recognize the voice of our mother. The voice of a loved one has a
special effect. Voice is a integral part of the human experience.
Machines that can use voice in an effective way are closer to
representing and affecting human emotions.

Voice assistants such as Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa are well-known
examples of AI technology in the world. Amazon’s Rohit Prasad thinks it
can do so much more, “Alexa is not just an AI assistant – it’s a trusted
advisor and a companion” (Prasad, 2022).

-   LLMs combined with voice provide a unnerving user experience Ethan
    Mollick \[@emollick\] (2023)
-   Ethical issues: Voice assistants need to continuously record human
    speech and process it in data centers in the cloud.
-   Siri, Cortana, Google Assistant, Alexa, Tencent Dingdang, Baidu
    Xiaodu, Alibaba AliGenie all rely on voice only.
-   Szczuka et al. (2022) provides guidelines for Voice AI and kids
-   Casper Kessels (2022a): “Guidelines for Designing an In-Car Voice

    Distraction?”
-   Tang et al. (2022) reports new findings enable computers to
    reconstruct language from fMRI readings. - Focus on voice education?

Some research suggests that voice UI accompanied by a *physical embodied
system* is the preffered by users in comparison with voice-only UI
(Celino & Re Calegari, 2020). This suggests adding an avatar to the AI
design may be worthwhile.

There’s evidence across disciplines about the usefulness of AI
assistants:

-   (Şerban & Todericiu, 2020) suggests using the Alexa AI assistant in
    *education* during the pandemic, supported students and teachers
    ‘human-like’ presence. Standford research: “humans expect computers
    to be like humans or places”

### **Generative UIs Enable Flexibility of Use**

Artificial intelligence user experience (AI UX)

The promise of *Generative User Interfaces* (GenUI) is to dynamically
provide an interface appropriate for the particular user and context.

The history of *intelligent interfaces* is long (Kobetz, 2023)

There’s wide literature available describing human-AI interactions

are diverse, some key lessons can be transferred horizontally across
fields of knowledge.

There are many ways to structure design theory. For the purposes of this
AI-focused research, I will begin from Generative UI.

structure: data-driven design, generative UI

AI is able to predict what kind of UI would the user need right now,
based on the data and context.

-   Replit, a startup known for allowing user build apps in the web
    browser, released Openv0, a framework of AI-generated UI components
    (Replit, 2023). *“Components are the foundation upon which user
    interfaces (UI) are built, and generative AI is unlocking component
    creation for front-end developers, transforming a once arduous
    process, and aiding them in swiftly transitioning from idea to
    working components.”*

-   Vercel introduced an open-source prototype UI-generator called V0
    which used large language models (LLMs) to create code for web pages
    based on text prompts (Vercel, 2023). Other similar tools quickly
    following including Galileo AI, Uizard AutoDesigner and Visily
    (Anon, 2024d).

-   In 2014, the eminent journal *Information Sciences* decided to
    dedicate a special section to AI-generated software to call
    attention to this tectonic shift in software development (Reformat,
    2014).

-   As machines become more capable, machines will eventually be capable
    of producing machines.

-   Generative UIs are largely invented in practice, based on user data
    analysis and experimentation, rather than being built in theory.
    Kelly Dern, a Senior Product Designer at Google lead a workshop in
    early 2024 on *GenUI for product inclusion* aiming to create
    ***“**more accessible and inclusive \[UIs for\] users of all
    backgrounds**”.***

-   (Anon, 2023c) gives an overview of the history of generative AI
    design tools going back in time until 2012 when (Troiano &
    Birtolo, 2014) proposed genetic algorithms for UI design.

-   (Fletcher, 2023) and (Joe Blair, 2024) are worried UIs are becoming
    average; that is more and more similar towards the lowest common
    denominator. We can generate better ones that are based on user data
    and would be truly personalized.

-   (Nielsen, 2024a) recounts how 30 years of work towards usability has
    largely failed - computers are still not accessible enough
    (***“difficult, slow, and unpleasant”***) - and has hope Generative
    UI could offer a chance to provide levels of accessibility humans
    could not.

-   (Matteo Sciortino, 2024) coins the phrase RTAG UIs *“real-time
    automatically-generated UI interfaces”* mainly drawing from the
    example of how his Netflix interface looks different from that of
    his sisters because of their dissimilar usage patterns.

-   (Anon, 2024b) Meanwhile is very critical because for the following
    reasons:

-   (Feifei Liu 刘菲菲, n.d.) ChatGPT is using buttons to explain
    context.

-   Nielsen (2024b) information scent from Information Foraging theory
    (Pirolli & Card, 1999).

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[5] }} />

What is the user interface of the green transformation?

-   Kate Moran & Sarah Gibbons (2024) “highly personalized, tailor-made
    interfaces that suit the needs of each individual” “Outcome-Oriented
    Design”

McKeough (2018) business consultancies have begun to recognize the
importance of design to business. They advise their corporate clients to
bring user experience design to the core of their business operations.

There’s a number of user interface design patterns that have provide
successful across a range of social media apps. Such *user experience /
user interface* (UX/UI) patterns are copied from one app to another, to
the extent that the largest apps share a similar look and feature set.
Common UX/UI parts include the Feed and Stories. By using common UI
parts from social media users have an easier time to accept the
innovative parts. add Viz charts. Avatars are increasingly common and
new generations are used to talking to computers.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[6] }} />

There are also more philosophical approaches to ***Interface Studies:***
David Hoang (2022), the head of product design at Webflow, suggests
taking cues from art studies to ***isolate the core problem***: *“An art
study is any action done with the intention of learning about the
subject you want to draw”*. As a former art student, Hoang looks at an
interface as *“a piece of design is an artwork with function”*.

Indeed, art can be a way to see new paths forward, practicing
“*fictioning*” to deal with problematic legacies: Anon (2023g)

### Artificial Empathy Also Builds Trust

Today’s machines are much more capable so it’s not a surprise humans
would like to talk to them. One example is ***AI Friend*** is Replika, a
computer model trained to be your companion in daily life. (Jiang, Zhang
& Pian, 2022) describes how Replika users in China using in 5 main ways,
all of which rely on empathy. The company’s CEO insists it’s not trying
to replace human relationship but to create an entirely new relationship
category with the AI companion; there’s value for the users in more
realistic avatars, integrating the experience further into users’ daily
lives through various activities and interactions (Patel, 2024).

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[7] }} />

-   Google is developing an AI assistant for giving life advice Goswami
    (2023).
-   GPT-4 is able to solve difficult task in chemistry with
    natural-language instructions White (2023)
-   Emojis are a part of natural language Tay (2023)

Jakob Nielsen notes two recent studies suggesting human deem
AI-generated responses more empathetic than human responses, at times by
a significant marring; however telling users the response is
AI-generated reduces the perceived empathy (Nielsen, 2024c; Ayers et
al., 2023; Yin, Jia & Wakslak, 2024)

### Interface: Usability is the Minimum of a Good User Experience

Usability sets the baseline but AI-interfaces are capable of more.

-   AI UX

-   Privacy UX Jarovsky (2022b)

-   AI UX dark patterns Jarovsky (2022a)

-   AI is usually a model that spits out a number between 0 and 1, a
    probability score or prediction. UX is what we do with this number.

-   Bailey (2023) believes people will increasingly use AI capabilities
    through UIs that are specific to a task rather than generalist
    interfaces like ChatGPT.

How do the tenets of user experience (UX) apply to AI?

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[9] }} />

Usability Guidelines

Microsoft Co-Founder predicted in 1982 *“personal agents that help us
get a variety of tasks”* (Bill Gates, 1982) and it was Microsoft that
introduced the first widely available personal assistant in 1996, called
Clippy, inside the Microsoft Word software. Clippy was among the first
assistants to reach mainstream adoption, helping users not yet
accustomed to working on a computer, to get their bearings (Tash
Keuneman, 2022). Nonetheless, it was in many ways useless and intrusive,
suggesting there was still little knowledge about UX and human-centered
design. Gates never wavered though and is quoted in 2004 saying *“If you
invent a breakthrough in artificial intelligence, so machines can learn,
that is worth 10 Microsofts”* Lohr (2004).

Gates updated his ideas in 2023 focuses on the idea of *AI Agents*
(Gates, 2023).

As late as in 2017, scientists were trying to create a program with
enough *natural-language understanding* to extract basic facts from
scientific papers Stockton (2017)

Might we try again?

With the advent of ChatGPT, the story of Clippy has new relevance as
part of the history of AI Assistants. Benjamin Cassidy (2022) and
Abigail Cain (2017) illustrate beautifully the story of Clippy and Tash
Keuneman (2022) ask poignantly: “We love to hate Clippy — but what if
Clippy was right?”

-   Life-like speaking faces from Microsoft Research turn a single image
    and voice clip into a life-like representation (Xu et al., 2024).

Many researchers have discussed the user experience (UX) of AI to
provide ***usability guidelines***.

Microsoft provides guidelines for Human-AI interaction (Li et al.
(2022); Amershi et al. (2019)) which provides useful heuristics
categorized by context and time.

AI is being use in high–Stakes Situations (Medical, Cars, Etc).

AI-based systems are being implemented in medicine, where stakes are
high raising the need for ethical considerations. Since CADUCEUS in the
1970s (in Kanza et al., 2021), the first automated medical decision
making system, medical AI now provides Health Diagnosic Symptoms and
AI-assistants in medical imaging. (Calisto et al., 2022) focuses on
AI-human interactions in medical workflows and underscores the
importance of output explainability. Medical professionals who were
given AI results with an explanation trusted the results more. (Lee,
Goldberg & Kohane, 2023) imagines an AI revolution in medicine using GPT
models, providing improved tools for decreasing the time and money spent
on administrative paperwork while providing a support system for
analyzing medical data.

    utilitarian and hedonic value are affected differently by social
    anxiety.”

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[11] }} />

### Interface: Human-Computer Interactions Without the “Computer”

AI Affects Human-Computer Interactions

The field of Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) emphasizes designing
user experiences (UX) that cater to human needs (The International
Ergonomics Association, 2019). Designers think through every interaction
of the user with a system and consider a set of metrics at each point of
interaction including the user’s context of use and emotional needs.

Software designers, unlike industrial designers, can’t physically alter
the ergonomics of a device, which should be optimized for human
well-being to begin with and form a cohesive experience together with
the software. However, software designers can significantly reduce
mental strain by crafting easy-to-use software and user-friendly user
journeys. Software interaction design goes beyond the form-factor and
accounts for human needs by using responsive design on the screen, aural
feedback cues in sound design, and even more crucially, by showing the
relevant content at the right time, making a profound difference to the
experience, keeping the user engaged and returning for more. In the
words of (Babich, 2019), ***“***\[T\]he moment of interaction is just a
part of the journey that a user goes through when they interact with a
product. User experience design accounts for all user-facing aspects of
a product or system”.

Drawing a parallel from narrative studies terminology, we can view user
interaction as a heroic journey of the user to achieve their goals, by
navigating through the interface until a success state - or facing
failure. Storytelling has its part in interface design however designing
for transparency is just as important, when we’re dealing with the
user’s finances and sustainability data, which need to be communicated
clearly and accurately, to build long-term trust in the service. For a
sustainable investment service, getting to a state of success - or
failure - may take years, and even longer. Given such long timeframes,
how can the app provide support to the user’s emotional and practical
needs throughout the journey?

(Tubik Studio, 2018) argues *affordance* measures the clarity of the
interface to take action in user experience design, rooted in human
visual perception, however, affected by knowledge of the world around
us. A famous example is the door handle - by way of acculturation, most
of us would immediately know how to use it - however, would that be the
case for someone who saw a door handle for the first time? A similar
situation is happening to the people born today. Think of all the
technologies they have not seen before - what will be the interface they
feel the most comfortable with?

For the vast majority of this study’s target audience (college
students), social media can be assumed as the primary interface through
which they experience daily life. The widespread availability of mobile
devices, cheap internet access, and AI-based optimizations for user
retention, implemented by social media companies, means this is the
baseline for young adult users’ expectations (as of writing in 2020).

(Shin, Zhong & Biocca, 2020) proposes the model (fig. 10) of Algorithmic
Experience (AX) ***“**investigating the nature and processes through
which users perceive and actualize the potential for algorithmic
affordance”* highlighting how interaction design is increasingly
becoming dependent on AI. The user interface might remain the same in
terms of architecture, but the content is improved, based on
personalization and understanding the user at a deeper level.

In 2020 (when I proposed this thesis topic), Google had recently
launched an improved natural language engine to better understand search
queries (Anon, 2019), which was considered the next step towards
*understanding* human language semantics. The trend was clear, and
different types of algorithms were already involved in many types of
interaction design, however, we were in the early stages of this
technology (and still are *early* in 2024). Today’s ChatGPT, Claude and
Gemini have no problem understanding human semantics - yet are they
intelligent?

Intelligence may be besides the point as long as AI *becomes very good
at reasoning*. AI is a *reasoning engine* (Shipper, 2023; Bubeck et al.,
2023; see Bailey, 2023 for a summary). That general observation applies
to voice recognition, voice generation, natural language parsing, among
others. Large consumer companies like McDonald’s are in the process of
replacing human staff with AI assistants in the drive-through, which can
do a better job in providing a personal service than human clerks, for
whom it would be impossible to remember the information of thousands of
clients. In (Barrett, 2019), in the words of *Easterbrook*, a previous
CEO of McDonald’s *“How do you transition from mass marketing to mass
personalization?”*

### Interface: Do AI-Agents Need Anthropomorphism

What are the next features that could improve the next-generation UX/UI
of AI-based assistants?

-   GPT 4o combines different abilities into the same model, preserving
    more information: (OpenAI, 2024b).

(Stone Skipper, 2022) sketches a vision of *“\[AI\] blend into our lives
in a form of apps and services”* deeply ingrained into daily human
activity.

Should AIs look anthropomorphic or fade in the background? It’s an open
question. Perhaps we can expect a mix of both depending on the context
of use and goals of the particular AI.

(Aschenbrenner, 2024) predicts “drop-in virtual coworkers”, AI-agents
who are able to use computer systems like a human seamlessly replacing
human employees.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[12] }} />

-   (Costa & Silva, 2022) “Interaction Design for AI Systems”

### Mediated Experiences Set User Expectations

How AIs are represented in popular media shapes the way we think about
AI companions. Some stories have AIs both in positive and negative
roles, such as Star Trek and Knight Rider. In some cases like Her and Ex
Machina, the characters may be complex and ambivalent rather than
fitting into a simple positive or negative box. In Isaac Asimov’s books,
the AIs (mostly in robot form) struggle with the 3 laws of robotics,
raising thought-provoking questions.

AI Assistants in Media Portrayals mostly have some level of
anthropomorphism through voice or image to be able to film; indeed, a
purely text-based representation may be too boring an un-cinematic.

There have been dozens of AI-characters in the movies, TV-series, games,
and (comic) books. In most cases, they have a physical presence or a
voice, so they could be visible for the viewers. Some include KITT
(Knight Industries Two Thousand).

### Roleplay Fits Computers Into Social Contexts

Should AIs be required to disclose they are AIs?

AI Friends and Roleplay (Anthropomorphic)

Calling a machine a friend is a proposal bound to turn heads. But if we
take a step back and think about how children have been playing with
toys since before we have records of history. It’s very common for
children to imagine stories and characters in play - it’s a way to
develop one’s imagination ***learn through roleplay***. A child might
have toys with human names and an imaginary friend and it all seems very
normal. Indeed, if a child doesn’t like to play with toys, we might
think something is wrong.

Likewise, inanimate objects with human form have had a role to play for
adults too. Anthropomorphic paddle dolls have been found from Egyptian
tombs dated 2000 years B.C. Anon (2023f): We don’t know if these dolls
were for religious purposes, for play, or for something else, yet their
burial with the body underlines their importance.

Coming back closer to our own time, Barbie dolls are popular since their
release in 1959 till today. Throughout the years, the doll would follow
changing social norms, but retain in human figure. In the 1990s, a
Tamagotchi is perhaps not a human-like friend but an animal-like friend,
who can interact in limited ways.

How are conversational AIs different from dolls? They can respond
coherently and perhaps that’s the issue - they are too much like humans
in their communication. We have crossed the ***Uncanny Valley*** (where
the computer-generated is nearly human and thus unsettling) to a place
where is really hard to tell a difference. And if that’s the case, are
we still playing?

Should the AI play a human, animal, or robot? Anthropomorphism can have
its drawbacks; humans have certain biases and preconceptions that can
affect human-computer interactions (Pilacinski et al., 2023) reports
humans were less likely to collaborate with red-eyed robots.

The AI startups like Inworld and Character.AI have raised large rounds
of funding to create characters, which can be plugged in into online
worlds, and more importantly, remember key facts about the player, such
as their likes and dislikes, to generate more natural-sounding dialogues
Wiggers (2023)

-   Lenharo (2023) experimental study reports AI productivity gains,
    DALL-E and ChatGPT are qualitatively better than former automation
    systems.

**Human-like**

Is anthropomorphism necessary? (Savings literature says it is)

As AIs became more expressive and able to to **roleplay**, we can begin
discussing some human-centric concepts and how people relate to other
people. AI companions, AI partners, AI assistants, AI trainers - there’s
are many **roles** for the automated systems that help humans in many
activities, powered by artificial intelligence models and algorithms.

-   RQ: Do college students prefer to talk to an Assistant, Friend,
    Companion, Coach, Trainer, or some other Role?

-   RQ: Are animal-like, human-like or machine-like AI companions more
    palatable to college students?

Humans (want to) see machines as human \[ADD CITATION\]

If we see the AI as being in human service. David Johnston (2023)
proposes ***Smart Agents***, “general purpose AI that acts according to
the goals of an individual human”. AI agents can enable ***Intention
Economy*** where one simply describes one’s needs and a complex
orchestration of services ensues, managed by the the AI, in order to
fulfill human needs Searls (2012). AI assistants provide help at scale
with little to no human intervention in a variety of fields from finance
to healthcare to logistics to customer support.

There is also the question of who takes responsibility for the actions
take by the AI agent. “Organization research suggests that acting
through human agents (i.e., the problem of indirect agency) can
undermine ethical forecasting such that actors believe they are acting
ethically, yet a) show less benevolence for the recipients of their
power, b) receive less blame for ethical lapses, and c) anticipate less
retribution for unethical behavior.” Gratch & Fast (2022)

-   Anthropomorphism literature Li & Sung (2021) “high-anthropomorphism
    (vs. low-anthropomorphism) condition, participants had more positive
    attitudes toward the AI assistant, and the effect was mediated by
    psychological distance. Though several studies have demonstrated the
    effect of anthropomorphism, few have probed the underlying mechanism
    of anthropomorphism thoroughly”

    chosen a few select examples in the table below.

**Animal-like: Some have an avatar, some not. I’ve created a framework
for categorization. Human-like or not… etc**

**Machine-like**

The Oxford Internet Institute defines AI simply as ***“computer
programming that learns and adapts”*** Google & The Oxford Internet
Institute (2022). Google started using AI in 2001, when a simple machine
learning model improved spelling mistakes while searching; now in 2023
most of Google’s products are are based on AI Google (2022). Throughout
Google’s services, AI is hidden and calls no attention itself. It’s
simply the complex system working behind the scenes to delivery a result
in a barebones interface.

````

Everything that existed before OpenAI’s GPT 4 has been blown out of the
water.

Pre-2023 literature is somewhat limited when it comes to AI companions
as the advantage of LLMs has significantly raised the bar for AI-advisor
abilities as well as user expectations.

Some evergreen advice most relates to human psychology which has
remained the same. (Haugeland et al., 2022) discusses ***hedonic user
experience*** in chatbots and (Steph Hay, 2017) explains the
relationship between emotions and financial AI.

-   Smaller startups have created digital companions such as Replika
    (fig. 8), which aims to become your friend, by asking probing
    questions, telling jokes, and learning about your personality and
    preferences - to generate more natural-sounding conversations.

### Roleplay Case: Financial Robo-Advisors

*Robo-advisors* is a fintech term that was in fashion largely before the
arrival of AI assistants and has been thus superseded by newer
technologies. Ideally, robo-advisors can be more dynamic than humans and
respond to changes to quickly and cheaply. Human advisors are very
expensive and not affordable for most consumers. (Capponi, Ólafsson &
Zariphopoulou, 2019) argues *“The client has a risk profile that varies
with time and to which the robo-advisor’s investment performance
criterion dynamically adapts”*. The key improvement of *personalized
financial advice* is understanding the user’s *dynamic risk profile*.

-   Newer literature notes robo-advisor related research is scattered
    across disciplines (Zhu, Vigren & Söderberg, 2024). –
    Athropomorphism: human-like attributes in robo-advisors, such as
    conversational chatbots, can affect adoption and risk preferences
    among customers. Studies show that anthropomorphized robo-advisors
    increase customer trust and reduce algorithm aversion.” **similar to
    my research**

In the early days in Europe, Germany and the United Kingdom led the way
with the most robo-advisory usage (Cowan, 2018). While Germany had 30+
robot-advisors on the market in 2019, with a total of 3.9 billion EUR
under robotic management, it was far less than individual apps like
Betterment managed in the US (Bankinghub, 2019). Already in 2017,
several of the early robo-advisors apps have shut down in the UK (AltFi,
2017). ETFmatic gained the largest number of downloads by 2017, focusing
exclusively on exchange-traded funds (ETFs), tracking stock-market
indexes automatically, with much less sophistication, than their US
counterparts (AltFi, 2017). The app was bought by a bank in 2021 and
closed down in 2023 (AltFi, 2021; Silva, 2023; Anon, 2023b).

Some relevant papers include a comparison of robot advisors by (Barbara
Friedberg, 2021) and (Slack, 2021)’s account of how before Generative
AI, financial chatbots were developed manually using a painstaking
process that was slow and error-prone, for example using the Atura
Process. Older financial robo-advisors, built by fintech companies
aiming to provide personalized suggestions for making investments such
as Betterment and Wealthfront are forced to upgrade their technology to
keep up.

The user interface and user experience (UI/UX) of consumer-focused
investing apps in Europe has improved a over the past decade. The
changing landscape is related to the earlier availability of better
quality apps available in the US and the disappearance of the 1st
generation of rudimentary investing apps and the lessons learned on how
to automate the delivery of financial services while increasing user
satisfaction.

In India, research is being conducted on how AI advisors could assist
with investors’ erratic behavior in stock market volatility situations,
albeit without much success (Bhatia, Chandani & Chhateja, 2020). India
had more than 2000 fintechs since 2015 (Migozzi, Urban & Wójcik, 2023).

-   Robo-advisors compete with community investing such as hedge funds,
    mutual funds, copy-trading, and DAOs with treasuries. Robo-Advisor
    do not have the type of social proof a community-based investment
    vehicle has. The question is, does the user trust the robot or a
    human.

-   While the financial AI companion apps in the US market are ahead
    globally, they are not yet using many of the user experience
    innovations that are prevalent on social media platforms targeted at
    Generation Z and/or Millennials, possibly presenting an opportunity
    for cross-industry knowledge transfer, from businesses that are
    traditionally closer to the consumer - such as retailers. Financial
    AI companion apps have not yet grown to mainstream scale in Asia,
    Africa, Latin America, and Europe, being for the moment a largely
    US-based retail investor trend. The apps outside of the US are niche
    products in a nascent stage, however, they still provide relevant
    design directions or stories of what to avoid.
