# Design for Sustainability {#design-for-sustainability}

***Designing for Sustainability*** encompasses all human activities, making this pursuit an over-arching challenge across all industries. Assuming that as individuals we want to act in a sustainable way, how exactly would be go about doing that?

-   IEA (2022) reports “Global CO2 emissions from energy combustion and industrial processes rebounded in 2021 to reach their highest ever annual level. A 6% increase from 2020 pushed emissions to 36.3 gigatonnes”
-   Crippa et al. (2022) reports latest figures from the EU’s Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR)
-   Growing public understanding of how nature works and intersects with our use of money.
-   The EU Copernicus satellite system reveals new greenhouse emissions previously undetected (Daniel Värjö (2022))

AI can help us make sense of the vast amounts of sustainability data generated daily.

-   Gupta et al. (2023) argues software is key to building more sustainable products, already for decades. More recently, companies like AutoDesk are putting CO2 calculations inside their design software. “Sustainability starts in the design process, and AI can help” “Sustainability Starts in the Design Process, and AI Can Help” (n.d.)

-   https://medium.com/ideas-at-igenius/lets-talk-about-sustainable-ai-d4ae4650493e

-   “Carbon pricing is not there to punish people.”

-   “It’s there to remind us, when we take travel, heating, consumption decisions that the true cost of fossil fuels comprises not only mining and processing, but also the damage done by the CO2 they release.”

-   Very simple.” Lion Hirth Lion Hirth (n.d.)

-   *EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities* (n.d.) report: The EU has a ***taxonomy of environmentally sustainable economic activities*** published by the Technical Expert Group (TEG) on sustainable finance .

-   Chapman (2009) argues in his seminal paper (and later in his book) for “Emotionally Durable Design”, the simple idea that we hold to things we value and thus they are sustainable. We don’t throw away a necklace gifted to us by mom, indeed this object might be passed down for centuries.

-   Rose (2015) has a similar idea, where “Enchanted Objects” become so interlinked with us, we’re unlikely to throw them away.

### Group Purchases {#group-purchases}

-   Buying in bulk for more savings.

### Designing for Health and Sustainability {#designing-for-health-and-sustainability}

-   Health and sustainability are intrinsically connected. Kjrgård et al. (2014) shows how *“By understanding health and sustainability as a duality, health both creates conditions and is conditioned by sustainability, understood as economic, social and environmental sustainability, while on the other hand sustainability creates and is conditioned by human health.”*

## Science in Design {#science-in-design}

## Quantified Self {#quantified-self}

There is a lot of research on quantified self. the Wearable devices like Apple Watch, Oura Ring and apps help users track a variety of health metrics. Can we also track personal sustainability in a similar fashion?

-   Delclòs-Alió et al. (2022) discusses walking in Latin American cities. Walkin is the most sustainable method or transport but requires the availability of city infrastructure, such as sidewalks, which many cities still lack.
-   Giannakos et al. (2020) used wearable devices to measured physiological parameters of students at school to determine their learning efficiency.
-   Shin et al. (2019)
-   Tsai et al. (2019)
-   Burger et al. (2019)
-   Aromatario et al. (2019) behavior changes

## Supply Chains {#supply-chains}

Several startups are using distributed ledgers (blockchains) to track source material to the factories ad product movements from factories to markets. While blockchains enable securely tracing data, which is immutable (no possible to change the same record, only update data in new records), the system still relies on correct data input. As the saying goes, “garbage in, garbage out”. Indeed, the blockchain is most useful for auditing, as the time and place of data input can be guaranteed, it will be easier to conduct a search on who inputted incorrect data.

The blockchain supply chain companies as of October 2022 include:

| №   | Company        | Link                       |

| 7   | Wabi           | https://wabi.io/           |

Another aspect of supply tracing is the treatment of workers and working conditions. Companies that intend to 2give supply chain a voice” by connecting workers directly to the consumer (even in anonymously, to protect the workers from retribution), include *CTMFile* and *Alexandria*.

### Interface Studies {#interface-studies}

-   David Hoang (2022), the head of product design at Webflow, suggests taking cues from art studies to ***isolate the core problem***. “An art study is any action done with the intention of learning about the subject you want to draw”. As a former art student, Hoang looks at an interface as *“a piece of design is an artwork with function”*.

### Speculative Design {#speculative-design}

-   Dunne & Raby (2013) invented the term *‘speculative design’* in their seminal book as the question on the intersection of user experience design and speculation. Speculative design makes use of future scenarios to envision contexts and interactions in future use. Phil Balagtas, founder of The Design Futures Initiative at McKinsey, discusses the value of building future scenarios at his talk at Google (Google Design, 2019). One of his examples, the Apple Knowledge Navigator, from an Apple vision video in 1987, took two decades to materialize in the real world, inspired by a similar device first shown in a 1970s episode of Star Trek as a magic device (a term from participatory design), which then inspired subsequent consumer product development - and then another 2 decades, until the launch of the iPhone in 2007 - a total of 40 years!

-   In my “green filter” AI advisor app’s scenario, the AI is scanning for opportunities matching the user’s sustainable investment appetite and risk profile, using different methods of analysis, including alternative data sources. Traditionally, financial analysts only looked at traditional data, such as company reports, government reports, historic performance, etc., for preparing advisory guidance to their clients. With the advent of AI and big data analysis, many other options of research data have become available, for example, accurate weather predictions for agriculture can affect guidance, because of expected future weather disasters in the area. Other examples include policy predictions, pollution metrics, etc.

-   Professional financial advisors use automated tools to analyze data and present it in human form to clients. Today’s ubiquitous mobile interfaces, however, provide the opportunity to ‘cut out the middleman’ and provide similar information to clients directly, at a lower cost and a wider scale, often without human intervention. Additional (more expensive) “human-judgment- as-a-service”, a combination of robots + human input, can help provide further personalized advice for the consumer, still at a cheaper price than a dedicated human advisor. Everyone can have a financial advisor.

### “Speculative Design” for a sustainability assistant {#speculative-design-for-a-sustainability-assistant}

-   Barendregt & Vaage (2021) explores the potential of speculative design to stimulate public engagement through thought experiments that spur public debate on an issue chosen by the designer.
-   Google Design (2019)
-   All green categories — Green hub — Ask the user to prioritize

### Experience Design {#experience-design}

-   In @michaelabrashInventingFuture2017 Meta Oculus AR Incubation GM Laura Fryer: “People buy experiences, not technology.”
-   Loaning terminology from service design, the user journey within an app needs to consider about touchpoint on the way to a state of success.

### Mobile App Design {#mobile-app-design}

There’s a number of user interface design patterns that have provide successful across a range of social media apps, copied from one to another, to the extent that the largest social media apps share a similar look and feature set.

-   Mobile-first

-   Provides a community for pooling money with like-minded investors

-   Social

-   Educational

-   Edutainment

-   Fun

-   Stories section like IG / app store

-   Common UI parts. Feed. Stories.  By using common UI parts from social media users have an easier time to accept the innovative parts. add Viz charts. Avatars are increasingly common and new generations are used to talking to computers.

-   Karina from Korea (aespa (2020)). It makes sense your sustainability assistant would talk to you. Studies show gen N is speaking to computers all the time. Interacting with the user is on the rise. For example, Chime makes tipping suggestions on the place of purchase.

### The Concept of ‘Nudge’ {#the-concept-of-nudge}

-   The literature on *nudge* is wide, as researches try to find ways to affect human behaviors towards sustainability. Some notable examples: - Eriksson et al. (2023) - Acuti et al. (2023) - Perez-Cueto (2021) - Wee et al. (2021) - Guath et al. (2022) - Berger et al. (2022)
-   Google and X have offered the “Green Filter” on Maps, Flights, etc. What if there was a “Green Filter” on every product everywhere?

``` mdx-code-block
<Figure caption="Google's view of flight emissions" src={FlightEmissions} refURL="https://www.google.com/travel/flights" refTitle="Copyright by Google 2023 referenced under fair use" />
```

-   One example of *nudge* are the small UI updates released by Google across its portfolio of products: Google Flights and Google maps. Google’s research introduces the concept of *digital decarbonization*, defined as “Maximising the enabling role of digital technologies by accelerating already available digital solutions” (Implement Consulting Group (2022)). Google’s Chief Sustainability Officer Kate Brandt suggests “Digital solutions play an important enabling role for at least 20-25% of the reductions required to achieve a net-zero economy in Europe” (Kate Brandt & Matt Brittin (2022)).

| №   | Product        | Nudge                                |
|-----|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1   | Google Maps    | Show routes with lower CO2 emissions |
| 2   | Google Flights | Show CO2 emissions                   |

-   Becoming a Sustainability-Aware App or Game. Jeni Miles (2022) suggests “Google recently shared its goal to help one billion people make more sustainable choices by embedding carbon emissions information into Google Flights and surfacing whether a hotel is Green Key or EarthCheck certified.”

-   I’m interested in the concept of a “social object” https://medium.com/we-research-and-expriment-with-how-the-sharing/what-is-a-social-object-8dd52df0f15c

-   How the design can connect people to sustainable outcomes while shopping and investing? Perhaps even forming a community of sustainable action. What I showed in class looks like an app but it could also be a physical object (a speculative design). From the presentations I saw most students seemed to be interested in form and light (many lamps) and a couple were about medical uses. I don’t remember seeing one that could be compatible with the environmental sustainability focus unfortunately…

### Sustainability Superapp {#sustainability-superapp}

-   How to design superapps? Lots of options in a single app.

-   https://sifted.eu/articles/europe-superapp-revolut-klarna/

-   WeChat

-   Adaptive AI

-   Vecchi & Brennan (2022) China is the home of many superapps and this paper discusses the strategies taken to expand to other markets.

-   Shabrina Nurqamarani et al. (2020) discusses the system consistency and quality of South–East Asian superapps Gojek and Grab.

-   Zeng (2015) **(need to pay for article!)**

-   Huang & Miao (2021) **(need to pay for article!)**

-   Suarez et al. (2021) suggests using alternative data from super-apps to estimate user income levels, including 4 types of data: Personal Information, Consumption Patterns, Payment Information, and Financial services. Roa et al. (2021) finds super-app alternative data is especially useful for credit-scoring young, low-wealth individuals.

-   Giudice (2020) MA thesis’s argues WeChat has had a profound impact on changing China into a cashless society, underlining how one mobile app can transform social and financial interactions of an entire country.
