## Young Adults {#young-adults}

-   Is getting people to go to nature more a good way to increase
    ecological awareness?

### Climate Anxiety {#climate-anxiety}

Design to reduce climate anxiety

-   @thompsonYoungPeopleClimate2021 Young people have climate anxiety.
-   @hickmanClimateAnxietyChildren2021 anxious kids
-   Designing for Health and Sustainability: Health and sustainability
    are intrinsically connected. @kjaergardHealthSustainability2014
    shows how *“By understanding health and sustainability as a duality,
    health both creates conditions and is conditioned by sustainability,
    understood as economic, social and environmental sustainability,
    while on the other hand sustainability creates and is conditioned by
    human health.”*
-   @whitmarshClimateAnxietyWhat2022 shows how climate anxiety is more
    prevalent among young people and is a possible motivator for climate
    action.
-   @ogunbodeClimateAnxietyWellbeing2022 finds climate anxiety in 32
    countries and also supports the idea that climate anxiety leads to
    climate activism.
-   Finds that climate anxiety predicts joining climate action movements
-   How to support the youth?
-   Design for Human Rights
    @unfcccconferenceofthepartiesservingasthemeetingofthepartiestotheparisagreementcmaSharmElSheikhImplementation2022
    text refers to “human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable
    environment”.

### What is Product Design? {#what-is-product-design}

Young people expect a product.

-   @koningsHowPrepareYour2020
-   “Digital sustainability principles”

### Empowering Design {#empowering-design}

-   @rossClimateChangeChallenge2016a says most people in the US don’t
    act on climate change. “Action on climate change has been
    compromised by uncertainty, aspects of human psychology”.

-   @RooneyVargaClimateActionSimulation2019 shows the effectiveness of
    ***The Climate Action Simulation*** in educating users about success
    scenarios.

-   Younger people show higher motivation (participants in climate
    protests). How to be relevant for a younger audience?

-   Yet action remains low.

-   @openseaTopTaiwanInfluencers2022 Taiwanese digital influencers as
    NFTs.

-   *For young people, investing mostly means buying cryptocurrencies?*

### What is Interaction Design? {#what-is-interaction-design}

-   @kolkoThoughtsInteractionDesign2010; @ixdfWhatInteractionDesign
    believes interaction design is still an emerging (and changing)
    field and there are many definitions. I prefer the simplest version:
    interaction design is about creating a conversation between the
    product and the user.
-   @weinschenk100ThingsEvery2011 says “People expect most online
    interactions to follow the same social rules as person-to-person
    interactions. It’s a shortcut that your brain uses to quickly
    evaluate trustworthiness.”
-   @richardyangInteractionDesignMore2021 and
    @justinbakerRedRoutesCritical2018 say some of the tools used by
    interaction designers include
-   Red Route Analysis
-   AI for design: @AINextChapter2023
-   Science in Design
    https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ScienceinDesign&src=hashtag_click

### Personas {#personas}

-   Use personas to articulate assumptions

-   Persona: I care mostly about… fashion, art, …

-   @dontlookupMethodology Don’t look up five user models / roles
    Consumer, Investor, Activist, ..

### Experience Design {#experience-design}

-   In @michaelabrashInventingFuture2017 Meta Oculus AR Incubation GM
    Laura Fryer: “People buy experiences, not technology.”
-   Loaning terminology from service design, the user journey within an
    app needs to consider about touchpoint on the way to a state of
    success.

### Storytelling and Narrative Design {#storytelling-and-narrative-design}

Bring together film school experience with design… Does branding also go
here?

| Company        | Link                       |
|----------------|----------------------------|
| Ocean Protocol | https://oceanprotocol.com/ |

-   Older research on young adults by @katemoranDesigningYoungAdults2016
    (Millenials at the time) highlights how Millenials “use Google as a
    reference point for ease of use and simplicity”.

-   The rising availability of AI assistants however may displace Google
    search with a more conversational UX. Indeed, Google itself is
    working on smarter tools to displace their own main product, as
    exemplified by Google Assistant and large investments into LLMs.

### Stickyness {#stickyness}

-   Low attrition of the product?

### Guided Sustainability {#guided-sustainability}

-   Sustainability touches every facet of human existence and is thus an
    enormous undertaking. Making progress on sustainability is only
    possible if there’s a large-scale coordinated effort by humans
    around the planet. For this to happen, some technological tools are
    required.
-   List of metrics that should be tracked to enable useful analytics.
    Ex: % of beach pollution, air pollution, water pollution (I had this
    idea while meditating). IIn essence, “green filter” is a central
    data repository not unlike “Apple Health for Sustainability”.
-   Health and fitness category apps
-   Using “green filter” you can get a personalized sustainability plan
    and personal coach to become healthy and nature-friendly
-   There are many examples of combination of AI and human, also known
    as “human-in-the-loop”. For example health apps like Welltory,
    Wellue and QALY. Food delivery apps like Starship Robots who ask for
    human help when crossing the road.
-   How would you rate your knowledge on sustainability?
-   How would you rate your ability to put sustainability into practice?
-   “Guided Sustainability refers to a concept of using technology, such
    as AI and machine learning, to help individuals and organizations
    make more sustainable decisions and take actions that promote
    environmental and social sustainability. This can include things
    like analyzing data on resource usage and emissions, providing
    recommendations for reducing the environmental impact of operations,
    or helping to identify and track progress towards sustainability
    goals. The goal of guided sustainability is to make it easier for
    people to understand their impact on the environment and to take
    steps to reduce that impact.”

### Interface Studies {#interface-studies}

-   @davidhoangCreatingInterfaceStudies2022, the head of product design
    at Webflow, suggests taking cues from art studies to ***isolate the
    core problem***. “An art study is any action done with the intention
    of learning about the subject you want to draw”. As a former art
    student, Hoang looks at an interface as *“a piece of design is an
    artwork with function”*.

### Speculative Design {#speculative-design}

-   @dunneSpeculativeEverythingDesign2013 invented the term
    *‘speculative design’* in their seminal book as the question on the
    intersection of user experience design and speculation. Speculative
    design makes use of future scenarios to envision contexts and
    interactions in future use. Phil Balagtas, founder of The Design
    Futures Initiative at McKinsey, discusses the value of building
    future scenarios at his talk at Google (Google Design, 2019). One of
    his examples, the Apple Knowledge Navigator, from an Apple vision
    video in 1987, took two decades to materialize in the real world,
    inspired by a similar device first shown in a 1970s episode of Star
    Trek as a magic device (a term from participatory design), which
    then inspired subsequent consumer product development - and then
    another 2 decades, until the launch of the iPhone in 2007 - a total
    of 40 years!

-   In my “green filter” AI advisor app’s scenario, the AI is scanning
    for opportunities matching the user’s sustainable investment
    appetite and risk profile, using different methods of analysis,
    including alternative data sources. Traditionally, financial
    analysts only looked at traditional data, such as company reports,
    government reports, historic performance, etc., for preparing
    advisory guidance to their clients. With the advent of AI and big
    data analysis, many other options of research data have become
    available, for example, accurate weather predictions for agriculture
    can affect guidance, because of expected future weather disasters in
    the area. Other examples include policy predictions, pollution
    metrics, etc.

-   Professional financial advisors use automated tools to analyze data
    and present it in human form to clients. Today’s ubiquitous mobile
    interfaces, however, provide the opportunity to ‘cut out the
    middleman’ and provide similar information to clients directly, at a
    lower cost and a wider scale, often without human intervention.
    Additional (more expensive) “human-judgment- as-a-service”, a
    combination of robots + human input, can help provide further
    personalized advice for the consumer, still at a cheaper price than
    a dedicated human advisor. Everyone can have a financial advisor.

### Design Studies {#design-studies}

-   Eminent journal Design Studies, 1st design journal

-   @ceschinEvolutionDesignSustainability2016 shows how design for
    sustainability has expanded from a product focus to systems-thinking
    focus placing the product inside a societal context of use.

### Mobile App Design {#mobile-app-design}

Young people are mobile-first.

There’s a number of user interface design patterns that have provide
successful across a range of social media apps, copied from one to
another, to the extent that the largest social media apps share a
similar look and feature set.

-   Mobile-first

-   Provides a community for pooling money with like-minded investors

-   Social

-   Educational

-   Edutainment

-   Fun

-   Stories section like IG / app store

-   Common UI parts. Feed. Stories.  By using common UI parts from
    social media users have an easier time to accept the innovative
    parts. add Viz charts. Avatars are increasingly common and new
    generations are used to talking to computers.

-   @aespaAespaEseupaMY2020: Karina from Korea. It makes sense your
    sustainability assistant would talk to you. Studies show gen N is
    speaking to computers all the time. Interacting with the user is on
    the rise. For example, Chime makes tipping suggestions on the place
    of purchase.

### Community {#community}

### Community’s Role in Design {#communitys-role-in-design}

-   Psychology of ‘fundraising clubs’ vs individual investing

-   @UkraineDAOBiddingUkrainian Ukraine DAO

-   POAPs:

### Group Purchases {#group-purchases}

Food ordering apps are popular.

-   Buying in bulk for more savings.

-   Through group purchases and community investing while also reducing
    consumption.

-   People want to help and make a difference. Give people things to do.

-   Choose Your Climate Solutions

-   Find Your Composting Community

-   Monoculture -\> regenerative food forests Oil -\> electric cars /
    bicycles

### Data-Driven Design {#data-driven-design}

-   Rebuilt the app as a personalized, narrative lifestyle feed

**Question: What does investing mean for you? NFTs, Crypto,** Stocks,
Real-estate? If you have 1000 EUR, what will you buy?

-   “Any community on the internet should be able to come together, with
    capital, and work towards any shared vision. That starts with
    empowering creators and artists to create and own the culture
    they’re creating. In the long term this moves to internet
    communities taking on societal endeavors.”

-   @joshluberTradingCardsAre2021 Trading cards are cool again

-   @jesseeinhornNewBalance6502020

-   @connieloizosMarcyVenturePartners2021

-   @natashamascarenhasQueenlyMarketplaceFormalwear2021

-   @jeffjohnrobertsDigitalArtAwaits2020

### Social Objects {#social-objects}

-   @sharing.labWhatSocialObject2015: I’m interested in the concept of a
    “social object”.

-   How the design can connect people to sustainable outcomes while
    shopping and investing? Perhaps even forming a community of
    sustainable action. What I showed in class looks like an app but it
    could also be a physical object (a speculative design). From the
    presentations I saw most students seemed to be interested in form
    and light (many lamps) and a couple were about medical uses. I don’t
    remember seeing one that could be compatible with the environmental
    sustainability focus unfortunately…

-   What percent of all design is “sustainable design” ? Promoting
    sustainable design.

### Fast Fashion {#fast-fashion}

@YoungConsumersComplicated: Young people are the largest consumers of
fast fashion.

Across industries, reports are saying there isn’t enough transparency.

Sustainable Fashion, Textile Design

-   In @europeanenvironmentagencyTextilesEnvironmentRole2022, European
    Environment Agency (EEA) estimates based on trade and production
    data that EU27 citizens consumed an average 15kg of textile products
    per person per year. @kohlerCircularEconomyPerspectives2021:
    Globally 87% of textile products are burned or landfilled after 1st
    consumer use.

-   @marrucciImprovingCarbonFootprint2020 Italian retail supermarkets
    carbon footprint?

-   @leungGreenDesign2021 There’s a growing know-how on how to produce
    sustainably and which materials to use. “Handbook of Footwear Design
    and Manufacture” Chapter 18 - Green design.

-   @emilychanWill2022Be2022 New Standard Institute’s proposed “Fashion
    Act” to require brands doing business in New York City to disclose
    sustainability data and set waste reduction targets.

-   @wikirateSharingDataCreating2022: “Among the Index’s main goals are
    to help different stakeholders to better understand what data and
    information is being disclosed by the world’s largest fashion brands
    and retailers, raise public awareness, educate citizens about the
    social and environmental challenges facing the global fashion
    industry and support people’s activism.”

-   @millward-hopkinsMaterialFlowAnalysis2023 shows how half of the
    textile waste in the UK is exported to other countries.

-   @mabuzaNaturalSyntheticDyes2023 shows consumer knowledge of apparel
    coloration is very limited.

-   @gyabaahCharacterizationDumpsiteWaste2023 research across several
    dumpsites across Ghana revealed up to 12% of the landfill consisted
    of textile waste.

-   @yapLifeCycleAssessment2023 Singapore disposes of 900,000 tonnes of
    plastic waste out of which only 4% is recycled.

### Quantified Self {#quantified-self}

There is a lot of research on quantified self. the Wearable devices like
Apple Watch, Oura Ring and apps help users track a variety of health
metrics. Can we also track personal sustainability in a similar fashion?

-   @delclos-alioWalkingTransportationLarge2022 discusses walking in
    Latin American cities. Walkin is the most sustainable method or
    transport but requires the availability of city infrastructure, such
    as sidewalks, which many cities still lack.

## Circular Design {#circular-design}

-   @circleeconomyCircularityGapReport2022 reports only 8.6% of world
    economy is circular and *100B tonnes of virgin materials* are
    sourced every year.
-   There’s a growing number of companies providing re-use of existing
    items.
-   @SmartSwap For example, Swap furniture in Estonia

### Design for Repair {#design-for-repair}

-   @pastorProposingIntegratedIndicator2023 proposes a **product
    repairability index (PRI)**
-   @formentiniDesignCircularDisassembly2023

### Platform Economy {#platform-economy}

-   Network Effects: The more people use a platform, the more valuable
    it becomes.

-   The most successful businesses today (as measured in terms of the
    number of users) look at the whole user experience. Popular consumer
    platforms strive to design solutions that feel personalized at every
    touchpoint on the user journey (to use the language of service
    design) but doing so at the scale of hundreds of millions (or even
    billions) of users - personalization at scale.

-   The rise of the platform economy has given us marketplace companies
    like Airbnb and Uber that match idle resources with retail demand
    and optimize how our cities work. The massive amounts of data
    generated by these companies are used by smart cities to re-design
    their physical environments. With this perspective of scale, what
    would a shopping experience look like if one knew at the point of
    sale, which products are greener, and which are more environmentally
    polluting?

-   What would a sustainable investment platform that matches green
    investments with the consumers look like, if one saw the
    side-by-side comparison of investment vehicles on their ESG
    performance?

### Factories {#factories}

### Extended Producer Responsibility {#extended-producer-responsibility}

-   @steenmansFosteringCircularEconomy2023 Argues for the need to engage
    companies through legislation and shift from waste-centered laws to
    product design regulations.

-   @pengExtendedProducerResponsibility2023 finds that the Carbon
    Disclosure Project has been a crucial tool to empower ERP in Chinese
    auto-producers.

-   @liuGlobalPerspectiveEwaste2023 reports, e–waste is growing 3%–5%
    every year, globally. @thukralExploratoryStudyProducer2023
    identifies several barriers to e-waste management among producers
    including lack of awareness and infrastructure, attitudinal
    barriers, existing *informal* e-waste sector, and the need for an
    e-waste license.

-   In Europe, there’s large variance between member states when in
    comes to textile recycling: while Estonia and France are the only EU
    countries where separate collection of textiles is required by law,
    in Estonia 100% of the textiles were burned in an incinerator in
    2018 while in France textiles are covered by an Extended Producer
    Responsibility (EPR) scheme leading to higher recovery rates (Ibid).

-   @christiansenExtendedProducerResponsibility2021: Nonetheless, EPR
    schemes do not guarantee circularity and may instead be designed
    around fees to finance waste management in linear economy models.

-   @jacquesvernierExtendedProducerResponsibility2021: French EPR scheme
    was upgraded in 2020 to become more circular.

-   In any case, strong consumer legislation (such as EPR) has a direct
    influence on producers’ actions. For example, in
    @hktdcresearchFranceExpandsProducer2022@, the Hong Kong Trade
    Development Council notified textile producers in July 2022
    reminding factories to produce to French standards in order to be
    able enter the EU market.

***Design implications:** ERP and CDP data should be part of Green
Filter.*

### Food Waste {#food-waste}

-   @nabipourafrouziComprehensiveReviewCarbon2023: “The agricultural
    sector contributes to approximately 13.5% of the total global
    anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and accounts for 25% of the
    total CO2 emission.”

There are several initiatives to reduce food waste by helping people
consume food that would otherwise be throw away.

-   @pooreReducingFoodEnvironmental2018 suggests 26% of carbon emissions
    come from food production. @FoodPrints2015 reports dairy (46%) and
    meat and fish (29%) products making up the largest GHG emission
    potential. @springmannGlobalRegionalCosts2021 proposes veganism is
    the most effective decision to reduce personal CO2 emissions.

-   Food Sovereignty: “The global food sovereignty movement, which had
    been building momentum since its grassroots conception in the late
    ’90s, quickly gained traction with its focus on the rights of people
    everywhere to access healthy and sustainable food. One of the
    pillars of the movement lies in using local food systems to reduce
    the distance between producers and consumers.”

-   @caitlinstall-paquetFreshCityRise2021: “We can grow foods just as
    well in the inner city as we can out in the country because we’re

### Blockchain Supply Chains {#blockchain-supply-chains}

-   Several startups are using distributed ledgers (blockchains) to
    track source material to the factories ad product movements from
    factories to markets. While blockchains enable securely tracing
    data, which is immutable (no possible to change the same record,
    only update data in new records), the system still relies on correct
    data input. As the saying goes, “garbage in, garbage out”. Indeed,
    the blockchain is most useful for auditing, as the time and place of
    data input can be guaranteed, it will be easier to conduct a search
    on who inputted incorrect data.

-   The blockchain supply chain companies as of summer 2023 include:

| Company        | Link                       |
|----------------|----------------------------|
| Ocean Protocol | https://oceanprotocol.com/ |
| Provenance     | https://www.provenance.io/ |
| Ambrosius      | https://ambrosus.io/       |
| Modum          | https://www.modum.io/      |

| FairFood       | https://fairfood.org/      |
| Bext360        | https://www.bext360.com/   |

-   Another aspect of supply tracing is the treatment of workers and
    working conditions. Companies that intend to 2give supply chain a
    voice” by connecting workers directly to the consumer (even in
    anonymously, to protect the workers from retribution), include
    *CTMFile* and *Alexandria*.

### Carbon Labelling {#carbon-labelling}

-   @adamcornerWhyWeNeed2012: Adding CO2 labels for consumer products
    have been discussed for decades.
-   While academic literature has looked at even minute detail such as
    color and positioning of the label (@zhouCarbonLabelsHorizontal2019)
    and there is some indication consumers are willing to pay a small
    premium for low-CO2 products (@xuLowcarbonEconomyCarbon2022) as well
    as all else being equal, choose the option with a lower CO2 number
    (@carlssonSustainableFoodCan2022), the idea of *Carbon Labelling* is
    yet to find mainstream adoption.
-   Although there’s some evidence to suggest labeling low CO2 food
    enables people to choose a *climatarian diet* in a large-scale study
    @lohmannCarbonFootprintLabels2022 of UK university students, their
    impact on the market share of low-carbon meals is negible.
-   @asioliConsumersValuationCultured2022 found differences between
    countries, where Spanish and British consumers chose meat products
    with *‘No antibiotics ever’* over a *Carbon Trust* label, whereas
    French consumers chose CO2 labeled meat products.
-   Labels alone are not enough, as underlined by
    @edenbrandtConsumerPerceptionsAttitudes2022 in Sweden in a study
    which found a negative correlation between worrying about climate
    impact and interest in climate information on products, suggesting a
    need for wider environmental education programs.

### The Concept of ‘Nudge’ {#the-concept-of-nudge}

-   The literature on *nudge* is wide, as researches try to find ways to
    affect human behaviors towards sustainability. Some notable
    examples:
-   @WEE2021100364 proposes 7 types of nudging technique based on an
    overview of 37 papers in the field.

| Name              | Technique                                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Prompting         | Create cues and reminders to perform a certain behavior                                   |
| Sizing            | Decrease or increase the size of items or portions                                        |
| Proximity         | Change the physical (or temporal) distance of options                                     |
| Presentation      | Change the way items are displayed                                                        |
| Priming           | Expose users to certain stimuli before decision-making                                    |
| Labelling         | Provide labels to influence choice (for example CO2 footprint labels)                     |
| Functional Design | Design the environment and choice architecture so the desired behavior is more convenient |

-   @ERIKSSON2023229 discusses best practices for reducing food waste in
    Sweden.
-   @ACUTI2023122151 makes the point that physical proximity to a
    drop-off point helps people participate in sustainability.
-   A small study (n = 33) @perez-cuetoNudgingPlantbasedMeals2021 in the
    Future Consumer Lab in Copenhagen found that designing a
    “dish-of-the-day” which was prominently displayed helped to increase
    vegetarian food choice by 85%.
-   @GUATH2022101821 experiments (n=200) suggested nudging can be
    effective in influencing online shopping behavior towards more
    sustainable options.
-   @BERGER2022134716 **(Need access!)**
-   Google and X have offered the “Green Filter” on Maps, Flights, etc.
    What if there was a “Green Filter” on every product everywhere?

```mdx-code-block
<Figure caption="Google's view of flight emissions" src={FlightEmissions} refURL="https://www.google.com/travel/flights" refTitle="Copyright by Google 2023 referenced under fair use" />
```

-   One example of *nudge* are the small UI updates released by Google
    across its portfolio of products: Google Flights and Google maps.
    Google’s research introduces the concept of *digital
    decarbonization*, which
    @implementconsultinggroupHowDigitalSector2022 defines as “Maximising
    the enabling role of digital technologies by accelerating already
    available digital solutions”.
-   In @katebrandtGoogleClimateAction2022, Google’s Chief Sustainability
    Officer Kate Brandt suggests “Digital solutions play an important
    enabling role for at least 20-25% of the reductions required to
    achieve a net-zero economy in Europe”.

| №   | Product        | Nudge                                |
|-----|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1   | Google Maps    | Show routes with lower CO2 emissions |
| 2   | Google Flights | Show CO2 emissions                   |

### Sustainability {#sustainability}

***Designing for Sustainability*** encompasses all human activities,
making this pursuit an over-arching challenge across all industries.
Assuming that as individuals we want to act in a sustainable way, how
exactly would be go about doing that?

-   \[see @ieaGlobalEnergyReview2022\] reports “Global CO2 emissions
    from energy combustion and industrial processes rebounded in 2021 to
    reach their highest ever annual level. A 6% increase from 2020
    pushed emissions to 36.3 gigatonnes”

AI can help us make sense of the vast amounts of sustainability data
generated daily.

-   @guptaAnalysisArtificialIntelligencebased2023 argues software is key
    to building more sustainable products, already for decades. More
    recently, companies like AutoDesk are putting CO2 calculations
    inside their design software.

-   @SustainabilityStartsDesign: “Sustainability starts in the design
    process, and AI can help”.

-   @igeniusLetTalkSustainable2020

-   “Carbon pricing is not there to punish people.”

-   “It’s there to remind us, when we take travel, heating, consumption
    decisions that the true cost of fossil fuels comprises not only
    mining and processing, but also the damage done by the CO2 they
    release.”

-   Very simple.” Lion Hirth @lionhirthLionHirthTwitter

-   @chapmanDesignEmotionalDurability2009 argues in his seminal paper
    (and later in his book) for “Emotionally Durable Design”, the simple
    idea that we hold to things we value and thus they are sustainable.
    We don’t throw away a necklace gifted to us by mom, indeed this
    object might be passed down for centuries.
    @roseEnchantedObjectsInnovation2015 has a similar idea, where
    “Enchanted Objects” become so interlinked with us, we’re unlikely to
    throw them away.
