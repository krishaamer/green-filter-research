## Students {#students}

This research focuses on developing an AI companion for ***college students***.

### Personas {#personas}

User research makes extensive use of user ***personas*** to represent a group of people with similar attributes. Designers use personas to ***articulate assumptions,*** which is useful for ***user-centered design*** and also to reflect on what kind of ***biases*** might exist in the design. Within the larger cohort of College Students several different personas could be defined, for example grouping people by interests, knowledge, habits, levels of anxiety, and other attributes.

There is extensive research on the attitudes of U.S. college students towards climate change. American Press Institute (2022) reports only 37% percent of U.S. Generation-Z and Millenials follow news related to environmental issues. Schwartz et al. (2022) reports some adult US students in a small study (18-35, N = 284) express feelings of insignificance of their actions to achieve any meaningful impact. Thomaes et al. (2023) reports U.S. adolescents don’t find sustainability relevant to their daily life. (**rossClimateChangeChallenge2016?**) says most people in the U.S. don’t act on climate change. “Action on climate change has been compromised by uncertainty, aspects of human psychology”.

The above studies give foundation for creating a persona of a U.S. College Student who doesn’t follow environmental news and thinks climate action doesn’t make a difference. This doesn’t necessarily mean this group of people with similar ideas would deny climate change is happening. Rather “Climate Denier” could be another persona, grouping people into a cohort who thinks climate change is not real. Further research would be needed to define relevant personas which have meaningful predictive and generalizing power.

| Description           | Name  | Beliefs                       |
|-----------------------|-------|-------------------------------|
| Climate Change Denier | Jake  | Climate change doesn’t exist. |
|                       | Alice |                               |
|                       | Sam   |                               |

College Student Personas

-   (**crabbRantTerriblePersonas2023?**)

Rooney-Varga et al. (2019) shows the effectiveness of ***The Climate Action Simulation*** in educating users about **success scenarios**.

#### *Design Implications* {#design-implications}

-   **Show Success Scenarios!**

-   Ask how much time you want to contribute.

-   Match with other people based on time.

-   Create a group chatroom.

-   Use AI to help out with tips.

-   Ask university students what do they study and match with that industry to become expert and sustainability leader in this field.

-   People want to help and make a difference. Give people things to do. The Don’t Look Up (n.d.) part of the ***Don’t Look Up*** movie’s social campaign provides 5 user models / roles for the audience to follow: Consumer, Investor, Activist.

-   Choose Your Climate Solutions.

-   Younger people show higher motivation (participants in climate protests). How to be relevant for a younger audience?

-   Yet action remains low.

-   Targeted and gated to college students.

-   FB, etc, Gas all had the same launch strategy - start with students

-   Kuzminski (2015) ecology of money

-   Young people are mobile-first.

-   Persona: I care mostly about… fashion, art, …

-   Young people like to follow trends.

-   Food ordering apps are popular.

-   Monoculture -\> regenerative food forests Oil -\> electric cars / bicycles.

-   Mobile-first.

-   Social

-   Educational

-   Edutainment

-   Fun

-   aespa (2020): Karina from Korea. It makes sense your sustainability assistant would talk to you. Studies show gen N is speaking to computers all the time. Interacting with the user is on the rise. For example, Chime makes tipping suggestions on the place of purchase.

-   The demographics that stand to win the most from the green transformation of business are the youngest generations, with more years of life ahead of them, and more exposure to future environmental and social risks. It would be advisable for Generation Z and their parents (Millennials) to invest their resources in greener assets, however, it’s still difficult to pick and choose between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ financial vehicles to invest in.

-   This creates an opportunity for a new generation of sustainable investment apps, focusing on the usability and accessibility of ESG for a mainstream audience. Generation Z and Millennials expect a consumer-grade user experience.

-   What would that experience look like? I’ve chosen these demographics with the assumption that if given the right tools, the emotional demand for sustainability could be transformed into action. The exploration of systems of feedback to enable consumers to apply more direct positive and negative pressure to the businesses and consumers signal consequences for undesirable ecological performance is a major motivation of this study.

### Climate Anxiety {#climate-anxiety}

A large Hickman et al. (2021) worldwide study (n=10000, aged 16-25) provides evidence the youth is anxious about climate in Australia, Brazil, Finland, France, India, Nigeria, Philippines, Portugal, the UK, and the USA. Similarly, Thompson (2021) finds young people around the world have climate anxiety. Whitmarsh et al. (2022) shows worry about the climate in the UK is generally widespread (over 40% of the respondents, n=1332), while climate anxiety is highest among young people and is a possible motivator for climate action. Additionally, Ogunbode et al. (2022) finds climate anxiety in 32 countries and also supports the idea that climate anxiety leads to climate activism. Thibodeau (2022): “In 2021, the BBC polled 1,000 people in Scotland to understand the barriers to taking climate action. What they found was even though many people were aware of actions needed to take to address climate change, and had intentions to their behaviors didn’t change. This is a phenomenon called the intention-action gap.”

-   Designing for Health and Sustainability: Health and sustainability are intrinsically connected. Kjrgård, Land, and Bransholm Pedersen (2014) shows how *“understanding health and sustainability as a duality, health both creates conditions and is conditioned by sustainability, understood as economic, social and environmental sustainability, while on the other hand sustainability creates and is conditioned by human health”*

-   Design for Human Rights UNFCCC (2023) text refers to “human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment”.

-   Refi podcast: “people need agency”.

-   Martiskainen et al. (2020) (need access)

-   Seabrook (2020) (need access)

-   Older research on young adults (Millenials at the time) highlights how Millenials “use Google as a reference point for ease of use and simplicity” Kate Moran (2016).

#### *Design Implications:* {#design-implications-1}

-   How to support the youth? Design to reduce climate anxiety? Is getting people to go to nature more a good way to increase ecological awareness? Empowered by Design. Youth empowerment: The design should empower young people.
-   Consumer branded carbon credits like angry teenagers?
-   Invest time not money, student don’t have money?

### Embodied Carbon {#embodied-carbon}

-   “embodied carbon”
-   Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance
-   Builders for Climate Action (2021)

### Community {#community}

Humans working together are able to achieve more than single individuals. “Any community on the internet should be able to come together, with capital, and work towards any shared vision. That starts with empowering creators and artists to create and own the culture they’re creating. In the long term this moves to internet communities taking on societal endeavors.”

-   Building a culture of sustainability? (**lakshmirebeccaManWhoGamifying2018?**); (**armstrongCultivatingCulturesSustainability2021?**)

***Zero Waste Lifestyle*** is the opposite of overconsumption. Zero waste suggests people buy in bulk to save. Buying in bulk for more savings and to reduce packaging. Through group purchases and community investing while also reducing consumption.

***Minimalism*** is a movement of people living a simple life. This is always going to be a small percentage of people. Costa (2018): Finnish socialists: minimalism. Tokyo Tokyo Simple Eco Life (2021).

#### *Design Implications* {#design-implications-2}

-   People exist in relation to other people.

-   Psychology of ‘fundraising clubs’ vs individual investing

-   “UkraineDAO Is Bidding on Ukrainian Flag \| PartyBid” (n.d.) Ukraine DAO to support Ukraine through web3.

-   These social movements are small and require too much effort to be feasible for the app? Most college students are not zero waste or minimalist.

-   Group Purchases.

-   Find Your Composting Community.

-   Provides a community for pooling money with like-minded investors.

### Empowerment {#empowerment}

-   I would like to have an AI agent to set my requirements and preferences and give a “fuck you” middle finger to companies that don’t meet them. I could also give a thumbs up to companies that meet my expectations. Perhaps the user interface could like Tinder where I can swipe left and right.

### Memes {#memes}

-   Coined by Richard Dawkins in 1976 in the context of biology.

-   Internet memes and meme stocks

-   Memes from daily life, business to war, are relevant to penetrating through the noise of the web.

-   Memes and sustainability?

-   Meme research has become an academic discipline

-   Memes have become a popular communication tool..

## Data-Driven Design {#data-driven-design}

While data-driven design would usually be structured under Interaction Design, here I will reverse the hierarchy to call attention to the fact data is used in all these approaches to design.

Arrange types of data on a linear axis base on my own judgment.

| Lots of Data | Some Data | ??  | Little Data | No Data            |
|--------------|-----------|-----|-------------|--------------------|
|              |           |     |             | Speculative Design |

Types of design organized by use of data.

## **Interaction Design** {#interaction-design}

There are many approaches to design but the majority share the common goal of designing for a good user experience.

### AI UX Design {#ai-ux-design}

-   Privacy UX (**jarovskyYouAreProbably2022?**)

-   AI UX dark patterns (**jarovskyDarkPatternsAI2022?**)

### Platform Economy {#platform-economy}

The rise of the ***platform economy*** has created global marketplace companies like Airbnb and Uber that match idle resources with retail demand and optimize how our cities work. The massive amounts of data generated by these companies are used by smart cities to re-design their physical environments. With this perspective of scale, what would a shopping experience look like if one knew at the point of sale, which products are greener, and which are more environmentally polluting?

| Enablers of Platform Economics | Good                                                          | Bad                                                                     |
|--------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Network effects                | The more people use a platform, the more valuable it becomes. | Data is not portable. You can’t leave because you’ll lose the audience. |
| Scalability                    |                                                               |                                                                         |
| Data-driven                    |                                                               |                                                                         |
| Behaviour Design               |                                                               |                                                                         |

-   **Network Effects**: The more people use a platform, the more valuable it becomes. Young people are stuck inside platforms. You don’t own the data you put on TikTok. You can’t leave because you’ll lose the audience.

-   Superapps are possible thanks to **Nudge, Economies of Scale, Network Effects, Behaviour Design.** The most successful businesses today (as measured in terms of the number of users) look at the whole user experience. Popular consumer platforms strive to design solutions that feel personalized at every touchpoint on the user journey (to use the language of service design) but doing so at the scale of hundreds of millions (or even billions) of users - personalization at scale.

-   Superapps are honeypots of data that is used for many types of behavior modeling. For example G. Suarez et al. (2021) suggests using alternative data from super-apps to estimate user income levels, including 4 types of data: Personal Information, Consumption Patterns, Payment Information, and Financial services. Also Roa et al. (2021) finds super-app alternative data is especially useful for credit-scoring young, low-wealth individuals.

### Superapps {#superapps}

Superapps are more prevalent in China and South-East Asia.

Giudice (2020) argues WeChat has had a profound impact on changing China into a cashless society, underlining how one mobile app can transform social and financial interactions of an entire country. Vecchi and Brennan (2022) China is the home of many superapps and this paper discusses the strategies taken to expand to other markets. Shabrina Nurqamarani et al. (2020) discusses the system consistency and quality of South–East Asian superapps Gojek and Grab.

#### Sustainability Superapps {#sustainability-superapps}

How to design sustainability superapps? Lots of options in a single app. Fleet Management Weekly (2022) “Sustainability and superapps top Gartner’s Top 10 2023 Trends List”.

### Speculative Design {#speculative-design}

In order to build a better future, it’s important to be able to first imagine a better future. Speculative design makes use of future scenarios to envision contexts and interactions in future use. The term ***speculative design*** was invented by Dunne and Raby (2013) in their seminal book to question the intersection of user experience design and speculative fiction. For example Barendregt and Vaage (2021) explores the potential of speculative design to stimulate public engagement through thought experiments that spur public debate on an issue chosen by the designer.

Phil Balagtas, founder of The Design Futures Initiative at McKinsey, discusses the value of building future scenarios at his talk at Google (Google Design (2019)). One of his examples, the Apple Knowledge Navigator, from an Apple vision video in 1987, took two decades to materialize in the real world. It was inspired by a similar device first shown in a 1970s episode of Star Trek as a **magic device** (a term from participatory design), which then inspired subsequent consumer product development. It took another 2 decades, until the launch of the iPhone in 2007 - a total of 40 years. Imagination is crucial for change.

### Quantified Self {#quantified-self}

There is a lot of research on ***quantified self***. Wearable devices like Apple Watch, Oura Ring, combined with apps help users track a variety of health metrics. Apart from health, wearable devices have been used to track other metrics. Giannakos et al. (2020) used wearable devices to measured physiological parameters of students at school to determine their learning efficiency. Could one track personal sustainability in a similar fashion?

Shin et al. (2019) synthesis review of 463 studies shows wearable devices have potential to influence behavior change towards healthier lifestyles. Saubade et al. (2016) finds health tracking is useful for motivating physical activity. Apple is a leader in health tracking. Apple (2022b): In a 2022 report Apple outlines its plans to : “Empowering people to live a healthier day”. Apple (2022a) Apple’s HealthKit provides a growing list of health metrics. Liu et al. (2019) tracks how wearable data is used for tracking sleep improvements from exercise. Grigsby-Toussaint et al. (2017) Sleep apps and behavioral constructs.

Another aspect is tracking one’s mental health. Tyler, Boldi, and Cherubini (2022) surveys the use of self-reflection apps in the UK (n=998).

Use technology Wearables to be more aware of one’s health.

### User Interfaces {#user-interfaces}

There’s a number of user interface design patterns that have provide successful across a range of social media apps. Such ***user experience / user interface*** (UX/UI) patterns are copied from one app to another, to the extent that the largest apps share a similar look and feature set. Common UX/UI parts include the Feed and Stories. By using common UI parts from social media users have an easier time to accept the innovative parts. add Viz charts. Avatars are increasingly common and new generations are used to talking to computers.

| Feature   | Examples                           |     |
|-----------|------------------------------------|-----|
| Feed      |                                    |     |
| Post      | Apple App Store                    |     |
| Stories   | IG, FB, WhatsApp, SnapChat, TikTok |     |
| Comment   |                                    |     |
| Reactions |                                    |     |

Common Social Media UI Parts

There are also more philosophical approaches to ***Interface Studies:*** David Hoang (2022), the head of product design at Webflow, suggests taking cues from art studies to ***isolate the core problem***. “An art study is any action done with the intention of learning about the subject you want to draw”. As a former art student, Hoang looks at an interface as *“a piece of design is an artwork with function”*.

### Digital Product Design {#digital-product-design}

Design is as much about how it works as it’s about the interface.

Digital product design can be seen as a specific discipline under the umbrella of **Experience Design**. In Michael Abrash (2017) Meta Oculus augmented reality incubation general manager Laura Fryer: “People buy experiences, not technology.”

Young people expect a product. Intelligent Interfaces use interaction design to provide relevant and personalized information in the right context and at the right time.

Ceschin and Gaziulusoy (2016) shows how design for sustainability has expanded from a product focus to systems-thinking focus placing the product inside a societal context of use. For example “Cargo Bike \| FREITAG” (n.d.), Recycled clothing maker FREITAG offers sustainability-focused services such ass cargo bikes so you can transport your purchases and a network for *shopping without payment* = swapping your items with other members, as well as repairs of their products. Loaning terminology from ***service design***, the user journey within an app needs to consider each touchpoint on the way to a state of success.

Weinschenk (2011) says “People expect most online interactions to follow the same social rules as person-to-person interactions. It’s a shortcut that your brain uses to quickly evaluate trustworthiness.”

The small screen estate space of mobiles phones and smart watches necessitates displaying content in a dynamic manner. Virtual reality glasses (called AR/VR or XR in marketing speak) need dynamic content because the user is able to move around the environment. Both are questions that interaction design is called upon to solve. Hoang (2022): “Dynamic interfaces might invoke a new design language for extended reality”.

Speaking is one mode of interaction that’s become increasingly possible as machines learn to interpret human language.

| Mode of Interaction |     |
|---------------------|-----|
| Writing             |     |
| Speaking            |     |
| Touching            |     |
| Moving              |     |
|                     |     |

Modes of interaction

Coputer

Humans respond well to ***storytelling***, making ***character design*** and ***narrative design*** relevant to interaction design. Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are able to assume the personality of any character that exists inside of its training data, creating opportunities for automated narrative design.

#### *Design Implications:* {#design-implications-4}

-   Rebuilt the app as a personalized, narrative lifestyle feed.
-   Your shopping products mostly come from Protector and Gamble (3x) and Nestle. These are large conglomerates with a massive CO2 footprint. See the index to find some alternatives.
-   How the design can connect people to sustainable outcomes while shopping and investing? Perhaps even forming a community of sustainable action. What I showed in class looks like an app but it could also be a physical object (a speculative design). From the presentations I saw most students seemed to be interested in form and light (many lamps) and a couple were about medical uses. I don’t remember seeing one that could be compatible with the environmental sustainability focus unfortunately…

### Narrative Design {#narrative-design}

-   Narrative design bring together film school **storytelling** experience with design.

### Behavioral Design: Gamification & Nudge {#behavioral-design-gamification-nudge}

The literature on ***nudge*** is huge, as marketers and researchers try to find ways to affect human behaviors towards making more purchase decisions in commerce, both offline and online. First coined by the Nobel-winning economist Thaler and Sunstein (2009) in 2008, nudges are based on specific understanding of human psychology and shortcuts and triggers that human brains use and leverages that knowledge to influence humans in small but powerful ways. The same principles and tricks have also been applied to sustainability. For example, a small study (n=33) in the Future Consumer Lab in Copenhagen by Perez-Cueto (2021) found that designing a “dish-of-the-day” which was prominently displayed helped to increase vegetarian food choice by 85%. Guath, Stikvoort, and Juslin (2022) experiments (n=200) suggested nudging can be effective in influencing online shopping behavior towards more sustainable options. A larger scale study of behavior change in Australia maps how to avoid “16 billion paper coffee cups are being thrown away every year” Novoradovskaya et al. (2021).

Google currently offers a “Green Filter” in Google Flights and Google maps, which allow filtering flights and driving routes by less CO2 emissions, as well as surfacing hotels with Green Key and EarthCheck credentials, while promising new sustainability features across its portfolio of products Sundar Pichai (2021). Green tools inside Google’s online platforms are small user interface nudges which Google’s research calls ***digital decarbonization***, defined by Implement Consulting Group (2022) as “Maximising the enabling role of digital technologies by accelerating already available digital solutions”. In Kate Brandt and Matt Brittin (2022), Google’s Chief Sustainability Officer Kate Brandt set a target of “at least 20-25%” CO2 emission reductions in Europe to reach a net-zero economy and the global announcement set a target of helping 1 billion people make more sustainable choices around the world (Jeni Miles (2022)). In addition to end–users, Google offers digital decarbonizationsoftware for developers, including the Google Cloud Carbon Footprint tool Google (2023) and invests in regenerative agriculture projects “Inside Google’s Regenerative Agriculture Play \| Greenbiz” (2021).

#### *Design Implications* {#design-implications-6}

-   What if there was a “Green Filter” on every product everywhere?
-   Become a Sustainability-Aware App or Game.

### Life-Centered Design {#life-centered-design}

-   From Human-Centered to Life-Centered Design: (**borthwickHumancentredLifecentredDesign2022?**) proposes a framework for life-centered design, “the design phase of a physical product accounts for 80% of its environmental impact”

## Design for Sustainability {#design-for-sustainability}

Sustainability touches every facet of human existence and is thus an enormous undertaking. Making progress on sustainability is only possible if there’s a large-scale coordinated effort by humans around the planet. For this to happen, some technological tools are helpful.

-   **Guided Sustainability** “refers to a concept of using technology, such as AI and machine learning, to help individuals and organizations make more sustainable decisions and take actions that promote environmental and social sustainability. This can include things like analyzing data on resource usage and emissions, providing recommendations for reducing the environmental impact of operations, or helping to identify and track progress towards sustainability goals. The goal of guided sustainability is to make it easier for people to understand their impact on the environment and to take steps to reduce that impact.”
-   Sanchez et al. (2022) LoRaWAN
-   There are many examples of combination of AI and human, also known as “human-in-the-loop”, used for fields as diverse as training computer vision algorithms for self-driving cars Wu et al. (2023) and detection of disinformation in social media posts: Bonet-Jover et al. (2023). However Krügel, Ostermaier, and Uhl (2023) finds humans don’t necessarily correct mistakes made by computers and may instead become “partners in crime”.
-   Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence Ge Wang (2019)

Examples of human-in-the-loop apps

#### *Design Implications* {#design-implications-7}

-   Guidance could help young people beat climate anxiety by taking meaningful action.

-   The app is just as much about helping people deal with climate anxiety as it’s with solving the climate issue.

-   List of metrics that should be tracked to enable useful analytics. Ex: % of beach pollution, air pollution, water pollution (I had this idea while meditating). In essence, “green filter” is a central data repository not unlike “Apple Health for Sustainability”.

-   Health and fitness category apps

-   Using “green filter” you can get a personalized sustainability plan and personal coach to become healthy and nature-friendly.

-   All green categories — Green hub — Ask the user to prioritize

-   In my “green filter” AI advisor app’s scenario, the AI is scanning for opportunities matching the user’s sustainable investment appetite and risk profile, using different methods of analysis, including alternative data sources. Traditionally, financial analysts only looked at traditional data, such as company reports, government reports, historic performance, etc., for preparing advisory guidance to their clients. With the advent of AI and big data analysis, many other options of research data have become available, for example, accurate weather predictions for agriculture can affect guidance, because of expected future weather disasters in the area. Other examples include policy predictions, pollution metrics, etc.

-   Professional financial advisors use automated tools to analyze data and present it in human form to clients. Today’s ubiquitous mobile interfaces, however, provide the opportunity to ‘cut out the middleman’ and provide similar information to clients directly, at a lower cost and a wider scale, often without human intervention. Additional (more expensive) “human-judgment- as-a-service”, a combination of robots + human input, can help provide further personalized advice for the consumer, still at a cheaper price than a dedicated human advisor. Everyone can have a financial advisor.
