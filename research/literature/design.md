## College Students {#college-students}

### Climate Anxiety {#climate-anxiety}

@whitmarshClimateAnxietyWhat2022 shows climate anxiety is prevalent
among young people and is a possible motivator for climate action.
@ogunbodeClimateAnxietyWellbeing2022 finds climate anxiety in 32
countries and also supports the idea that climate anxiety leads to
climate activism. @hickmanClimateAnxietyChildren2021 provides more
evidence even children are anxious about climate.

-   @thompsonYoungPeopleClimate2021 Young people have climate anxiety.

-   Designing for Health and Sustainability: Health and sustainability
    are intrinsically connected. @kjaergardHealthSustainability2014
    shows how *“understanding health and sustainability as a duality,
    health both creates conditions and is conditioned by sustainability,
    understood as economic, social and environmental sustainability,
    while on the other hand sustainability creates and is conditioned by
    human health”*

-   Finds that climate anxiety predicts joining climate action
    movements.

-   Design for Human Rights @unfcccSharmElSheikhImplementation2023 text
    refers to “human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable
    environment”.

-   Refi podcast: people need agency.

-   @martiskainenContextualizingClimateJustice2020 (need access)

-   @seabrookMusicTherapyEra2020 (need access)

-   Older research on young adults (Millenials at the time) highlights
    how Millenials “use Google as a reference point for ease of use and
    simplicity” @katemoranDesigningYoungAdults2016.

***Design Implications:***

-   How to support the youth? Design to reduce climate anxiety? Is
    getting people to go to nature more a good way to increase
    ecological awareness? Empowered by Design. Youth empowerment: The
    design should empower young people.
-   Consumer branded carbon credits like angry teenagers?
-   Invest time not money, student don’t have money?

### Personas & Community {#personas-community}

User research makes extensive use of ***personas*** to represent a group
of people with similar attributes. Designers use personas to
***articulate assumptions,*** which is useful for ***user-centered
design*** and also to reflect on what kind of ***biases*** might exist
in the design.

Within the larger group of College Students there are several different
personas, with different interests, knowledge, habits, levels of
anxiety, etc.

@americanpressinstituteKnowingNewsHow2022 reports only 37% percent of
U.S. Generation-Z and Millenials follow news related to environmental
issues and @thomaesGreenTeensUnderstanding2023 reports U.S. adolescents
don’t find sustainability relevant to their daily life.
@rossClimateChangeChallenge2016 says most people in the U.S. don’t act
on climate change. “Action on climate change has been compromised by
uncertainty, aspects of human psychology”. Meanwhile,
@schwartzClimateChangeAnxiety2022 reports some adult US students (18-35,
N = 284) express feelings of insignificance of their actions to achieve
any meaningful impact. Conversly,
@RooneyVargaClimateActionSimulation2019 shows the effectiveness of
***The Climate Action Simulation*** in educating users about **success
scenarios**.

***Zero Waste Lifestyle*** is the opposite of overconsumption. Zero
waste suggests people buy in bulk to save. Buying in bulk for more
savings and to reduce packaging. Through group purchases and community
investing while also reducing consumption.

***Minimalism*** is a movement of people living a simple life. This is
always going to be a small percentage of people.
@costaHowFinnishCulture2018: Finnish socialists: minimalism. Tokyo
@tokyosimpleecolifeWhatLearnedMy2021.

There’s a number of user interface design patterns that have provide
successful across a range of social media apps, copied from one to
another, to the extent that the largest social media apps share a
similar look and feature set. Common UI parts. Feed. Stories. By using
common UI parts from social media users have an easier time to accept
the innovative parts. add Viz charts. Avatars are increasingly common
and new generations are used to talking to computers.

**Design Implications:**

-   **Show Success Scenarios!**

-   Ask how much time you want to contribute.

-   Match with other people based on time.

-   Create a group chatroom.

-   Use AI to help out with tips.

-   Ask university students what do they study and match with that
    industry to become expert and sustainability leader in this field

-   People want to help and make a difference. Give people things to do.
    The @dontlookupMethodology part of the ***Don’t Look Up*** movie’s
    social campaign provides 5 user models / roles for the audience to
    follow: Consumer, Investor, Activist.

-   These social movements are small and require too much effort to be
    feasible for the app? Most college students are not zero waste or
    minimalist.

-   Choose Your Climate Solutions

-   Group Purchases

-   Find Your Composting Community

-   Younger people show higher motivation (participants in climate
    protests). How to be relevant for a younger audience?

-   Yet action remains low.

-   Targeted and gated to college students.

-   FB, etc, Gas all had the same launch strategy - start with students

-   @kuzminskiEcologyMoneyDebt2015 ecology of money

-   Young people are mobile-first.

-   Persona: I care mostly about… fashion, art, …

-   People exist in relation to other people.

-   Psychology of ‘fundraising clubs’ vs individual investing

-   @UkraineDAOBiddingUkrainian Ukraine DAO to support Ukraine through
    web3.

-   Young people like to follow trends.

-   Food ordering apps are popular.

-   Monoculture -\> regenerative food forests Oil -\> electric cars /
    bicycles

-   Mobile-first

-   Provides a community for pooling money with like-minded investors

-   Social

-   Educational

-   Edutainment

-   Fun

-   Stories section like IG / app store.

-   @aespaAespaEseupaMY2020: Karina from Korea. It makes sense your
    sustainability assistant would talk to you. Studies show gen N is
    speaking to computers all the time. Interacting with the user is on
    the rise. For example, Chime makes tipping suggestions on the place
    of purchase.

-   The demographics that stand to win the most from the green
    transformation of business are the youngest generations, with more
    years of life ahead of them, and more exposure to future
    environmental and social risks. It would be advisable for Generation
    Z and their parents (Millennials) to invest their resources in
    greener assets, however, it’s still difficult to pick and choose
    between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ financial vehicles to invest in.

-   This creates an opportunity for a new generation of sustainable
    investment apps, focusing on the usability and accessibility of ESG
    for a mainstream audience. Generation Z and Millennials expect a
    consumer-grade user experience.

-   What would that experience look like? I’ve chosen these demographics
    with the assumption that if given the right tools, the emotional
    demand for sustainability could be transformed into action. The
    exploration of systems of feedback to enable consumers to apply more
    direct positive and negative pressure to the businesses and
    consumers signal consequences for undesirable ecological performance
    is a major motivation of this study.

## **Interaction Design** {#interaction-design}

### Speculative Design {#speculative-design}

Imagination is crucial: in order to build a better future, it’s
important to be able to first imagine a better future. Speculative
design makes use of future scenarios to envision contexts and
interactions in future use. The term ***speculative design*** was
invented by @dunneSpeculativeEverythingDesign2013 in their seminal book
to question the intersection of user experience design and speculative
fiction. For example @BARENDREGT2021374 explores the potential of
speculative design to stimulate public engagement through thought
experiments that spur public debate on an issue chosen by the designer.

Phil Balagtas, founder of The Design Futures Initiative at McKinsey,
discusses the value of building future scenarios at his talk at Google
(@googledesignDesignSpeculativeFutures2019). One of his examples, the
Apple Knowledge Navigator, from an Apple vision video in 1987, took two
decades to materialize in the real world. It was inspired by a similar
device first shown in a 1970s episode of Star Trek as a **magic device**
(a term from participatory design), which then inspired subsequent
consumer product development. It took another 2 decades, until the
launch of the iPhone in 2007 - a total of 40 years.

### Quantified Self {#quantified-self}

There is a lot of research on ***quantified self***. Wearable devices
like Apple Watch, Oura Ring, combined with apps help users track a
variety of health metrics. Apart from health, wearable devices have been
used to track other metrics. @giannakosFitbitLearningCapturing2020 used
wearable devices to measured physiological parameters of students at
school to determine their learning efficiency. Could one track personal
sustainability in a similar fashion?

@shinWearableActivityTrackers2019 synthesis review of 463 studies shows
wearable devices have potential to influence behavior change towards
healthier lifestyles. @saubadePromotingPhysicalActivity2016 finds health
tracking is useful for motivating physical activity. Apple is a leader
in health tracking. @appleEmpoweringPeopleLive2022: In a 2022 report
Apple outlines its plans to : “Empowering people to live a healthier
day”. @appleWhatNewHealthKit2022 Apple’s HealthKit provides a growing
list of health metrics. @liuHowPhysicalExercise2019 tracks how wearable
data is used for tracking sleep improvements from exercise.

Another aspect is tracking one’s mental health.
@tylerContemporarySelfreflectivePractices2022 surveys the use of
self-reflection apps in the UK (n=998).

Use technology Wearables to be more aware of one’s health.

-   Figure 9: Popular Strava sports assistant provides run tracking and
    feedback. AI Financial Advisors will need to go further to motivate
    users. because of the nature of the technology, which is based on
    the quality of the data the systems ingest, they are prone to
    mistakes.

```mdx-code-block
<Figure caption="Figure 9: Popular Strava sports assistant provides run tracking and feedback - AI Financial Advisors will need to go further to motivate users. " src={Strava} />
```

-   There is a parallel in health to sustainability and indeed both are
    inextricably linked.

-   The urban environment has an influence on health.
    @delclos-alioWalkingTransportationLarge2022 discusses walking in
    Latin American cities. Walking is the most sustainable method or
    transport but requires the availability of city infrastructure, such
    as sidewalks, which many cities still lack.

***Design Implications:***

-   What would that look like for sustainability?

-   Empowering people to live a sustainable day

### Digital Product Design {#digital-product-design}

Young people expect a product.

@ceschinEvolutionDesignSustainability2016 shows how design for
sustainability has expanded from a product focus to systems-thinking
focus placing the product inside a societal context of use. For example
@CargoBikeFREITAG, Recycled clothing maker FREITAG offers
sustainability-focused services such ass cargo bikes so you can
transport your purchases and a network for *shopping without payment* =
swapping your items with other members, as well as repairs of their
products. Loaning terminology from ***service design***, the user
journey within an app needs to consider each touchpoint on the way to a
state of success.

@weinschenk100ThingsEvery2011 says “People expect most online
interactions to follow the same social rules as person-to-person
interactions. It’s a shortcut that your brain uses to quickly evaluate
trustworthiness.”

Interface Studies: @davidhoangCreatingInterfaceStudies2022, the head of
product design at Webflow, suggests taking cues from art studies to
***isolate the core problem***. “An art study is any action done with
the intention of learning about the subject you want to draw”. As a
former art student, Hoang looks at an interface as *“a piece of design
is an artwork with function”*.

-   Part of digital product design are **design systems** to keep
    consistency across the experience. Create a design system to best to
    showcase my analytic skills:

-   **Experience Design**
    -   In @michaelabrashInventingFuture2017 Meta Oculus AR Incubation
        GM Laura Fryer: “People buy experiences, not technology.”
    -   @hoangEnterDynamicIsland2022: “Dynamic interfaces might invoke a
        new design language for XR”
-   **Intelligent Interfaces use interaction design to provide relevant
    and personalized information in the right context and at the right
    time.**
-   @kolkoThoughtsInteractionDesign2010 and @ixdfWhatInteractionDesign
    believe interaction design is still an emerging (and changing) field
    and there are many definitions. I prefer the simplest version:
    interaction design is about creating a conversation between the
    product and the user.
-   AI gives designers new tools. In AI development, design is called
    alignment. What is the role of an AI Designer? @lindenWhatRoleAI2021
-   @PeopleAIGuidebook
-   @LanguageModelSketchbook
-   @parundekarEssentialGuideCreating2021
-   @richardyangInteractionDesignMore2021 and
    @justinbakerRedRoutesCritical2018 say some of the tools used by
    interaction designers include
-   @oviyamtmRedRouteApplication2019; @InteractionDesignHow2021;
    @xuanHowPrioritiseProduct2022 Red Route Analysis
-   AI for design: @AINextChapter2023
-   Social Objects: People need something to gather around and discuss.
    @sharing.labWhatSocialObject2015: I’m interested in the concept of a
    “social object”.

Creating a good product depends on ***Data-Driven Design***

-   Product marketers focus on the ***stickiness*** of the product,
    meaning low attrition, meaning people keep coming back.
-   What percent of all design is “sustainable design” ? Promoting
    sustainable design.
-   “Any community on the internet should be able to come together, with
    capital, and work towards any shared vision. That starts with
    empowering creators and artists to create and own the culture
    they’re creating. In the long term this moves to internet
    communities taking on societal endeavors.”

-   @jeffjohnrobertsDigitalArtAwaits2020

***Design Implications:***

-   Rebuilt the app as a personalized, narrative lifestyle feed.
-   Your shopping products mostly come from Protector and Gamble (3x)
    and Nestle. These are large conglomerates with a massive CO2
    footprint. See the index to find some alternatives.
-   How the design can connect people to sustainable outcomes while
    shopping and investing? Perhaps even forming a community of
    sustainable action. What I showed in class looks like an app but it
    could also be a physical object (a speculative design). From the
    presentations I saw most students seemed to be interested in form
    and light (many lamps) and a couple were about medical uses. I don’t
    remember seeing one that could be compatible with the environmental
    sustainability focus unfortunately…

### Narrative Design {#narrative-design}

-   The rising availability of AI assistants however may displace Google
    search with a more conversational UX. Indeed, Google itself is
    working on smarter tools to displace their own main product, as
    exemplified by Google Assistant, Google Bard and large investments
    into LLMs.

-   @aletheaaiAletheaAIAI2021: discusses writing AI Characters, creating
    a personality.

-   Writing as training data? large language models. GTP3.

-   Stories start with a character.

-   Large language models such as ChatGPT are able to assume the
    personality of any character that exists inside of its training
    data, creating opportunities for automated narrative design.

***Design Implications:***

-   Narrative design bring together film school **storytelling**
    experience with design.

### Behavioral Design: Gamification & Nudge {#behavioral-design-gamification-nudge}

The literature on *nudge* is huge, as researches try to find ways to
affect human behaviors towards sustainability. Some notable examples:

-   Gamification makes uses of nudges.
-   Nudges are based on specific understanding of human psychology and
    shortcuts and triggers that human brains use and uses that knowledge
    to influence humans in small but powerful ways.
-   A small study (n = 33) @perez-cuetoNudgingPlantbasedMeals2021 in the
    Future Consumer Lab in Copenhagen found that designing a
    “dish-of-the-day” which was prominently displayed helped to increase
    vegetarian food choice by 85%.
-   @ERIKSSON2023229 discusses best practices for reducing food waste in
    Sweden.
-   @novoradovskayaMyCupTea2021 “16 billion paper coffee cups are being
    thrown away every year”. Study of behavior change in Australia.
    **(Need access!)**
-   @ACUTI2023122151 makes the point that physical proximity to a
    drop-off point helps people participate in sustainability.
-   @GUATH2022101821 experiments (n=200) suggested nudging can be
    effective in influencing online shopping behavior towards more
    sustainable options.
-   @WEE2021100364 proposes 7 types of nudging technique based on an
    overview of 37 papers in the field.

| Name              | Technique                                                                                 |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Prompting         | Create cues and reminders to perform a certain behavior                                   |
| Sizing            | Decrease or increase the size of items or portions                                        |
| Proximity         | Change the physical (or temporal) distance of options                                     |
| Presentation      | Change the way items are displayed                                                        |
| Priming           | Expose users to certain stimuli before decision-making                                    |
| Labelling         | Provide labels to influence choice (for example CO2 footprint labels)                     |
| Functional Design | Design the environment and choice architecture so the desired behavior is more convenient |

One example of ***nudge*** are the small UI updates released by Google
across its portfolio of products: Google Flights and Google maps.
Google’s research introduces the concept of *digital decarbonization*,
which @implementconsultinggroupHowDigitalSector2022 defines as
“Maximising the enabling role of digital technologies by accelerating
already available digital solutions”. In
@katebrandtGoogleClimateAction2022, Google’s Chief Sustainability
Officer Kate Brandt suggests “Digital solutions play an important
enabling role for at least 20-25% of the reductions required to achieve
a net-zero economy in Europe”.

Google offers a “Green Filter” on Maps, Flights, etc. What if there was
a “Green Filter” on every product everywhere?
@jenimilesBecomingSustainabilityAwareApp2022 suggests “Google recently
shared its goal to help one billion people make more sustainable choices
by embedding carbon emissions information into Google Flights and
surfacing whether a hotel is Green Key or EarthCheck certified.”
@googleCarbonFootprint2023 Google Cloud Carbon Footprint tool.
@sundarpichaiGivingYouMore2021 sustainability tools inside Google’s

***Design Implications:***

-   Becoming a Sustainability-Aware App or Game.

### Platforms & Superapps {#platforms-superapps}

-   The rise of the ***platform economy*** has given us marketplace
    companies like Airbnb and Uber that match idle resources with retail
    demand and optimize how our cities work. The massive amounts of data
    generated by these companies are used by smart cities to re-design
    their physical environments. With this perspective of scale, what
    would a shopping experience look like if one knew at the point of
    sale, which products are greener, and which are more environmentally
    polluting?

-   Network Effects: The more people use a platform, the more valuable
    it becomes. Young people are stuck inside platforms. You don’t own
    the data you put on TikTok. You can’t leave because you’ll lose the
    audience.

-   Superapps are possible **thanks to Nudge.** The most successful
    businesses today (as measured in terms of the number of users) look
    at the whole user experience. Popular consumer platforms strive to
    design solutions that feel personalized at every touchpoint on the
    user journey (to use the language of service design) but doing so at
    the scale of hundreds of millions (or even billions) of users -
    personalization at scale.

-   Superapps are honeypots of data that is used for many types of
    modeling. For example @suarezEnhancingUserIncome2021 suggests using
    alternative data from super-apps to estimate user income levels,
    including 4 types of data: Personal Information, Consumption
    Patterns, Payment Information, and Financial services. Also
    @roaSuperappBehavioralPatterns2021 finds super-app alternative data
    is especially useful for credit-scoring young, low-wealth
    individuals.

-   WeChat @giudice2020wechat MA thesis’s argues WeChat has had a
    profound impact on changing China into a cashless society,
    underlining how one mobile app can transform social and financial
    interactions of an entire country.
    @vecchiTwoTalesInternationalization2022 China is the home of many
    superapps and this paper discusses the strategies taken to expand to
    other markets. @shabrinanurqamaraniEFFECTSMOBILESERVICE2020
    discusses the system consistency and quality of South–East Asian
    superapps Gojek and Grab.

-   How to design sustainability superapps? Lots of options in a single
    app. @fleetmanagementweeklySustainableSuperappShows2022
    “Sustainability and superapps top Gartner’s Top 10 2023 Trends
    List”. @davewallaceRiseCarboncentricSuper2021 “The rise of
    carbon-centric super apps”. @goodbagGoodbagSustainableSuper2023
    “goodbag: Sustainable Super App”. What would a sustainable
    investment platform that matches green investments with the
    consumers look like, if one saw the side-by-side comparison of
    investment vehicles on their ESG performance? Also

## Education {#education}

Sustainability touches every facet of human existence and is thus an
enormous undertaking. Making progress on sustainability is only possible
if there’s a large-scale coordinated effort by humans around the planet.
For this to happen, some technological tools are required.

-   **Guided Sustainability** “refers to a concept of using technology,
    such as AI and machine learning, to help individuals and
    organizations make more sustainable decisions and take actions that
    promote environmental and social sustainability. This can include
    things like analyzing data on resource usage and emissions,
    providing recommendations for reducing the environmental impact of
    operations, or helping to identify and track progress towards
    sustainability goals. The goal of guided sustainability is to make
    it easier for people to understand their impact on the environment
    and to take steps to reduce that impact.”

Examples of human-in-the-loop apps

***Design Implications:***

-   Guidance could help young people beat climate anxiety by taking
    meaningful action.

-   The app is just as much about helping people deal with climate
    anxiety as it’s with solving the climate issue.

-   List of metrics that should be tracked to enable useful analytics.
    Ex: % of beach pollution, air pollution, water pollution (I had this
    idea while meditating). In essence, “green filter” is a central data
    repository not unlike “Apple Health for Sustainability”.

-   Health and fitness category apps

-   Using “green filter” you can get a personalized sustainability plan
    and personal coach to become healthy and nature-friendly.

-   All green categories — Green hub — Ask the user to prioritize

-   In my “green filter” AI advisor app’s scenario, the AI is scanning
    for opportunities matching the user’s sustainable investment
    appetite and risk profile, using different methods of analysis,
    including alternative data sources. Traditionally, financial
    analysts only looked at traditional data, such as company reports,
    government reports, historic performance, etc., for preparing
    advisory guidance to their clients. With the advent of AI and big
    data analysis, many other options of research data have become
    available, for example, accurate weather predictions for agriculture
    can affect guidance, because of expected future weather disasters in
    the area. Other examples include policy predictions, pollution
    metrics, etc.

-   Professional financial advisors use automated tools to analyze data
    and present it in human form to clients. Today’s ubiquitous mobile
    interfaces, however, provide the opportunity to ‘cut out the
    middleman’ and provide similar information to clients directly, at a
    lower cost and a wider scale, often without human intervention.
    Additional (more expensive) “human-judgment- as-a-service”, a
    combination of robots + human input, can help provide further
    personalized advice for the consumer, still at a cheaper price than
    a dedicated human advisor. Everyone can have a financial advisor.
