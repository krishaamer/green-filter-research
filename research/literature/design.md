# Design for Sustainability {#design-for-sustainability}

## What is Sustainability? {#what-is-sustainability}

*Sustainability* was first mentioned in 1713 by *Hans Carl von Carlowitz* in the context of forestry in his seminal book (Hannß Carl von Carlowitz (1713)) discussing sustainable forest management, today known as *sustainable yield* of *natural capital* required to maintain *ecosystem services* (Peter Kareiva et al. (2011)). Contemporary studies have shown *biodiversity* as one key factor to maintain delivery of ecosystem services (Le Provost et al. (2022)).

***Designing for Sustainability*** encompasses all human activites, making a ***design for sustainability*** an over-arching challenge across all industries.

“Global CO2 emissions from energy combustion and industrial processes1 rebounded in 2021 to reach their highest ever annual level. A 6% increase from 2020 pushed emissions to 36.3 gigatonnes (Gt” (IEA (2022))

Growing public understanding of how nature works and intersects with our use of money.

## Design for Circularity {#design-for-circularity}

## Population {#population}

In November 2022, Planet Earth’s population reached 8 Billion people ((**theeconomictimesClimateChangeEarth?**))

Projections show 9 Billion by 2050

## Overconsumption {#overconsumption}

Overconsumption is one of the root causes of climate change and marine plastic pollution. Ford et al. (2022) suggest linkage of climate change and marine plastic pollution “along with other stressors that threaten the resilience of species and habitats sensitive to both climate change and plastic pollution”.

## Fossil Fuels and Energy {#fossil-fuels-and-energy}

There’s evidence from several countries suggesting moving to renewal energy brings benefits:

-   Amin et al. (2022) suggests “removing fossil fuel subsidies and intra-sectoral electricity price distortions coupled with carbon taxes provides the highest benefits” for both the economy and the environment in Bangladesh.

## Carbon Labelling {#carbon-labelling}

CO2 label for consumer products have been proposed for a long time (Adam Corner (2012)). While academic literature has looked at minute detail such as color and positioning of the label (Zhou et al. (2019)) and there is some indication consumers are willing to pay a small premium for low-CO2 products (Xu & Lin (2022)), the idea is yet to find mainstream adoption. Although labeling low CO2 food enables people to choose a *climatarian diet*, their impact on the market share of low-carbon meals is negible (Lohmann et al. (2022)).

## Sustainable Finance {#sustainable-finance}

UNEP has identified that if the world is to meet its climate change, biodiversity, and land degradation targets, it needs to close a \$4.1 trillion financing gap in nature by 2050. The stakes are higher than ever, biodiversity and nature must be at the forefront of the COP27 climate agenda.  https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/unep-and-green-finance-institute-partner-podcast-series-nature-ahead

“We can and must channel private capital into nature-based solutions. This will require policy and regulatory support, catalytic capital and financial innovation. Ahead of COP27 in Egypt, Financing Nature: COP27 Special will showcase examples of where this is already happening, and discuss what we collectively must do to mobilise capital at scale” said Dr Rhian-Mari Thomas, Chief Executive Officer, GFI. https://www.greenfinanceinstitute.co.uk/

## Carbon Markets {#carbon-markets}

“The Emissions Gap Report (EGR) 2021: The Heat Is On shows that new national climate pledges combined with other mitigation measures put the world on track for a global temperature rise of 2.7°C by the end of the century. That is well above the goals of the Paris climate agreement and would lead to catastrophic changes in the Earth’s climate. To keep global warming below 1.5°C this century, the aspirational goal of the Paris Agreement, the world needs to halve annual greenhouse gas emissions in the next eight years. @

If implemented effectively, net-zero emissions pledges could limit warming to 2.2°C, closer to the well-below 2°C goal of the Paris Agreement. However, many national climate plans delay action until after 2030. The reduction of methane emissions from the fossil fuel, waste and agriculture sectors could help close the emissions gap and reduce warming in the short term, the report finds.

Carbon markets could also help slash emissions. But that would only happen if rules are clearly defined and target actual reductions in emissions, while being supported by arrangements to track progress and provide transparency. “ https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021

-   “The (Social Cost of Carbon) SCC measures the additional damage caused by an extra unit of emissions” (Kornek et al. (2021); Zhen et al. (2018)) with variations between countries (Tol (2019)) and regions (Y. Wang et al. (2022)).

-   carbon-neutral economy needs higher CO2 prices (Stern (2022))

-   oceans play crucial role in carbon capture (Howard et al. (2017))

-   Carbon prices are highly asymmetric (Ritz (2022))

-   Apart from CO2, reduction of other atmospheric pollutants, such as non-CO2 greenhouse gases (GHGs) and short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) is required for climate stability (Lin et al. (2022))

-   As shown in the Phillipines by Cheng & Han (2022), with increasing extreme weather events, “businesses are more likely to emerge in areas where infrastructure is resilient to climate hazards”

-   In California, “Wildfires are the second most important source of emissions in 2020” and “Wildfires in 2020 negate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from other sectors.” Jerrett et al. (2022)

-   Quantifying climate damage (T.-P. Wang & Teng (2022)) proposes scenarious of climate damage

## Ecosystem Services {#ecosystem-services}

There’s evidence paying landovners for the ecosystem services their forests provide may reduce deforestation (Bousfield et al. (2022)). Estonian startups Arbonic and Single.Earth are trialing this approach in several forests.

Han & Chen (2022) identifies nature-based ssolutions “land re-naturalization (such as afforestation and wetland restoration)”

## Supply Chains {#supply-chains}

Several startups are using distributed ledgers (blockchains) to track source material to the factories ad product movements from factories to markets. While blockchains enable securely tracing data, which is immutablet (no possible to change the same record, only update data in new records), the system still relies on correct data input. As the saying goes, “garbage in, garbage out”. Indeed, the blockchain is most useful for auditing, as the time and place of data input can be guaranteed, it will be easier to conduct a search on who inpputted incorrect data.

The blockchain supply chain companies as of October 2022 include:

Another aspect of supply tracing is the treatment of workers and working conditions. Companies that intend to 2give supply chain a voice” by connecting workers directly to the consumer (even in anonymously, to protect the workers from retribution), include *CTMFile* and *Alexandria*.

“factory social score”.

People working at the factories can report conditions

“But the real breakthrough is how we can surface that real-time ESG data directly to individuals in the shops and online, linked to the products that they are browsing and potentially buying. This means that ESG change will finally be driven by the ultimate judge of business success – the customer.”

I’m interested in the concept of a “social object” https://medium.com/we-research-and-expriment-with-how-the-sharing/what-is-a-social-object-8dd52df0f15c and how the design can connect people to sustainable outcomes while shopping and investing. Perhaps even forming a community of sustainable action. What I showed in class looks like an app but it could also be a physical object (a speculative design). From the presentations I saw most students seemed to be interested in form and light (many lamps) and a couple were about medical uses. I don’t remember seeing one that could be compatible with the environmental sustainabilty focus unfortunately…

## Interface Studies {#interface-studies}

Head of Product Design at Webflow (David Hoang (2022)) suggests taking cues from art studies to *isolate the core problem*. “An art study is any action done with the intention of learning about the subject you want to draw”. As a former art student, Hoang looks at an interface as *“a piece of design is an artwork with function”*.

## Speculative Design {#speculative-design}

“Speculative Design” for a sustainability assistant

-   Barendregt & Vaage (2021)
-   Google Design (2019)
-   (**anthonydunneSpeculativeEverything2013?**)

— all green categories — Green hub — Ask the user to prioritize

Neri Oxman, biomaterials MIT media lab, 15. sept. 2020 —

Neri Oxman’s expressions: “ecology-indifferent” “naturing”“mother naturing” “design is a practice of letting go of all that is unneccesary” “nature should be our single client”

speculative design use imagination

-   Societal movements change things: implication for design: build a community
-   Processes sustain things: implication for design: built an app

## Experience Design {#experience-design}

“People buy experiences, not technology.”

— Loaning terminology from service design, the user journey within an app needs to consider about touchpoint on the way to a state of success.

Mobile App Design There’s a number of user interface design patterns that have provide successful across a range of social media apps, copied from one to another, to the extent that the largest social media apps share a similar look and feature set.

Mobile-first Provides a community for pooling money with like-minded investors Social Educational Edutainment Fun Stories section like IG / app store Common UI parts. Feed. Stories.  By using common UI parts from social media users have an easier time to accept the innovative parts. add Viz charts. Avatars are increasingly common and new generations are used to talking to computers. Karina from Korea(aespa, 2020). It makes sense your sustainability assistant would talk to you. Studies show gen N is speaking to computers all the time. Interacting with the user is on the rise. For example, Chime makes tipping suggestions on the place of purchase.

## Nudge {#nudge}

The literature on *nudge* is wide, as researches try to find ways to affect human behavious towards sustainability. Some notable examples: – Eriksson et al. (2023) – Acuti et al. (2023) – Perez-Cueto (2021) – Wee et al. (2021) – Guath et al. (2022) – Berger et al. (2022)

## Conclusion {#conclusion}

In unison, the technologies and practices reviwed above move us closer to enabling *realtime ESG*: up-do-date transparent information about how our product are produced. Realtime ESG is neccesarly a building block to enable consumers and investors make more accurate, real-world purchase decisions.
