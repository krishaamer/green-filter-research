## Students {#students}

This research focuses on developing an AI companion for ***college
students***.

### Personas {#personas}

User research makes extensive use of user ***personas*** to represent a
group of people with similar attributes. Designers use personas to
***articulate assumptions,*** which is useful for ***user-centered
design*** and also to reflect on what kind of ***biases*** might exist
in the design. Within the larger cohort of College Students several
different personas could be defined, for example grouping people by
interests, knowledge, habits, levels of anxiety, and other attributes.

There is extensive research on the attitudes of U.S. college students
towards climate change. @americanpressinstituteKnowingNewsHow2022
reports only 37% percent of U.S. Generation-Z and Millenials follow news
related to environmental issues. @schwartzClimateChangeAnxiety2022
reports some adult US students in a small study (18-35, N = 284) express
feelings of insignificance of their actions to achieve any meaningful
impact. @thomaesGreenTeensUnderstanding2023 reports U.S. adolescents
don’t find sustainability relevant to their daily life.
@rossClimateChangeChallenge2016 says most people in the U.S. don’t act
on climate change. “Action on climate change has been compromised by
uncertainty, aspects of human psychology”.

The above studies give foundation for creating a persona of a U.S.
College Student who doesn’t follow environmental news and thinks climate
action doesn’t make a difference. This doesn’t necessarily mean this
group of people with similar ideas would deny climate change is
happening. Rather “Climate Denier” could be another persona, grouping
people into a cohort who thinks climate change is not real. Further
research would be needed to define relevant personas which have
meaningful predictive and generalizing power.

| Description           | Name  | Beliefs                       |
|-----------------------|-------|-------------------------------|
| Climate Change Denier | Jake  | Climate change doesn’t exist. |
|                       | Alice |                               |
|                       | Sam   |                               |

College Student Personas

@RooneyVargaClimateActionSimulation2019 shows the effectiveness of
***The Climate Action Simulation*** in educating users about **success
scenarios**.

**Design Implications:**

-   **Show Success Scenarios!**

-   Ask how much time you want to contribute.

-   Match with other people based on time.

-   Create a group chatroom.

-   Use AI to help out with tips.

-   Ask university students what do they study and match with that
    industry to become expert and sustainability leader in this field.

-   People want to help and make a difference. Give people things to do.
    The @dontlookupMethodology part of the ***Don’t Look Up*** movie’s
    social campaign provides 5 user models / roles for the audience to
    follow: Consumer, Investor, Activist.

-   Choose Your Climate Solutions.

-   Younger people show higher motivation (participants in climate
    protests). How to be relevant for a younger audience?

-   Yet action remains low.

-   Targeted and gated to college students.

-   FB, etc, Gas all had the same launch strategy - start with students

-   @kuzminskiEcologyMoneyDebt2015 ecology of money

-   Young people are mobile-first.

-   Persona: I care mostly about… fashion, art, …

-   Young people like to follow trends.

-   Food ordering apps are popular.

-   Monoculture -\> regenerative food forests Oil -\> electric cars /
    bicycles.

-   Mobile-first.

-   Social

-   Educational

-   Edutainment

-   Fun

-   @aespaAespaEseupaMY2020: Karina from Korea. It makes sense your
    sustainability assistant would talk to you. Studies show gen N is
    speaking to computers all the time. Interacting with the user is on
    the rise. For example, Chime makes tipping suggestions on the place
    of purchase.

-   The demographics that stand to win the most from the green
    transformation of business are the youngest generations, with more
    years of life ahead of them, and more exposure to future
    environmental and social risks. It would be advisable for Generation
    Z and their parents (Millennials) to invest their resources in
    greener assets, however, it’s still difficult to pick and choose
    between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ financial vehicles to invest in.

-   This creates an opportunity for a new generation of sustainable
    investment apps, focusing on the usability and accessibility of ESG
    for a mainstream audience. Generation Z and Millennials expect a
    consumer-grade user experience.

-   What would that experience look like? I’ve chosen these demographics
    with the assumption that if given the right tools, the emotional
    demand for sustainability could be transformed into action. The
    exploration of systems of feedback to enable consumers to apply more
    direct positive and negative pressure to the businesses and
    consumers signal consequences for undesirable ecological performance
    is a major motivation of this study.

### Climate Anxiety {#climate-anxiety}

@thompsonYoungPeopleClimate2021 finds young people have climate anxiety.
@whitmarshClimateAnxietyWhat2022 shows climate anxiety is prevalent
among young people and is a possible motivator for climate action.
@ogunbodeClimateAnxietyWellbeing2022 finds climate anxiety in 32
countries and also supports the idea that climate anxiety leads to
climate activism. @hickmanClimateAnxietyChildren2021 provides more
evidence even children are anxious about climate.

-   Designing for Health and Sustainability: Health and sustainability
    are intrinsically connected. @kjaergardHealthSustainability2014
    shows how *“understanding health and sustainability as a duality,
    health both creates conditions and is conditioned by sustainability,
    understood as economic, social and environmental sustainability,
    while on the other hand sustainability creates and is conditioned by
    human health”*

-   Design for Human Rights @unfcccSharmElSheikhImplementation2023 text
    refers to “human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable
    environment”.

-   Refi podcast: “people need agency”.

-   @martiskainenContextualizingClimateJustice2020 (need access)

-   @seabrookMusicTherapyEra2020 (need access)

-   Older research on young adults (Millenials at the time) highlights
    how Millenials “use Google as a reference point for ease of use and
    simplicity” @katemoranDesigningYoungAdults2016.

***Design Implications:***

-   How to support the youth? Design to reduce climate anxiety? Is
    getting people to go to nature more a good way to increase
    ecological awareness? Empowered by Design. Youth empowerment: The
    design should empower young people.
-   Consumer branded carbon credits like angry teenagers?
-   Invest time not money, student don’t have money?

### Embodied Carbon {#embodied-carbon}

-   “embodied carbon”
-   Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance
-   @buildersforclimateactionMakingRealZero2021

### Community {#community}

Humans working together are able to achieve more than single
individuals. “Any community on the internet should be able to come
together, with capital, and work towards any shared vision. That starts
with empowering creators and artists to create and own the culture
they’re creating. In the long term this moves to internet communities
taking on societal endeavors.”

-   Building a culture of sustainability?
    @lakshmirebeccaManWhoGamifying2018;
    @armstrongCultivatingCulturesSustainability2021

***Zero Waste Lifestyle*** is the opposite of overconsumption. Zero
waste suggests people buy in bulk to save. Buying in bulk for more
savings and to reduce packaging. Through group purchases and community
investing while also reducing consumption.

***Minimalism*** is a movement of people living a simple life. This is
always going to be a small percentage of people.
@costaHowFinnishCulture2018: Finnish socialists: minimalism. Tokyo
@tokyosimpleecolifeWhatLearnedMy2021.

**Design Implications:**

-   People exist in relation to other people.

-   Psychology of ‘fundraising clubs’ vs individual investing

-   @UkraineDAOBiddingUkrainian Ukraine DAO to support Ukraine through
    web3.

-   These social movements are small and require too much effort to be
    feasible for the app? Most college students are not zero waste or
    minimalist.

-   Group Purchases.

-   Find Your Composting Community.

-   Provides a community for pooling money with like-minded investors.

### Empowerment {#empowerment}

-   I would like to have an AI agent to set my requirements and
    preferences and give a “fuck you” middle finger to companies that
    don’t meet them. I could also give a thumbs up to companies that
    meet my expectations. Perhaps the user interface could like Tinder
    where I can swipe left and right.

### Memes {#memes}

-   Coined by Richard Dawkins in 1976 in the context of biology.

-   Internet memes and meme stocks

-   Memes from daily life, bussiness to war, are relevant to penetrating
    through the noise of the web.

-   Memes and sustainability?

-   Meme research has become an academic discipline

-   Memes have become a popular communication tool..

## Data-Driven Design {#data-driven-design}

While data-driven design would usually be structured under Interaction
Design, here I will reverse the hierarchy to call attention to the fact
data is used in all these approaches to design.

Arrange types of data on a linear axis base on my own judgment.

| Lots of Data | Some Data | ??  | Little Data | No Data            |
|--------------|-----------|-----|-------------|--------------------|
|              |           |     |             | Speculative Design |

Types of design organized by use of data.

## **Design for Interaction** {#design-for-interaction}

There are many approaches to design but the majority share the common
goal of designing for a good user experience.

### Platforms & Superapps {#platforms-superapps}

The rise of the ***platform economy*** has created global marketplace
companies like Airbnb and Uber that match idle resources with retail
demand and optimize how our cities work. The massive amounts of data
generated by these companies are used by smart cities to re-design their
physical environments. With this perspective of scale, what would a
shopping experience look like if one knew at the point of sale, which
products are greener, and which are more environmentally polluting?

| Enablers of Platform Economics | Good                                                          | Bad                                                                     |
|--------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Network effects                | The more people use a platform, the more valuable it becomes. | Data is not portable. You can’t leave because you’ll lose the audience. |
| Scalability                    |                                                               |                                                                         |
| Data-driven                    |                                                               |                                                                         |
| Behaviour Design               |                                                               |                                                                         |

-   **Network Effects**: The more people use a platform, the more
    valuable it becomes. Young people are stuck inside platforms. You
    don’t own the data you put on TikTok. You can’t leave because you’ll
    lose the audience.

-   Superapps are possible thanks to **Nudge, Economies of Scale,
    Network Effects, Behaviour Design.** The most successful businesses
    today (as measured in terms of the number of users) look at the
    whole user experience. Popular consumer platforms strive to design
    solutions that feel personalized at every touchpoint on the user
    journey (to use the language of service design) but doing so at the
    scale of hundreds of millions (or even billions) of users -
    personalization at scale.

-   Superapps are honeypots of data that is used for many types of
    behavior modeling. For example @suarezEnhancingUserIncome2021
    suggests using alternative data from super-apps to estimate user
    income levels, including 4 types of data: Personal Information,
    Consumption Patterns, Payment Information, and Financial services.
    Also @roaSuperappBehavioralPatterns2021 finds super-app alternative
    data is especially useful for credit-scoring young, low-wealth
    individuals.

#### China and South-East Asia {#china-and-south-east-asia}

@giudice2020wechat argues WeChat has had a profound impact on changing
China into a cashless society, underlining how one mobile app can
transform social and financial interactions of an entire country.
@vecchiTwoTalesInternationalization2022 China is the home of many
superapps and this paper discusses the strategies taken to expand to
other markets. @shabrinanurqamaraniEFFECTSMOBILESERVICE2020 discusses
the system consistency and quality of South–East Asian superapps Gojek
and Grab.

#### Sustainability Superapps {#sustainability-superapps}

How to design sustainability superapps? Lots of options in a single app.

### Speculative Design {#speculative-design}

In order to build a better future, it’s important to be able to first
imagine a better future. Speculative design makes use of future
scenarios to envision contexts and interactions in future use. The term
***speculative design*** was invented by
@dunneSpeculativeEverythingDesign2013 in their seminal book to question
the intersection of user experience design and speculative fiction. For
example @BARENDREGT2021374 explores the potential of speculative design
to stimulate public engagement through thought experiments that spur
public debate on an issue chosen by the designer.

Phil Balagtas, founder of The Design Futures Initiative at McKinsey,
discusses the value of building future scenarios at his talk at Google
(@googledesignDesignSpeculativeFutures2019). One of his examples, the
Apple Knowledge Navigator, from an Apple vision video in 1987, took two
decades to materialize in the real world. It was inspired by a similar
device first shown in a 1970s episode of Star Trek as a **magic device**
(a term from participatory design), which then inspired subsequent
consumer product development. It took another 2 decades, until the
launch of the iPhone in 2007 - a total of 40 years. Imagination is
crucial for change.

### Quantified Self {#quantified-self}

There is a lot of research on ***quantified self***. Wearable devices
like Apple Watch, Oura Ring, combined with apps help users track a
variety of health metrics. Apart from health, wearable devices have been
used to track other metrics. @giannakosFitbitLearningCapturing2020 used
wearable devices to measured physiological parameters of students at
school to determine their learning efficiency. Could one track personal
sustainability in a similar fashion?

@shinWearableActivityTrackers2019 synthesis review of 463 studies shows
wearable devices have potential to influence behavior change towards
healthier lifestyles. @saubadePromotingPhysicalActivity2016 finds health
tracking is useful for motivating physical activity. Apple is a leader
in health tracking. @appleEmpoweringPeopleLive2022: In a 2022 report
Apple outlines its plans to : “Empowering people to live a healthier
day”. @appleWhatNewHealthKit2022 Apple’s HealthKit provides a growing
list of health metrics. @liuHowPhysicalExercise2019 tracks how wearable
data is used for tracking sleep improvements from exercise.
@grigsby-toussaintSleepAppsBehavioral2017 Sleep apps and behavioral
constructs.

Another aspect is tracking one’s mental health.
@tylerContemporarySelfreflectivePractices2022 surveys the use of
self-reflection apps in the UK (n=998).

Use technology Wearables to be more aware of one’s health.

    feedback. AI Financial Advisors will need to go further to motivate
    users. because of the nature of the technology, which is based on
    the quality of the data the systems ingest, they are prone to
    mistakes.

### Interfaces {#interfaces}

There’s a number of user interface design patterns that have provide
successful across a range of social media apps. Such ***user experience
/ user interface*** (UX/UI) patterns are copied from one app to another,
to the extent that the largest apps share a similar look and feature
set. Common UX/UI parts include the Feed and Stories. By using common UI
parts from social media users have an easier time to accept the
innovative parts. add Viz charts. Avatars are increasingly common and
new generations are used to talking to computers.

| Feature   | Examples                           |     |
|-----------|------------------------------------|-----|
| Feed      |                                    |     |
| Post      | Apple App Store                    |     |
| Stories   | IG, FB, WhatsApp, SnapChat, TikTok |     |
| Comment   |                                    |     |
| Reactions |                                    |     |

Common Social Media UI Parts

There are also more philosophical approaches to ***Interface Studies:***
@davidhoangCreatingInterfaceStudies2022, the head of product design at
Webflow, suggests taking cues from art studies to ***isolate the core
problem***. “An art study is any action done with the intention of
learning about the subject you want to draw”. As a former art student,
Hoang looks at an interface as *“a piece of design is an artwork with
function”*.

### Digital Product Design {#digital-product-design}

Design is as much about how it works as it’s about the interface.

Digital product design can be seen as a specific discipline under the
umbrella of **Experience Design**. In @michaelabrashInventingFuture2017
Meta Oculus augmented reality incubation general manager Laura Fryer:
“People buy experiences, not technology.”

Young people expect a product. Intelligent Interfaces use interaction
design to provide relevant and personalized information in the right
context and at the right time.

@ceschinEvolutionDesignSustainability2016 shows how design for
sustainability has expanded from a product focus to systems-thinking
focus placing the product inside a societal context of use. For example
@CargoBikeFREITAG, Recycled clothing maker FREITAG offers
sustainability-focused services such ass cargo bikes so you can
transport your purchases and a network for *shopping without payment* =
swapping your items with other members, as well as repairs of their
products. Loaning terminology from ***service design***, the user
journey within an app needs to consider each touchpoint on the way to a
state of success.

@weinschenk100ThingsEvery2011 says “People expect most online
interactions to follow the same social rules as person-to-person
interactions. It’s a shortcut that your brain uses to quickly evaluate
trustworthiness.”

The small screen estate space of mobiles phones and smart watches
necessitates displaying content in a dynamic manner. Virtual reality
glasses (called AR/VR or XR in marketing speak) need dynamic content
because the user is able to move around the environment. Both are
questions that interaction design is called upon to solve.
@hoangEnterDynamicIsland2022: “Dynamic interfaces might invoke a new
design language for extended reality”.

Speaking is one mode of interaction that’s become increasingly possible
as machines learn to interpret human language.

| Mode of Interaction |     |
|---------------------|-----|
| Writing             |     |
| Speaking            |     |
| Touching            |     |
| Moving              |     |
|                     |     |

Modes of interaction

Coputer

Humans respond well to ***storytelling***, making ***character design***
and ***narrative design*** relevant to interaction design. Large
language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are able to assume the
personality of any character that exists inside of its training data,
creating opportunities for automated narrative design.

(@oviyamtmRedRouteApplication2019; @InteractionDesignHow2021 and

Large Digital Platforms have a very small number of workers relative to
the number of users they serve. This creates the necessity for using
automation for both understanding user needs and providing the service
itself. Creating a good product that’s useful for the large majority of
users depends on ***Data-Driven Design.***

-   Product marketers focus on the ***stickiness*** of the product,
    meaning low attrition, meaning people keep coming back.

***Design Implications:***

-   Rebuilt the app as a personalized, narrative lifestyle feed.
-   Your shopping products mostly come from Protector and Gamble (3x)
    and Nestle. These are large conglomerates with a massive CO2
    footprint. See the index to find some alternatives.
-   How the design can connect people to sustainable outcomes while
    shopping and investing? Perhaps even forming a community of
    sustainable action. What I showed in class looks like an app but it
    could also be a physical object (a speculative design). From the
    presentations I saw most students seemed to be interested in form
    and light (many lamps) and a couple were about medical uses. I don’t
    remember seeing one that could be compatible with the environmental
    sustainability focus unfortunately…

### Narrative Design {#narrative-design}

-   The rising availability of AI assistants however may displace Google
    search with a more conversational user experience. Google itself is
    working on smarter tools to displace their own main product. The
    examples include Google Assistant, Google Bard and large investments
    into LLMs.

-   @aletheaaiAletheaAIAI2021: discusses writing AI Characters, creating
    a personality.

-   Writing as training data? large language models. GTP3.

-   Stories start with a character.

***Design Implications:***

-   Narrative design bring together film school **storytelling**

### Behavioral Design: Gamification & Nudge {#behavioral-design-gamification-nudge}

The literature on ***nudge*** is huge, as marketers and researchers try
to find ways to affect human behaviors towards making more purchase
decisions in commerce, both offline and online. First coined by the
Nobel-winning economist @thalerNudgeImprovingDecisions2009 in 2008,
nudges are based on specific understanding of human psychology and
shortcuts and triggers that human brains use and leverages that
knowledge to influence humans in small but powerful ways. The same
principles and tricks have also been applied to sustainability. For
example, a small study (n=33) in the Future Consumer Lab in Copenhagen
by @perez-cuetoNudgingPlantbasedMeals2021 found that designing a
“dish-of-the-day” which was prominently displayed helped to increase
vegetarian food choice by 85%. @GUATH2022101821 experiments (n=200)
suggested nudging can be effective in influencing online shopping
behavior towards more sustainable options. A larger scale study of
behavior change in Australia maps how to avoid “16 billion paper coffee
cups are being thrown away every year” @novoradovskayaMyCupTea2021.

Google currently offers a “Green Filter” in Google Flights and Google
maps, which allow filtering flights and driving routes by less CO2
emissions, as well as surfacing hotels with Green Key and EarthCheck
credentials, while promising new sustainability features across its
portfolio of products @sundarpichaiGivingYouMore2021. Green tools inside
Google’s online platforms are small user interface nudges which Google’s
research calls ***digital decarbonization***, defined by
@implementconsultinggroupHowDigitalSector2022 as “Maximising the
enabling role of digital technologies by accelerating already available
digital solutions”. In @katebrandtGoogleClimateAction2022, Google’s
Chief Sustainability Officer Kate Brandt set a target of “at least
20-25%” CO2 emission reductions in Europe to reach a net-zero economy
and the global announcement set a target of helping 1 billion people
make more sustainable choices around the world
(@jenimilesBecomingSustainabilityAwareApp2022). In addition to
end–users, Google offers digital decarbonizationsoftware for developers,
including the Google Cloud Carbon Footprint tool
@googleCarbonFootprint2023 and invests in regenerative agriculture
projects @GoogleRegenerativeAgriculture2021.

***Design Implications:***

-   What if there was a “Green Filter” on every product everywhere?
-   Become a Sustainability-Aware App or Game.

## Design for Sustainability {#design-for-sustainability}

Sustainability touches every facet of human existence and is thus an
enormous undertaking. Making progress on sustainability is only possible
if there’s a large-scale coordinated effort by humans around the planet.
For this to happen, some technological tools are helpful.

-   **Guided Sustainability** “refers to a concept of using technology,
    such as AI and machine learning, to help individuals and
    organizations make more sustainable decisions and take actions that
    promote environmental and social sustainability. This can include
    things like analyzing data on resource usage and emissions,
    providing recommendations for reducing the environmental impact of
    operations, or helping to identify and track progress towards
    sustainability goals. The goal of guided sustainability is to make
    it easier for people to understand their impact on the environment
    and to take steps to reduce that impact.”
-   @sanchezGreenBearLoRaWANbased2022 LoRaWAN
-   There are many examples of combination of AI and human, also known
    as “human-in-the-loop”, used for fields as diverse as training
    computer vision algorithms for self-driving cars
    @wuHumanintheLoopAIEnhancing2023 and detection of disinformation in
    social media posts:
    @bonet-joverSemiautomaticAnnotationMethodology2023. However
    @krugelAlgorithmsPartnersCrime2023 finds humans don’t necessarily
    correct mistakes made by computers and may instead become “partners
    in crime”.

Examples of human-in-the-loop apps

***Design Implications:***

-   Guidance could help young people beat climate anxiety by taking
    meaningful action.

-   The app is just as much about helping people deal with climate
    anxiety as it’s with solving the climate issue.

-   List of metrics that should be tracked to enable useful analytics.
    Ex: % of beach pollution, air pollution, water pollution (I had this
    idea while meditating). In essence, “green filter” is a central data
    repository not unlike “Apple Health for Sustainability”.

-   Health and fitness category apps

-   Using “green filter” you can get a personalized sustainability plan
    and personal coach to become healthy and nature-friendly.

-   All green categories — Green hub — Ask the user to prioritize

-   In my “green filter” AI advisor app’s scenario, the AI is scanning
    for opportunities matching the user’s sustainable investment
    appetite and risk profile, using different methods of analysis,
    including alternative data sources. Traditionally, financial
    analysts only looked at traditional data, such as company reports,
    government reports, historic performance, etc., for preparing
    advisory guidance to their clients. With the advent of AI and big
    data analysis, many other options of research data have become
    available, for example, accurate weather predictions for agriculture
    can affect guidance, because of expected future weather disasters in
    the area. Other examples include policy predictions, pollution
    metrics, etc.

-   Professional financial advisors use automated tools to analyze data
    and present it in human form to clients. Today’s ubiquitous mobile
    interfaces, however, provide the opportunity to ‘cut out the
    middleman’ and provide similar information to clients directly, at a
    lower cost and a wider scale, often without human intervention.
    Additional (more expensive) “human-judgment- as-a-service”, a
    combination of robots + human input, can help provide further
    personalized advice for the consumer, still at a cheaper price than
    a dedicated human advisor. Everyone can have a financial advisor.
