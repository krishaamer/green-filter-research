# Design for Sustainability {#design-for-sustainability}

***Designing for Sustainability*** encompasses all human activities, making this pursuit an over-arching challenge across all industries. Assuming that as individuals we want to act in a sustainable way, how exactly would be go about doing that?

-   IEA (2022) reports “Global CO2 emissions from energy combustion and industrial processes rebounded in 2021 to reach their highest ever annual level. A 6% increase from 2020 pushed emissions to 36.3 gigatonnes”
-   Crippa et al. (2022) reports latest figures from the EU’s Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR)
-   Growing public understanding of how nature works and intersects with our use of money.
-   Daniel Värjö (2022): hThe EU Copernicus satellite system reveals new greenhouse emissions previously undetected

AI can help us make sense of the vast amounts of sustainability data generated daily.

-   Gupta et al. (2023) argues software is key to building more sustainable products, already for decades. More recently, companies like AutoDesk are putting CO2 calculations inside their design software.

-   “Sustainability Starts in the Design Process, and AI Can Help” (n.d.): “Sustainability starts in the design process, and AI can help”.

-   iGenius (2020)

-   “Carbon pricing is not there to punish people.”

-   “It’s there to remind us, when we take travel, heating, consumption decisions that the true cost of fossil fuels comprises not only mining and processing, but also the damage done by the CO2 they release.”

-   Very simple.” Lion Hirth Lion Hirth (n.d.)

-   Chapman (2009) argues in his seminal paper (and later in his book) for “Emotionally Durable Design”, the simple idea that we hold to things we value and thus they are sustainable. We don’t throw away a necklace gifted to us by mom, indeed this object might be passed down for centuries. Rose (2015) has a similar idea, where “Enchanted Objects” become so interlinked with us, we’re unlikely to throw them away.

-   “Evolution of design for sustainability: From product design to design for system innovations and transitions”

## Eco-Design {#eco-design}

-   *EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities* (n.d.) report: The EU has a ***taxonomy of environmentally sustainable economic activities*** published by the Technical Expert Group (TEG) on sustainable finance .

-   Virginijus Sinkevičius, EU Commissioner for the Environment, Oceans and Fisheries, is quoted as describing eco-design “respects the boundaries of our planet” European Commission (2022b)

-   European Parliament (2022) proposal “On 30 March 2022, the European Commission put forward a proposal for a regulation establishing a general framework for setting ecodesign requirements for sustainable products, repealing rules currently in force which concentrate on energy-related products only.”

-   Manzardo et al. (2021) **(need access!)**

-   Iñarra et al. (2022) **(need access!)**

-   Munaro et al. (2022) **(need access!)**

-   Bassani et al. (2022) **(need access!)**

-   There are many domain-specific research showing how varied industries can develop eco-designed products. For example, Duriez et al. (2022) shows how simply by reducing material weight it’s possible to design more sustainable transportation.

-   Van Doorsselaer (2022) **(need access!)**

-   de Otazu et al. (2022) **Life Cycle Assessment and environmental impact analysis are needed to provide ecodesign scenarios.**

-   Nuez et al. (2022) shows how electric vehicles may increase CO2 emissions in some areas, such as Canary Islands, where electricity production is polluting.

-   Rossi et al. (2022) shows how introducing sustainability early in the design process and providing scenarios where sustainability is a metric, it’s possible to achieve more eco-friendly designs.

-   Tiernan et al. (2022) microplastics are a real concern

-   Arranz et al. (2022) developing circular economy is really complex

-   Cheba et al. (2022)

-   Ruiz-Pastor et al. (2022)

-   Miyoshi et al. (2022) takes the example of ink toner bottles and shows in a case study how standardized compatibility between older and newer systems can save resources and results in sustainability savings.

Again, AI has the potential to provide the parameters for sustainability.

-   Singh & Sarkar (2023) proposes an AI tool for deciding the suitable life cycle design parameters.

## Ecodesign for Sustainable Products {#ecodesign-for-sustainable-products}

-   Finding green products and supporting companies making them
-   Supporting legislative changes
-   Track you consumption, saving, investing. Shift balance towards saving and investing.
-   Nastaraan Vadoodi (2022)
-   European Commission (2022a) Ecodesign for sustainable products

## Climate Anxiety {#climate-anxiety}

Design to reduce climate anxiety

-   Designing for Health and Sustainability: Health and sustainability are intrinsically connected. Kjrgård et al. (2014) shows how *“By understanding health and sustainability as a duality, health both creates conditions and is conditioned by sustainability, understood as economic, social and environmental sustainability, while on the other hand sustainability creates and is conditioned by human health.”*
-   Whitmarsh et al. (2022) shows how climate anxiety is more prevalent among young people and is a possible motivator for climate action.
-   Ogunbode et al. (2022) finds climate anxiety in 32 countries and also supports the idea that climate anxiety leads to climate activism.
-   Finds that climate anxiety predicts joining climate action movements
-   How to support the youth?
-   Design for Human Rights UNFCCC Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA) (2022) text refers to “human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment”.

# Young Adults {#young-adults}

-   Is getting people to go to nature more a good way to increase ecological awareness?

## Empowering Design {#empowering-design}

-   adas

# Extended Producer Responsibility {#extended-producer-responsibility}

-   Steenmans & Ulfbeck (2023) Argues for the need to engage companies through legislation and shift from waste-centered laws to product design regulations.

-   Peng et al. (2023) finds that the Carbon Disclosure Project has been a crucial tool to empower ERP in Chinese auto-producers.

-   K. Liu et al. (2023) reports, e–waste is growing 3%–5% every year, globally. Thukral & Singh (2023) identifies several barriers to e-waste management among producers including lack of awareness and infrastructure, attitudinal barriers, existing *informal* e-waste sector, and the need for an e-waste license.

-   In Europe, there’s large variance between member states when in comes to textile recycling: while Estonia and France are the only EU countries where separate collection of textiles is required by law, in Estonia 100% of the textiles were burned in an incinerator in 2018 while in France textiles are covered by an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme leading to higher recovery rates (Ibid).

-   Christiansen et al. (2021): Nonetheless, EPR schemes do not guarantee circularity and may instead be designed around fees to finance waste management in linear economy models.

-   Jacques Vernier (2021): French EPR scheme was upgraded in 2020 to become more circular.

-   In any case, strong consumer legislation (such as EPR) has a direct influence on producers’ actions. For example, in HKTDC Research (2022)@, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council notified textile producers in July 2022 reminding factories to produce to French standards in order to be able enter the EU market.

***Design implications:** ERP and CDP data should be part of Green Filter.*

## Designing for Sustainable Shopping {#designing-for-sustainable-shopping}

-   Weber (2021) proposes a sustainable shopping guide.
-   Fuentes et al. (2019) discusses package free shopping.
-   van der Wal et al. (2016) discusses “status motives make people publicly display sustainable behavior”.

### Food Waste {#food-waste}

-   Nabipour Afrouzi et al. (2023): “The agricultural sector contributes to approximately 13.5% of the total global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and accounts for 25% of the total CO2 emission.”

There are several initiatives to reduce food waste by helping people consume food that would otherwise be throw away.

-   Poore & Nemecek (2018) suggests 26% of carbon emissions come from food production. Saner et al. (2015) reports dairy (46%) and meat and fish (29%) products making up the largest GHG emission potential. Springmann et al. (2021) proposes veganism is the most effective decision to reduce personal CO2 emissions.

-   Röös et al. (2023) identified 5 perspectives in a small study (*n=106*) of views on the Swedish food system:

| Perspective                         | Content                                                                               |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| *“The diagnostic perspective”*      | “*All hands on deck to fix the climate”*                                              |

| “The hands-on perspective”          | “Tangible solutions within the reach of consumers and the food industry”              |

-   ***Design Implication***: Where to shop rankings for groceries — list worst offenders in terms of products — shop and invest according to your values.

-   Kommenda et al. (2022) Carbon Food Labels

-   Food Sovereignty: “The global food sovereignty movement, which had been building momentum since its grassroots conception in the late ’90s, quickly gained traction with its focus on the rights of people everywhere to access healthy and sustainable food. One of the pillars of the movement lies in using local food systems to reduce the distance between producers and consumers.”

-   CAITLIN STALL-PAQUET (2021): “We can grow foods just as well in the inner city as we can out in the country because we’re agnostic to arable land,” says Woods. “Because we grow indoors and create our own weather, \[climate change\] doesn’t affect our produce.”

## Fast Fashion, Sustainable Fashion, Textile Design {#fast-fashion-sustainable-fashion-textile-design}

Across industries, reports are saying there isn’t enough transparency.

-   In European Environment Agency (2022), European Environment Agency (EEA) estimates based on trade and production data that EU27 citizens consumed an average 15kg of textile products per person per year. Köhler et al. (2021): Globally 87% of textile products are burned or landfilled after 1st consumer use.

-   Marrucci et al. (2020) Italian retail supermarkets carbon footprint?

-   Leung & Luximon (2021) There’s a growing know-how on how to produce sustainably and which materials to use. “Handbook of Footwear Design and Manufacture” Chapter 18 - Green design.

-   Kolko & Connors (2010); IxDF (n.d.) believes interaction design is still an emerging (and changing) field and there are many definitions. I prefer the simplest version: interaction design is about creating a conversation between the product and the user.
-   Weinschenk (2011) says “People expect most online interactions to follow the same social rules as person-to-person interactions. It’s a shortcut that your brain uses to quickly evaluate trustworthiness.”
-   Richard Yang (2021) and Justin Baker (2018) say some of the tools used by interaction designers include

## Quantified Self {#quantified-self}

There is a lot of research on quantified self. the Wearable devices like Apple Watch, Oura Ring and apps help users track a variety of health metrics. Can we also track personal sustainability in a similar fashion?

-   Delclòs-Alió et al. (2022) discusses walking in Latin American cities. Walkin is the most sustainable method or transport but requires the availability of city infrastructure, such as sidewalks, which many cities still lack.
-   Giannakos et al. (2020) used wearable devices to measured physiological parameters of students at school to determine their learning efficiency.

## Supply Chains {#supply-chains}

-   Several startups are using distributed ledgers (blockchains) to track source material to the factories ad product movements from factories to markets. While blockchains enable securely tracing data, which is immutable (no possible to change the same record, only update data in new records), the system still relies on correct data input. As the saying goes, “garbage in, garbage out”. Indeed, the blockchain is most useful for auditing, as the time and place of data input can be guaranteed, it will be easier to conduct a search on who inputted incorrect data.

-   The blockchain supply chain companies as of summer 2023 include:

| Company        | Link                       |
|----------------|----------------------------|
| Ocean Protocol | https://oceanprotocol.com/ |
| Provenance     | https://www.provenance.io/ |
| Ambrosius      | https://ambrosus.io/       |
| Modum          | https://www.modum.io/      |

| FairFood       | https://fairfood.org/      |
| Bext360        | https://www.bext360.com/   |

-   Another aspect of supply tracing is the treatment of workers and working conditions. Companies that intend to 2give supply chain a voice” by connecting workers directly to the consumer (even in anonymously, to protect the workers from retribution), include *CTMFile* and *Alexandria*.

### Interface Studies {#interface-studies}

-   David Hoang (2022), the head of product design at Webflow, suggests taking cues from art studies to ***isolate the core problem***. “An art study is any action done with the intention of learning about the subject you want to draw”. As a former art student, Hoang looks at an interface as *“a piece of design is an artwork with function”*.

### Speculative Design {#speculative-design}

-   Dunne & Raby (2013) invented the term *‘speculative design’* in their seminal book as the question on the intersection of user experience design and speculation. Speculative design makes use of future scenarios to envision contexts and interactions in future use. Phil Balagtas, founder of The Design Futures Initiative at McKinsey, discusses the value of building future scenarios at his talk at Google (Google Design, 2019). One of his examples, the Apple Knowledge Navigator, from an Apple vision video in 1987, took two decades to materialize in the real world, inspired by a similar device first shown in a 1970s episode of Star Trek as a magic device (a term from participatory design), which then inspired subsequent consumer product development - and then another 2 decades, until the launch of the iPhone in 2007 - a total of 40 years!

-   In my “green filter” AI advisor app’s scenario, the AI is scanning for opportunities matching the user’s sustainable investment appetite and risk profile, using different methods of analysis, including alternative data sources. Traditionally, financial analysts only looked at traditional data, such as company reports, government reports, historic performance, etc., for preparing advisory guidance to their clients. With the advent of AI and big data analysis, many other options of research data have become available, for example, accurate weather predictions for agriculture can affect guidance, because of expected future weather disasters in the area. Other examples include policy predictions, pollution metrics, etc.

-   Professional financial advisors use automated tools to analyze data and present it in human form to clients. Today’s ubiquitous mobile interfaces, however, provide the opportunity to ‘cut out the middleman’ and provide similar information to clients directly, at a lower cost and a wider scale, often without human intervention. Additional (more expensive) “human-judgment- as-a-service”, a combination of robots + human input, can help provide further personalized advice for the consumer, still at a cheaper price than a dedicated human advisor. Everyone can have a financial advisor.

#### “Speculative Design” for a sustainability assistant {#speculative-design-for-a-sustainability-assistant}

-   Barendregt & Vaage (2021) explores the potential of speculative design to stimulate public engagement through thought experiments that spur public debate on an issue chosen by the designer.
-   (**cgoogledesignDesignSpeculativeFutures2019?**)
-   All green categories — Green hub — Ask the user to prioritize

### Experience Design {#experience-design}

-   In Michael Abrash (2017) Meta Oculus AR Incubation GM Laura Fryer: “People buy experiences, not technology.”
-   Loaning terminology from service design, the user journey within an app needs to consider about touchpoint on the way to a state of success.

### Mobile App Design {#mobile-app-design}

There’s a number of user interface design patterns that have provide successful across a range of social media apps, copied from one to another, to the extent that the largest social media apps share a similar look and feature set.

-   Mobile-first

-   Provides a community for pooling money with like-minded investors

-   Social

-   Educational

-   Edutainment

-   Fun

-   Stories section like IG / app store

-   Common UI parts. Feed. Stories.  By using common UI parts from social media users have an easier time to accept the innovative parts. add Viz charts. Avatars are increasingly common and new generations are used to talking to computers.

-   aespa (2020): Karina from Korea. It makes sense your sustainability assistant would talk to you. Studies show gen N is speaking to computers all the time. Interacting with the user is on the rise. For example, Chime makes tipping suggestions on the place of purchase.

### Carbon Labelling {#carbon-labelling}

-   Adam Corner (2012): Adding CO2 labels for consumer products have been discussed for decades.
-   While academic literature has looked at even minute detail such as color and positioning of the label (Zhou et al. (2019)) and there is some indication consumers are willing to pay a small premium for low-CO2 products (Xu & Lin (2022)) as well as all else being equal, choose the option with a lower CO2 number (Carlsson et al. (2022)), the idea of *Carbon Labelling* is yet to find mainstream adoption.
-   Although there’s some evidence to suggest labeling low CO2 food enables people to choose a *climatarian diet* in a large-scale study Lohmann et al. (2022) of UK university students, their impact on the market share of low-carbon meals is negible.
-   Asioli et al. (2022) found differences between countries, where Spanish and British consumers chose meat products with *‘No antibiotics ever’* over a *Carbon Trust* label, whereas French consumers chose CO2 labeled meat products.
-   Labels alone are not enough, as underlined by Edenbrandt & Lagerkvist (2022) in Sweden in a study which found a negative correlation between worrying about climate impact and interest in climate information on products, suggesting a need for wider environmental education programs.

### The Concept of ‘Nudge’ {#the-concept-of-nudge}

-   The literature on *nudge* is wide, as researches try to find ways to affect human behaviors towards sustainability. Some notable examples:
-   Wee et al. (2021) proposes 7 types of nudging technique based on an overview of 37 papers in the field.

| Name              | Technique                                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Prompting         | Create cues and reminders to perform a certain behavior                                   |
| Sizing            | Decrease or increase the size of items or portions                                        |
| Proximity         | Change the physical (or temporal) distance of options                                     |
| Presentation      | Change the way items are displayed                                                        |
| Priming           | Expose users to certain stimuli before decision-making                                    |
| Labelling         | Provide labels to influence choice (for example CO2 footprint labels)                     |
| Functional Design | Design the environment and choice architecture so the desired behavior is more convenient |

-   Eriksson et al. (2023) discusses best practices for reducing food waste in Sweden.
-   Acuti et al. (2023) makes the point that physical proximity to a drop-off point helps people participate in sustainability.
-   A small study (n = 33) Perez-Cueto (2021) in the Future Consumer Lab in Copenhagen found that designing a “dish-of-the-day” which was prominently displayed helped to increase vegetarian food choice by 85%.
-   Guath et al. (2022) experiments (n=200) suggested nudging can be effective in influencing online shopping behavior towards more sustainable options.
-   Berger et al. (2022) **(Need access!)**
-   Google and X have offered the “Green Filter” on Maps, Flights, etc. What if there was a “Green Filter” on every product everywhere?

``` mdx-code-block
<Figure caption="Google's view of flight emissions" src={FlightEmissions} refURL="https://www.google.com/travel/flights" refTitle="Copyright by Google 2023 referenced under fair use" />
```

-   One example of *nudge* are the small UI updates released by Google across its portfolio of products: Google Flights and Google maps. Google’s research introduces the concept of *digital decarbonization*, which Implement Consulting Group (2022) defines as “Maximising the enabling role of digital technologies by accelerating already available digital solutions”.
-   In Kate Brandt & Matt Brittin (2022), Google’s Chief Sustainability Officer Kate Brandt suggests “Digital solutions play an important enabling role for at least 20-25% of the reductions required to achieve a net-zero economy in Europe”.

| №   | Product        | Nudge                                |
|-----|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1   | Google Maps    | Show routes with lower CO2 emissions |
| 2   | Google Flights | Show CO2 emissions                   |

-   Becoming a Sustainability-Aware App or Game.

-   Jeni Miles (2022) suggests “Google recently shared its goal to help one billion people make more sustainable choices by embedding carbon emissions information into Google Flights and surfacing whether a hotel is Green Key or EarthCheck certified.”

-   Playing for the Planet Alliance (2021)

### Social Objects {#social-objects}

-   Sharing.Lab (2015): I’m interested in the concept of a “social object”.

-   How the design can connect people to sustainable outcomes while shopping and investing? Perhaps even forming a community of sustainable action. What I showed in class looks like an app but it could also be a physical object (a speculative design). From the presentations I saw most students seemed to be interested in form and light (many lamps) and a couple were about medical uses. I don’t remember seeing one that could be compatible with the environmental sustainability focus unfortunately…

-   What percent of all design is “sustainable design” ? Promoting sustainable design.

### Sustainability Superapp {#sustainability-superapp}

-   How to design superapps? Lots of options in a single app.

-   “Will Europe Get a Superapp, and Who Will It Be?” (2022)

-   WeChat

-   Adaptive AI

-   Vecchi & Brennan (2022) China is the home of many superapps and this paper discusses the strategies taken to expand to other markets.

-   Shabrina Nurqamarani et al. (2020) discusses the system consistency and quality of South–East Asian superapps Gojek and Grab.

-   Zeng (2015) **(need to pay for article!)**

-   Huang & Miao (2021) **(need to pay for article!)**

-   G. Suarez et al. (2021) suggests using alternative data from super-apps to estimate user income levels, including 4 types of data: Personal Information, Consumption Patterns, Payment Information, and Financial services.

-   Roa et al. (2021) finds super-app alternative data is especially useful for credit-scoring young, low-wealth individuals.

-   Giudice (2020) MA thesis’s argues WeChat has had a profound impact on changing China into a cashless society, underlining how one mobile app can transform social and financial interactions of an entire country.
