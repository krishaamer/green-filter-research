## Synthesise: {#synthesise}

Your shopping products mostly come from Protector and Gamble (3x) and Nestle. These are large conglemerates with a massive CO2 footprint. See the index to find some alternatives.

“design is a tool to make complexity comprehensible” like the helsinki chapel. there’s either or a priest or a social worker. it’s the perfect public service. “limit the barrier of entry for people to discover”. elegant.

“On 30 March 2022, the European Commission put forward a proposal for a regulation establishing a general framework for setting ecodesign requirements for sustainable products, repealing rules currently in force which concentrate on energy-related products only.”

## Social Object {#social-object}

I’m interested in the concept of a “social object” https://medium.com/we-research-and-expriment-with-how-the-sharing/what-is-a-social-object-8dd52df0f15c and how the design can connect people to sustainable outcomes while shopping and investing. Perhaps even forming a community of sustainable action. What I showed in class looks like an app but it could also be a physical object (a speculative design). From the presentations I saw most students seemed to be interested in form and light (many lamps) and a couple were about medical uses. I don’t remember seeing one that could be compatible with the environmental sustainabilty focus unfortunately…

## Health {#health}

-   health and sustainability: “By understanding health and sustainability as a duality, health both creates conditions and is conditioned by sustainability, understood as economic, social and environmental sustainability, while on the other hand sustainability creates and is conditioned by human health.”

Google and X have offered the “Green Filter” on Maps, Flightss, etc. What if tthere was a “Green Filter” on every product everywhere?

“Speculative Design” for a sustainbility assistant

Neri oxman, biomaterials mit media lab , 15. sept. 2020 — neri oxman expressions: “ecology-indifferent” “naturing”“mother naturing” “design is a practice of letting go of all that is unneccesary” “nature should be our single client”

speculative design use imagination

societal movements change things: implivmcatuon for design, build a community

-   “People buy experiences, not technology.”

— Loaning terminology from service design, the user journey within an app needs to consider about touchpoint on the way to a state of success.

Mobile App Design There’s a number of user interface design patterns that have provide successful across a range of social media apps, copied from one to another, to the extent that the largest social media apps share a similar look and feature set.

Stories.  By using common UI parts from social media users have an easier time to accept the innovative parts. add Viz charts. Avatars are increasingly common and new generations are used to talking to computers. Karina from Korea(aespa, 2020). It makes sense your sustainability assistant would talk to you. Studies show gen N is speaking to computers all the time. Interacting with the user is on the rise. For example, Chime makes tipping suggestions on the place of purchase.
