        "This chapter explores the growing trend of financial democratization, which includes consumer apps that enable new user interactions which increasingly blur boundaries between shopping, saving, and investing - termed here *\"money convergence\"*. The efforts to boost user numbers have driven apps that started out with only payments-focused businesses - such as Revolut and N26 - branch out into offering savings accounts and investing options.\n",
        "\n",
        "While the journey from consumer to investor is increasingly simple because of the *democratization of finance*, the critical question is: do people choose to support sustainability-focused companies - companies which invest deeply into green innovation and eco-friendly practices - or do people choose companies that pay less attention to sustainability?\n",
        "\n",
        "Shopping, saving, and investing are converging on digital platforms (super-apps) that permeate our daily financial lives, with features such basic banking, payments, transfers, as well as reward and cashback programs (Rakuten), round-up to next dollar with automated micro-investing (e.g. Acorn, Stash, Swedbank), and retail investing (Robinhood, Public) and copy-trading (eToro) into various (fractional shares of) stocks, derivatives like CFDs and futures, microloans (Kiva), commodities and precious metals such as gold and silver (Revolut), physical assets such as real estate, land, forest and digital assets such as cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and other alternative assets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Consumers are beginning to become more money-savvy yet are still missing many key concepts from financial literacy. Giving users exposure to investment opportunities through familiar activities like shopping may have the potential to boost financial literacy levels and entice consumers to learn more about taking advantage of their opportunities financial markets - as well as how to manage the types or risk involved.\n",

And we also have new types of money created by companies and individuals using cryptographic blockchain-based distributed databases, which keep track of transactions (who-paid-whom). Whatever the method of creation, in essence, money is a *system of trust* where *something* is used as a *medium of value exchange* and accepted by *other people* as payment. Digital money in it's various forms connects industries on the same apps, which make investing more accessible and socially engaging, appealing to younger people who are active in social media and online shopping.\n",

Empowering consumers to access finance through digital technologies and delivering a simple UX (user experience) – i.e. the fintech trend of the last 2 decades -, includes financial products creating pathways towards sustainability-focused investing. Sustainable capital allocation methods are many.
