#### *Design Implications:*

-   App shows traceability.

-   Help consumers to demand more.

#### Supply Chains

-   @finkenstadtBlurryVisionSupply2021 COVID19 pandemic highlighted the need to have real-time visibility into supply chains.

Circular design is possible if supply chains become circular.

-   @wagenvoortSelfdrivingSupplyChains2020 Self-driving supply chains.. (contact japanese factory?)

-   California Transparency in Supply Chains Act

-   @knightFutureBusinessRole2022 new tools are needed to map supply chains.

-   @duttaBlockchainTechnologySupply2020 hundreds of paper researching blockchain use in supply change operations since 2017.

-   @vanwassenaerTokenizingCircularityAgrifood2023 Compares use cases for blockchains in enhancing traceability, transparency and cleaning up the supply chain. There are several technologies for tracking goods across the supply chain, from shipping to client delivery.

-   @ashrafPrototypeSupplyChain2023 Solana blockchain and Sigfox internet of things (IoT) Integration for supply chain traceability.

-   Several startups are using distributed ledgers (blockchains) to track source material arriving to the factories and product movements from factories to markets. While blockchains enable securely tracing data, which is immutable (no possible to change the same record, only add data in new records).

-   Blockchain ledgers are useful for data sharing and auditing, as the time and place of data input can be guaranteed, and it will be easier to conduct a search on who inputted incorrect data, however the system still relies on correct data input. As the saying goes, "garbage in, garbage out".

: Blockchain supply chain companies as of summer 2023 include.

-   Traceability and animal rights. Animal rights vs animal welfare. Ethereum blockchain and animal rights. "Blockchain can provide a transparent, immutable record of the provenance of products. This can be especially useful for verifying claims made about animal welfare. For example, products claiming to be"free-range," "organic," or "sustainably sourced" could have their entire lifecycle recorded on the blockchain, from birth to shelf, allowing consumers to verify these claims."

<!-- -->

-   Another aspect of supply tracing is the treatment of workers and working conditions. Companies that intend to 2give supply chain a voice" by connecting workers directly to the consumer (even in anonymously, to protect the workers from retribution), include *CTMFile* and *Alexandria*.

#### Oracles for Sustainability Data

Intersection with finance and Real World Data.

A data oracle is the concept of a source of real-world data which can be ingested through an application programming interface (API) by, for example, a blockchain system. There are many databases of sustainability information which could serve as an oracle for "green filter", including carbon labeling, packaging, transportation, consumption, and waste.

-   @ethereumOracles2023

-   @caldarelliOvercomingBlockchainOracle2020 notes it's a challenge to ensure the accuracy and trustworthiness of real-world data from Oracles.

-   @bradydaleChainlinkFounderSays2021 and @chainlinkNewReportBlockchains2022: The largest Oracle provider ChainLink founder Sergey Nazarov believes the collaboration of oracles and blockchains can make carbon credits more trustworthy.

#### Ethics & Cruelty

Can data transparency provide tools for reducing cruelty.

-   Cruelty free brands
-   BCorp
-   ESG
-   Trash found in ocean / nature etc
-   Increase your investment point by matching with your contribution /.
-   Point of Sales integration (know the SKU you buy). Integrate to the financial eco footprint (no need to scan the product). What's the name of the startup that does this?
-   Precision Fermentation and Cultivated Meat: Meat products without farm animals

#### *Design Implications:*

-   Rank companies based on sustainability

-   Help you to decide: what to buy, how to save, where to invest

#### *Design Implications:*

-   Make open data easy to use in everyday life.

-   The key idea is making CO2 Visible.

#### Emissions

Data about green house gas emissions.

@crippaCO2EmissionsAll2022 shows average global emissions are 4.81 tonnes of CO2 per capita.

| Per Capita (2020)    | Total (2021)   |

: @worldresourcesinstituteCO2EmissionsMetric2020 shows the top 5 largest per capita CO2 emissions come from Oil Producers. Total CO2 emissions from @europeancommission.jointresearchcentre.CO2EmissionsAll2022.

@ivanovaQuantifyingPotentialClimate2020 shows the average per capita carbon footprint of North America 13.4, Europe 7.5, Africa and the Middle East 1.7 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per capita.

#### Carbon Labels

Adding CO2 labels for consumer products have been discussed for decades (@adamcornerWhyWeNeed2012). @cohenPotentialRoleCarbon2012 argues carbon labels do influence consumer choice towards sustainability. Academic literature has looked at even minute detail such as color and positioning of the label (@zhouCarbonLabelsHorizontal2019). There is some indication consumers are willing to pay a small premium for low-CO2 products (@xuLowcarbonEconomyCarbon2022). All else being equal, consumers choose the option with a lower CO2 number (@carlssonSustainableFoodCan2022). Nonetheless, the idea of *Carbon Labelling* is yet to find mainstream adoption.

There's some evidence to suggest labeling low CO2 food enables people to choose a *climatarian diet* in a large-scale study @lohmannCarbonFootprintLabels2022 of UK university students, however the impact of carbon labels on the market share of low-carbon meals is negligible. Labels alone are not enough. underlines @edenbrandtConsumerPerceptionsAttitudes2022 in Sweden in a study which found a negative correlation between worrying about climate impact and interest in climate information on products, suggesting a need for wider environmental education programs. @asioliConsumersValuationCultured2022 found differences between countries, where Spanish and British consumers chose meat products with *'No antibiotics ever'* over a *Carbon Trust* label, whereas French consumers chose CO2 labeled meat products.

@briankatemanCarbonLabelsAre2020: Carbon labeling is voluntary and practiced by only a handful of companies. The U.S. restaurant chain *Just Salad* , U.K.-based vegan meat-alternative *Quorn* and plant milk *Oatly* provide carbon labeling on their products. @climatepartnerLabellingCarbonFootprint2020: Companies like ClimatePartner and Carbon Calories offers labeling consumer goods with emission data as a service. @thecarbontrustHowReduceYour: The Carbon Trust reports it's certified 27 thousand product footprints.

-   Digitalisation @DigitalReceiptsCustomer Digital Receipts to be able to track your carbon footprint

-   @ivanovaQuantifyingPotentialClimate2020 "establish consumption options with a high mitigation potential measured in tons of CO2 equivalent per capita per year."

-   55% of emissions come from energy production.

-   @cartoClimateResilienceGeography2023 Making advanced maps to convince people to make changes

#### Digital Product Passports

It's a further development of the idea of carbon labels.

-   @nissinenMakeCarbonFootprints2022 reports The European Commision has proposed a *Digital Product Passports* to help companies transfer environmental data. Carbon labels are needed for green transformation.

-   @reichDefiningGoalsProduct2023 "Information gaps are identified as one of the major obstacles to realizing a circular economy."

-   @jensenDigitalProductPassports2023 "support decision-making throughout product life cycles in favor of a circular economy."

-   @kingProposedUniversalDefinition2023 "influence consumer behavior towards sustainable purchasing and responsible product ownership by making apparent sustainability aspects of a product life cycle."x m

-   @bergerConfidentialitypreservingDataExchange2023 "support Sustainable Product Management by gathering and containing product life cycle data. However, some life cycle data are considered sensitive by stakeholders, leading to a reluctance to share such data."

-   @talebAntifragileThingsThat2012 antifragile systems that get better in difficult situations

## Industry Cases

Conversations about sustainability are too general and one needs to look at the specific sustainability metrics at specific industries to be able to design for meaningful interaction.

-   There are many domain-specific research showing how varied industries can develop eco-designed products. For example, @DURIEZ2022454 shows how simply by reducing material weight it's possible to design more sustainable transportation.

#### *Design Implications:*

-   Focus on specific industries.

### Construction

-   @zhaoEmbodiedCarbonBased2015 super tall buildings are very CO2 intensive
-   embodied carbon
-   @oikosdenktankWebinarDoughnutEconomics2021 circular material procurement requires new skills. How to reuse old paint? Small projects can have large social impact.

### Fashion

Sustainable Fashion, Textile Design

@YoungConsumersComplicated: Young people are the largest consumers of fast fashion. In @europeanenvironmentagencyTextilesEnvironmentRole2022, European Environment Agency (EEA) estimates based on trade and production data that EU27 citizens consumed an average 15kg of textile products per person per year.

-   @millward-hopkinsMaterialFlowAnalysis2023 shows how half of the textile waste in the UK is exported to other countries.

-   Story of Patagonia @chouinardLetMyPeople2005

Across industries, reports are saying there isn't enough transparency.

-   [@hannahritchieSectorSectorWhere2020 @usepaGlobalGreenhouseGas2016] GHG emission inventory by sector

-   **Problem**: @emilychanWeStillDon2022 report says there's not enough transparency in fashion:
