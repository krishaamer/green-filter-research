## The Convergence of Money

### Democratization of Finance as a Precursor to Sustainability

This chapter explores how money could incorporate sustainability as a feature.

> “Money is information… it shouldn’t be more expensive or slower than sending an email.” (K. Käärmann, Co-Founder of the Wise , formerly known as Transferwise, money transfer platform), said in 2018 [@kaarmannWhyDoesTransferWise2018]

*Money* itself is changing and the meaning of money is becoming more diverse. Traditionally money referred to the fiat money created by governments by law, using central banks, which loan money to commercial banks, that in turn make it available to the society. We also have new types of money created by companies and individuals using blockchain-cryptography based distributed databases, which keep track of transactions (who-paid-whom). We have various types of tokens of value, which are all types of money. Whatever the method of creation, in essence, money is a *system of trust* where *something* is used as a *medium of value exchange* and accepted by *other people* as payment.

Digital money in it's various forms connects industries on popular financial mobile apps, which make money more accessible and socially engaging, appealing to people who are active online. Consumer-oriented financial apps increasingly enable new user interactions which blur boundaries between shopping, saving, and investing - termed here *"money convergence"*. Empowering consumers to access finance through digital technologies and delivering a simple user experience is the fintech trend of the last decade. More recently, motivated by boosting user numbers, apps such as Revolut and N26, that started out with only payments-focused businesses, begun making efforts to become all-in-one financial superapps offering saving and investing services.

The journey from consumer to investor is increasingly simple because of the *democratization of finance.* While consumers are beginning to become more money-savvy, they still lack many key concepts from financial literacy. Giving users exposure to investment opportunities through familiar activities like shopping may hold the potential to boost financial literacy levels, enticing consumers to learn more about taking advantage of their financial opportunities as well as understanding how to manage the types or risk involved.

Financial superapps shopping, saving, and investing are converging on digital platforms, aiming to permeate our daily financial lives, with features such banking, payments, transfers, rewards and cashback programs (e.g. Rakuten), automated micro-investing round-up to next dollar (e.g. Acorn, Stash, Swedbank, many others), retail investing (Robinhood, Public, Lightyear), copy-trading (eToro) and offering various investment vehicles, to name just a few: (fractional shares of) stocks, derivatives like CFDs and futures, microloans (Kiva), commodities and precious metals such as gold and silver (Revolut), physical assets such as real estate, land, forest and digital assets such as cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and many other alternative assets of varied price, volatility, liquidity, and risk profile.

### Helping Consumers Allocate Capital to Sustainability

Regardless if it's money spent on shopping or money saved and invested, these are all consumers' financial decisions of *capital allocation*. In one way or another, people are giving their money to companies. The critical question is: *do people choose to support sustainability-focused companies* - companies which invest deeply into green innovation and eco-friendly practices - or do people choose companies that pay less attention to sustainability? While all financial transactions support economic growth in the sense of being reflected in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), not all money flows equally support sustainable economic growth.

Sustainable capital allocation methods are many. The extent to which this funnel works - and it's indeed a complex, multi–step funnel - depends on curbing greenwashing to a level that allows consumers to distinguish eco–friendly businesses from the heavy polluters.

, Can the democratization of various uses of money include sustainability as a feature?

-, includes financial products creating pathways towards sustainability-focused investing.

ESG (Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance)

Trend of sustainably, how can sustainability become more accessible? People want to shop, save, and invest sustainably - how to do it?

Fintechs can growth fast; Neo Financial, which offers a mobile app and credit cards to consumers featuring cashback rewards on payments, savings and investing, in Canada, won Canada's fastest growing company award in 2024, posting a 3-year revenue growth of 38,431% earning between \$75M and \$100M USD in annual revenue from 1.3 million customers [@RankingCanadasTop2024].

### The New Rules of Money: Evolving Financial Legislation From ESG to MiFID II

Legislation is Catching Up With Fintechs. Legislation sets higher standards.

Directive 14 2014/65/EU, 2014: The European Union fully recognizes the changing financial landscape trending towards the democratization of investments: *"more investors have become active in the financial markets and are offered an even more complex wide-ranging set of services and instruments"* [@europeanparliamentDirective2014652014]. Some key legislation for investors has been put in place recently, for example "MiFID II is a legislative framework instituted by the European Union (EU) to regulate financial markets in the bloc and improve protections for investors" [@kentonMiFIDII2020]. MiFID II and MiFIR will ensure fairer, safer and more efficient markets and facilitate greater transparency for all participants" [@europeansecuritiesandmarketsauthorityMiFIDII2017].

Already in 2001, while still part of the EU, the UK government was discussing ways to promote sustainable investment *"fundamental changes in VAT or corporation taxes could be used to promote greener consumption and investment"* [@houseofcommonsEnvironmentalAuditSecond2002]. More recently, [@hmtreasuryChancellorSetsOut2020] released a taxonomy of sustainable activities in the UK.

Campain to ban polluting products campaign success story, EU shops can't sell deforestation products gathered over 100 thousand online signatures [@wemoveeuropeBanForestkillingProducts2022]. Legislation banning products contributing to deforestation was passed by the EU Parliament and Council in 2023 and came into effect in July 2024 [@europeanparliamentRegulationEU20232023; @abnettUnitedStatesAsks2024].

While the above trend is for governments to adapt to and work towards their environmental climate commitments and public demand, the sovereign risk remains an issue. For example, in the U.S. the policies supported by President Donald Trump during his presidency ran counter to many sustainability recommendations, including those directed at the financial markets, helping legacy industries stay competitive for longer through subsidies, and lack of regulation, or even regulation supporting legacy technologies [@quinsonTrumpPlanBlock2020].

[@pwc2022GrowthOpportunity2020] Changes to laws and regulations aimed at achieving climate change mitigation is a key driver behind the wave of ESG adoption. The goal of these laws, first adopted in the European Union, a self-proclaimed leader in eco-friendliness, is to pressure unsustainable companies to change towards greener practices, in fear of losing their access to future capital, and to create a mechanism forcing entire environmentally non-compliant business sectors to innovate towards sustainability unless they want to suffer from financial penalties. On the flip side of this stick and carrot fiscal strategy, ESG-compliant companies will have incentives to access to cheaper capital and larger investor demand from ESG-friendly investors.

#### Shopping Environmental Footprint Driven by Social Commerce

Online Shopping impact. Single's day, etc.

Double Eleven 11/11 celebrated on November 11 is the world's largest shopping festival [@double11festival2023]. In June 2023, 526 million people watch e-commerce live-streams in China; online bargaining is a type of ritual [@liuBargainingChineseLivestream2024]. According to [@iginiEnvironmentalImpactOnline2024] "Asia is set to account for 50% of the world's total online retail sales".

It may seem impossible to turn the tide of consumerism, given the projected growth in online shopping [@forresterForresterGlobalOnline2024]

#### Shopping Driven by AI Assistants

important - more and more consumers using AI assistants to find alternative products, make shopping lists, etc @pandyaAdobeAnalyticsTraffic2025; @pastoreMoreConsumersUsing2025; @neuronGetReadyYour2025

#### Consumer Activism

*Conscious consumers* make up a small percentage of the entire consumer public. [@milneMindfulConsumptionThree2020] coins the term *mindful consumers*, who do research and are aware of the impact of their shopping choices.

-   Consume pressure to advance ESG regulatory standards to add a baseline ESG dynamic pricing of risk like climate, mandatory climate disclosures, carbon pricing knowing your supply chain, analyze supply chain risk

-   Is Sustainable Shopping possible? "Learn to notice so we can preserve", "Õpetame märkama, et oskaksime hoida". "Consumers have increasing power. Where we put our money reinforces certain types of businesses, as conscious consumers we can vote with our dollars. How can we do it？ Sustainable brands, ESG, etc, etc. Pushing highers Standards and choose companies that adopt circular design" What is the consumer CO~2~ contribution? What is the target?

sustainable consumption relationships in Europe.

-   Sustainable Consumerism via Self-Regulation. 2M EUR project for the shopping app. [@klinglmayrSustainableConsumerismSelfRegulation2016]

Make use of indexes to compare companies.

-   @weberMobileAppsSustainable2021 proposes a sustainable shopping guide.
-   @fuentesUnpackingPackageFree2019 discusses package free shopping.
-   @vanderwalParadoxGreenBe2016 discusses "status motives make people publicly display sustainable behavior".

For consumer activism to become mainstream it needs to much simpler.

#### Payments

Banks and Fintechs Capture User Data. Payments are an Entry Point and Source of Consumer Action Data, Shopping Data. Payments is the primary way consumers use money. Is there a funnel From Payments to Investing? ESG Shopping is about Changing our relationship with money. Make commerce more transparent. Current shopping is like having a one-night stand. you barely know the name of your company. You don't know much about their background. Building consumer feeling of ownership, create meaningful connections between producers and consumers.

Payments is one way consumers can take individual climate action. In the words of a Canadian investment blogger, *"every dollar you spend or invest is a vote for the companies and their ethical and sustainability practices"* [@fotheringhamHowCreateGreener2017]. The combination of consumption and investment is an access point to get the consumer thinking about investing. Even if the amount are small, they are a starting point for a thought process.

Digitalisation of payments creates lots of Point of Sale (PoS) data that's valuable to understand what people buy. Banks have access to each person's financial habits which makes it possible to model sustainable behavior using big data analysis. Asian markets have shown the fastest growth in the use of digital payments [@mckinseyNextFrontierAsia2020].

In Taiwan, O Bank makes use of Mastercard's data to calculate each transaction's CO~2~ emissions and offer Taiwanese clients "Consumer Spending Carbon Calculator" and "Low-Carbon Lifestyle Debit Card" products [@TaiwanOBankLaunches2022]. Mastercard has developed a service that banks can offer consumers sustainability reports [@mastercardMastercardUnveilsNew2021]. Similarly, Commons, formerly known as Joro, an independent app, analyses your personal financial data to estimate your CO~2~ footprint [@chantPersonalCarboncuttingApp2022].

A Dutch fintech company Bunq offers payment cards for sustainability, provided by MasterCard, which connects everyday payments to green projects, such as planting trees and donations to charities within the same user interface [@bunqBunq2020]. At the same time this can be considered greenwashing as Bunq only plants 1 tree per every €1,000 spend with a Bunq card. The example marketed at students cites *8 trees planted this month* while students scarcely would have €8,000 to spend every month.

Sharing a similar goal to Alibaba's Ant Forest, Bunq's approach creates a new interaction dynamic in a familiar context (card payments), enabling customers to effortlessly contribute to sustainability. However, it lacks the level of gamification which makes Alibaba's offering so addictive, while also not differentiating between the types of purchases the consumer makes, in terms of the level of eco-friendliness.

In Nigeria, [@emeleonuNigeriaCapsATM2022] reports how in order to promote the eNaira digital currency use, the Nigerian government limited the amount of cash that can be withdrawn from ATMs *"In Nigeria's largely informal economy, cash outside banks represents 85% of currency in circulation and almost 40 million adults are without a bank account."* **\[E-Naira find papers\]**

In Kenya, M-Pesa started since 2007 for mobile payments, used by more than 80% of farmers [@tyceNeoliberalstatistDivideDrivers2020; @parlascaUseMobileFinancial2022]. Using digital payments instead of cash enables a new class of experiences, in terms of personalization, and potentially, for sustainability.

In Sweden, point of sales (PoS) lending is a common practice, and one of the reasons for the success of Klarna, the Swedish banking startup, which has managed to lend money to more consumers than ever, through this improved user experience. Taking out loans for consumption is a questionable personal financial strategy at best. If people can loan money at the point of sales, why couldn't there be 180 degrees opposite service - point of sales investing? And there is, called "round-up apps". @AcornsTargetsMillennials suggests *"Targeted at millennials, Acorns is the investing app that rounds up purchases to the nearest dollar and invests the difference."* - and example of From Shopping to Investing.

Many banks have started offering a service to automatically save and invest tiny amounts of money collected from shopping expenses. Every purchase one makes contributes a small percentage - usually rounded up to the nearest whole number - to one's investment accounts. For example, @swedbankEasySaver2022, the leading bank in the Estonian market, offers a savings service where everyday payments made with one's debit card are rounded up to the next Euro, and this amount is transferred to a separate savings account. Similarly, the Estonian bank @lhvMicroinvestmentGrowthAccount2020 offers micro-investing and micro-savings services, with an interesting user experience innovation showing how for an average Estonian means additional savings of about 400€ per year.

While the financial industry is highly digitized, plenty of banks are still paper-oriented, running digital and offline processes simultaneously, making them slower and less competitive, than startups. Indeed, the new baseline for customer-facing finance is set by fintech, taking cues from the successful mobile apps in a variety of sectors, foregoing physical offices, and focusing on offering the best possible online experience for a specific financial service, such as payments.

Banks and Fintech are becoming more similar than ever. 39% of Millenials are willing to leave their bank for a better fintech (n=4,282); innovation in payments helps retention [@pymntsStayingAheadPayments2023]. The European Central Bank describes fintech as improving the user experience across the board, making interactions more convenient, user-friendly, cheaper, and faster. "Fintech has had a more pronounced impact in the payments market \[...\] where the incumbents have accumulated the most glaring shortcomings, often resulting in inefficient and overpriced products," Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB says in @europeancentralbankLendingPaymentSystems2019.

There are also people who are concerned with digital payments. There are concerns digital currencies also help to *"democratize financial surveillance".* China was a money innovator introducing paper money in the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD) [@FirstPaperMoney]. @jeffbensonChinaReleasesDigital2022 "use the e-CNY network to increase financial surveillance." @CentralBankDigital2023 Digital currencies make tracking easier. @yahoofinanceChallengesFacingChina2022: WeChat, Alipay, vs digital yuan by Eswar Prasad. @ContactlessPaymentsPrevalent2023 in Macau Contactless Payments are prevalent.

There are many *neobanks*, or challenger banks, far too many to list. The table only includes a small sample of banks and the landscape is even larger if one includes the wider array of fintechs. Neo-banks often use sustainability marketing.

Alipay already provides two investment services within it's payments app, at first launching Yu'e Bao (餘額寶) in 2013, which automatially invests small amounts on the users' accounts for returns typically above those of traditional banks' saving accounts, and later in 2015 Ant Fortune (螞蟻財富), offering access to thousands of investment products from partner companies [@kranesharesAntGroup101202].

Payment apps created by Apple and Google are less-feature rich focusing on payments only. None of the largest payment apps have a specific focus on sustainability while Alipay does have a separate sustainability-focused service called Ant Forest for planting treess.

#### Buy Now Pay Later

Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) is the biggest consumer payments / financing success story innovated by Klarna in Sweden in 2005 and Afterpay in Australia in 2015 but with roots in Layaway Programs created during the 1930's US Great Depression [@kentonWhatLayawayPlan2023]. By 2021, 44.1% of Gen-Z in the US had used BNPL according to [@emarketerAlmost75BNPL2021]. Gen-Z mostly use BNPL to buy clothes [@lhvBuyNowPay2024].

-   ***Design Implication:*** This suggests users are already used to having more options in the payment flow.

### Saving

There are two ways to look at sustainable saving. This section is going to look at savings in the financial sense of the word. Savings in the sense of CO2e emission and environmental cost reductions have an entire separate chapter dedicated to them titled '*sustainability*' however a short definition might be valuable here as well.

> *Environmental Savings* means *"the credit incurred by a community that invests in environmental protection now instead of paying more for corrective action in the future*" [see @yalecenterforenvironmentallaw&policyEnvironmentalPerformanceIndex2018] and [@YalePrincetonStanford p.33].

#### Saving Money

Saving precedes investing. From building loyalty to building ownership, the first step towards investing is to start saving money. How to encourage savings in daily life and make it a part of the everyday payments experience? Even starting with a small step, gathering a small target amount per month for savings, has the potential to shift the user's way of thinking about money. The second step, choosing where to invest these savings, will help us begin thinking like an investor. To start noticing trends and looking into how finance shapes the world.

#### Psychology of Saving

Savings and investing are conflated because the large majority of savings that people have are invested by their banks. Thus the question of *sustainable savings* comes one of where exactly are they invested and what is the impact of that investment of sustainability. Savings are the money one has in a pension fund or managed by themselves. For the majority of people, savings are invested by the bank and make up the largest proportion on investments for the people who are not active investors themselves.

Nerdwallet's @tommytindallFinancialActionsSpeak2023 suggests making financial commitments instead of resolutions.

People will only save nature if it also saves money.

-   Ethical Savings [@EthicalSavingsEverything2023]

#### Anthropomorphism

-   Money in a “Safe” place: Money anthropomorphism increases saving behavior [@wangMoneySafePlace2023].

-   Mobile money users are better at saving [@naitoEffectMobileMoney2021].

-   ***Design Implication***: make saving money look like an avatar or piggy bank or smth.

#### Loyalty Schemes

help consumers save money and business increase repeat business. Building customer loyalty is a key part of repeat business and financial predictability for any company. Large consumer brands like Starbucks have for long ran successful rewards programs that encourage customers to come back [@steinhoffLoyaltyProgramsTravel2021]. Could loyalty schemes create a pathway to investing in the company to a strengthen the feeling of connection with the business even further? After all, I'm now a minority owner! Yet in practice, many consumers lack the financial literacy for investing and there are many legislative difficulties for turning loyalty points into investments. It's easier instead to create a separate cryptocurrency or token program which users could collect and redeem for some benefit.

-   **Patagonia** "Worn Wear" program

-   **H&M** "Garment Collecting" program

-   **The Body Shop** "Return, Recycle, Repeat"

Loyalty schemes can take a physical form. In Malaysia, Beebag shopping bags made of recycled plastic bottles with a NFC ship that works in conjunction with an app to provide rebates for customers [@thegreenfactorEP62Gamification2022].

-   Savings in CO~2~ Equivalent Emissions: CO~2~ savings are the amount of CO2e reduction one manages to achieve by changing one's behavior and influencing others (people, companies). While the individual footprint is so small, the largest reduction will come from influencing large groups of people, either by leadership, role-model, or other means. Pension funds are some of the largest asset holders and choosing where to invest one's pension can be a sustainable financial action. College students might not have a pension fund yet.

#### Saving CO2

### Investing

#### Measuring the Eco-Investment Gap

By the latest estimates sustainability lacks several trillions of USD in investment. Even with massive financing already in the pipeline, the estimate for the global *financing gap* for low-carbon energy production was 5.2 trillion USD as of 2016 [@MappingGapRoad2016; @earthdayEarthDay20232023]. Ray Dalio puts the needed climate investment at \$5T and believes these financial goals won't be met [@raydalioFourthBigForce2023]. A newer United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) calculation lowered the world needs an additional 4.1 Trillion USD of financing in nature-based solutions by 2050 to meet climate change, biodiversity, and land degradation reduction targets [@unepUNEPGreenFinance2022].

According to [@therockefellerfoundationWhatGetsMeasured2022] a slightly lower 2.5-3.2 Trillion USD would be sufficient.

```{python}
climate_finance_gap_sectors_timeline()
```

What if 10% of annual consumer spending – *ten percent is about \$2,8T* - went towards protecting our climate? The theme for the 2023 Earth Day was *"Invest In Our Planet"*.

```{python}
climate_finance_gap_sectors()
```

The needed investment doesn't seem so large, around 5% of the global GDP, if one compares it to the *per year* Global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) estimated at around 100 Trillion USD in 2022 and growing to 105 Trillion USD in 2023 [@aarononeillGlobalGDP198520282023; @imfWorldEconomicOutlook2023GDPgrowth]. In essence, the estimated total investment gap in climate fits into the economic growth of 1 year of the global economy.

Bad news. It would be easier for large institutional investors to move their money to sustainable assets than for retail investors to move their relatively small investments.

The lack of funding in green energy especially affects emerging economies [@MobilizingCapitalEmerging2022]. *"We can and must channel private capital into nature-based solutions. This will require policy and regulatory support, catalytic capital and financial innovation"* argued the CEO Green Finance Institute, Dr Rhian-Mari Thomas, ahead of COP27 in Egypt [@GreenFinanceInstitute2023]. It's not happening fast enough.

While these assets and GDP values reflect different aspects of the global economy, the comparison illustrates that redirecting a relatively small fraction of global wealth and economic activity towards sustainable investments can close the investment gap. This perspective should inspire confidence that the goal is achievable with coordinated effort and policy support.

#### Sustainable Investing

While literature has been debating if it's possible to *"do well while doing good"*, latest research suggests it's possible to make investments that both make an attractive financial return and adhere to sustainability goals. @tanPerformanceESGintegratedSmart2023

"sustainable investing is now part of mainstream financial strategy" @morganstanleySustainableSignalsIndividual2019

"Sustainable development requires more investment in sustainable companies and less in unsustainable firms." [@vanzantenWhoOwnsSustainable2023].

#### Young Investors Follow Financial Influencers

Young investors are typically *retail investors* investing small amounts of money for themselves. (Unless they have inherited wealth or are among the very few who work in an institution such as an investment firm, university endowment, pension fund or mutual fund, and have a say in where to invest large amounts of other peoples' money.)

Retail investors face many challenges in comparison with their institutional counterparts. For instance, they may have much less time to do proper research, face information asymmetries, where finding good information is limited by time, ability, as well as financial literacy, whereas professional investors have the tools, skills, time, and knowledge, to make better investment decisions.

-   *For young people, investing mostly means buying cryptocurrencies?*

-   Copy-investing is a popular feature of retail investing platforms like EToro

-   Investing is a fundamentally hopeful act. It means I think there's a future. Specifically, 'green investing' is investing in the future of our planet - but can we trust the sustainability practices the 'green' investment vehicles aggregate, promising to have a positive impact? For example, the European Union for many years counted biomass as 'green' energy, even while forestry companies were cutting down trees to produce the biomass - the regulation was not specific enough to curb this practice. So, in effect, a 'green investor' might be supporting deforestation. How can an easy-to-use investment app address such complexities without alienating the users?

```{python}
retail_green_vs_nongreen()
```

-   Information evavõrdsus disparity between pro and novice investors

Retail investing also heavily influenced by social media influencers.

Retail investing apps blend entertainment into the UX/UI of investing. For example Robinhood uses game-like features such as displaying a confetti animation to create a sense of excitement around trading investing. Retail investing UI/UX is simplified and gamified, which encourage impulsive short-term buying and selling with a focus on speculation over fundamentals and cause FOMO (fear of missing out).

*Meme stocks* are another aspect of the *entertainmenization* of investing. There are many groups of Twitter, Reddit, and elsewhere, where investing trends start, causing more volatility.

Community Investing Enables Financial Inclusion

-   Inexperienced investor can copy other people when investing. You don't know how to invest? Build an investing community? Can follow others and raise capital together. In some ways community-investing competes with robo-advisors as communities can be led by professional investors and followed by less sophisticated investors. Investor communities can have the type of *social proof*, which robo-advisor do not possess.

    Influencer - crypto twitter connections

-   Cryto influencers like combine beauty with investing @irenezhaoHereWhy0xIreneDao2022

#### Financial Literacy

-   Financial Literacy. Sustainability Literacy. Financial and Sustainability Literacy are intertwined. How can finance enable/help/encourage sustainability?
-   @austinryderHowBecomeInvestor2020 Define your habits: are you consumer or investor?

Retail investors typically have less financial literacy.

#### Retail Investing Enables Financial Inclusion

*Retail investing* can be seen as a form of financial inclusion. Ant Group's CEO Eric Jing says in [@turrinCashlessChinaDigital2021]: *"The financial system of the past 200 years was designed for the industrial era and served only 20% of the population and organizations. As we enter the digital age, we must better serve the remaining 80%".*

Among retail investors, there's some appetite for sustainability however investors are not sure how to separate sustainable assets from less sustainable ones [@hoAsianInvestorsAre2019].

-   Consumption is ruining the world the world thinking as an investor the investor mindset

@doornStocksThatShould2020: Many ecologically focused funds with different approaches have been launched in recent years, with variations in asset mix and style of management. Thematic asset management is expected to grow, with investors packaging opportunities based on consumer trends.

@smithChinaUltraElite2019 suggests 74% of Chinese youth are looking for "positive impact".

-   @lingeswaranLevellingShatteringMyths2019 suggest philanthropy is on the rise in Asia however

-   @liCanRetailInvestors2022 suggests retail "investor attention can significantly improve enterprises' green innovation level"

-   But there's so much capital in large funds retails investor money doesn't matter at all. does retail money make any difference? Retail Investor Helpers: A wide number of banks are offering services marketed a sustainable. It's hard to decide.

-   For example - In Sweden "Preferences for sustainable and responsible equity funds

-   Sweden is a in countries with highly developed financial markets and active social campaigns demanding sustainability (Sweden)

-   @lagerkvistPreferencesSustainableResponsible2020 undertook a choice experiment with Swedish private investors.

-   @MeetFintechsLeading2021 ***Swedish green fintech (important article)***

-   Gov launching ESG funds.

-   Why is this important to research now? People in their twenties should invest in their future. Millennials and younger generations like services with a green, eco-conscious focus. Given our combined power (I'm a Millennial) with Generation Z, we are willing to pay more for sustainable products.

-   Personalized Investing

-   2022 saw a wave of new platforms aiming to make investing easier for retail investors

-   One example is Revolut, which expanded from a simple payments app to support varied saving and investment types [@RevolutLaunchesETF2023; @KickstartYourInvestment2023].

-   Gamestop for climate massively collaborative investing by gen-z?

#### Financial Ecologies

-   @TAN202046 proposes *"financial ecologies"* to understand the dynamic relationships between various actors: investors, advisors, government, where the government plays an active role in growing financial inclusion and responsible financial management. However, the paper further suggests that current robo-advisors (available in Singapore) make the investor captive to the agency of AI, making the person lose agency over their financial decisions.

#### Green and Sustainability-Linked Bonds

Bonds are a form of debt investment also known as an fixed-income asset where the principal is repaid at the maturation date of the bond (usually in years) with an added premium. Individuals can't emit bonds but they can invest in them. It can be a way to invest locally in one's own city - or globally. For individuals, there's access to some green bond exposure through ETFs (exchange-traded funds) available on retail investing apps.

Access is not universal and availability depends on the geography of the user and local legislation; for example Revolut, the most downloaded finance app in the EU, only enabled bond investing for European customers in summer 2024 [@revolutRevolutUnlocksBonds2024; @revolutOur2023Annual2024]. Investing in bonds is a form of *Passive Investing* and allows investors focus on low-risk passive income instead of daily stock investing most popular on Robinhood and Revolut - albeit with much less potential for returns.

-   Climate Bonds Initiative is working on greening the \$55 trillion short-term debt (bond) market [@ClimateBondsInitiative2022].

*Green bonds* are released by companies, international organizations, and cities to raise money for green transformation, usually for building something to improve sustainability, tied to specific projects. There's a growing global trend in green bond emission, with 257 Billion USD worth of green bonds issued in 2019, expected to reach 1 Trillion USD annually by 2030 [@macaskillThereGreenPremium2021]. That prediction was too low with 870 Billion USD green bond emissions reached already in 2023; currently Europe is the largest emitter of green bonds [@climatebondsClimateBondsInteractive2023]. China has the 2nd largest green bond market in the world and it's growing fast; buyers are looking for green bond certification to reduce yield spread, meaning the price of the green bond is becoming more similar to the price of a 'regular' bond [@pengManagingFinancingCosts2022; @liWhereGreenBond2022].

In 2017 the Malmö city in Sweden released green bonds to finance a sustainable transition of the city [@cityofmalmoGreenBondFramework2017]. An independent analysis found bonds may not be emitted for financial reasons but to improve the reputation and city image, lower interest rate (aptly named *greenium*) with a similar in returns to traditional bonds - and have their share of challenges, namely being difficult to certify, monitor, report and measure impact of [@sjostromFinancingSustainableCity2020].

Making sure a green bond is truly supporting sustainability is a challenge. For example, Aramco, the Saudi Arabian public petroleum and natural gas company faced scrutiny for what critics deemed as 'Fake green bonds' [@anthropocenefixedincomeinstituteafiiAFIIAramcoReplacement2022]. Green bonds can also be emitted on blockchains with the stated goal of improving transparency. Hong Kong multi-currency green bond on the blockchain. The issuer (Hong Kong government) hopes to reduce greenwashing [@hallHKBreaksNew2024; @kitanoHongKongHarnesses2024]. In the EU as well, there are emerging tools for monitoring green bonds on blockchain [@christodoulouBlockchainbasedFrameworkEffective2023]. [@qinBlockchainMarketGreen2023] finds evidence that the combination of green bonds and blockchains are an enabler carbon neutrality in China. The World Bank successfully raised 110 Million USD in Australia in 2018-19 and has since doubled the amount in a new 220 Million USD emission in Switzerland using bonds on a blockchain ledger for SDG-related projects [@worldbankWorldBankPartners2024; @worldbankWorldBankIssues2019; @worldbankWorldBankPrices2018].

```{python}
world_bank_bonds()
```

Sustainability-Linked Bonds are less stringent than green bonds; they are not tied to specific projects but more broad sustainability targets [@priscilaazevedorochaGreenwashingEnters222022]: "Sustainability-linked bonds let companies borrow cheaply if they meet environmental, social, and governance targets. A Bloomberg News analysis found those goals are weak". [@priscilaazevedorochaGreenwashingEnters222022] suggests *"So far, most ESG investing is in the stock market. But the the \$22 trillion corporate bond market, where mature global companies such as Chanel go to borrow money from investors, has a particularly powerful role to play. Companies rely on debt much more than they do on stocks."*

#### Investment Platforms

"Green Bonds, Sustainable Equities, ESG-focused Mutual Funds and ETFs, Impact Investing (through platforms), Renewable Energy Infrastructure (via ETFs or mutual funds), Sustainable Real Estate (through REITs or ETFs), Social Bonds, Carbon Credits (via ETFs or specialized funds), Sustainable Commodities (via ETFs or funds), Community Investing (through CDFIs or crowdfunding platforms), Sustainable Infrastructure Funds (available as ETFs or mutual funds), Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Metrics Integration (through broad ESG-focused ETFs or funds)"

Such as "green shops" there are green investing platforms, green ETFs, etc. All of these are essentially forms of branding designed to make it easier for investors to find an investing product they trust.

There are many 'green investment platforms' who to trust?

#### Hedge Funds

Hedge funds generally are not accessible to retail investors, requiring a substantial minimum investment. However some Hedge Fund ETFs and Mutual Funds with Hedge Fund Strategies may try to mimic hedge fund strategies investing in the same assets.

It's how the wealthier people invest.

-   While hedge funds used to be available for professional investors, *smart contracts* make it possible to create decentralized organizations which pool member resources for investing.

[@blackrockESGInvestingHedge2022] notes some ESG-oriented hedge funds can be "highly engaged with management teams" in order to influence management towards ESG practices in said companies.

#### Investable Asset Classes: Growing Choice for Retail Investors

new asset classes

```{python}

```

There are many asset classes only some of which would be accessible to a retail investors.

-   The main categories of investment products are, based on the @InvestmentProductsInvestor

| Investment Product                            |

#### Assets: Commodities

#### Assets: Real Estate

According to [@debnathSocialMediaEnables2022] 39% of global CO~2~ emissions comes from the building sector. Construction is large emitter because of the use of concrete; super tall buildings are very CO~2~ intensive [@zhaoEmbodiedCarbonBased2015]. Building emissions can be reduced by using sustainable design and materials, *digital twins* of architecture enable pre-visualization of different designs [@panaroHowCanPairing2024] as well modeling the usage of the building, for example the interior shop floors in commercial real-estate [@jiaSimpleDigitalTwin2023]. In housing development, there's evidence of 'green' buildings achieving a 'higher financial return than conventional buildings, both in terms of rent and sale price' [@oyedokunGreenPremiumDriver2017].

Investing into real-estate is increasingly available on co-investing platforms allowing retail investors access into this asset class with a relatively low starting price. Thus investing in sustainable architecture can be an attractive proposal both from an environmental as from a financial standpoint, also providing a passive income stream in the form of rent.

#### Assets: Stocks

-   Most popular

#### Assets: Lending

Retail investors can lend small amounts of money (also known as MicroLending) on peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms such as Twino. These loans and pooled and the risk is borne in aggregate as a form of risk-management.

#### Assets: Crypto

There's a large trend of fusion of decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional finance (TradFi), with the largest established investors, such as BlackRock, launching tokenized funds [@sandorTokenizedTreasuryFunds2024; @matosAaveLabsUnveils2024; @securitizeBlackRockLaunchesIts2024].

Crypto investing removes most entry barriers while having high risk. Cryptocurrencies are the most popular financial action among young people (ADD CITATION) yet in some ways crypto needs even more financial literacy than traditional financial assets. @CryptocurrenciesWorldwideStatista estimates over 860 million cryptocurrency users worldwide by 2025.

Brazilian (N=573 ) "Crypto investors in Brazil are generally younger, male, and exhibit higher risk tolerance compared to non-crypto investors." @colomboAreCryptoNoncrypto2024 "Brazil's planned adoption of CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency)." "It finds that risk tolerance, economic pessimism, and a belief in better investment acumen are significant predictors of crypto investment."

**Centralized Crypto Exchanges vs Self-Wallets** - Centralized Crypto Exchanges are in essence loaning assets from the user. "The piece of the settlement aimed at getting important information to customers is more understandable from a retail protection standpoint. Customers who lend crypto assets to a company in exchange for a promised return should get the information they need to assess the risks against the rewards" [@hesterm.peirceSECGovStatement2022].

**Financial Engineering** - Crypto enables financial innovation and financial engineering by anyone with some programming skills.

**Pricing Crypto**

-   Taiwan bans buying cryptocurrencies with credit card because the volatility makes it similar to gambling [@davidattleeBuyingCryptoCredit2022; @MiHuoBi2022].

-   However volatility is relative. Volatile national currencies lead people to find other assets to hold. If your national currency is collapsing, you might find crypto has a relative safe haven to keep your funds.

-   People like Turkey losing 75% of the value of their assets when currency collapses, why people buy crypto.

-   Bitcoin is by far the most popular cryptocurrency with it's high price volatility creating opportunities for high gains and high losses. While bitcoin has been called a "digital gold" for store of value, its volatility characteristics are very different from gold, as seen on this chart.

```{python}
bitcoin_vs_gold_futures()
```

The volatility of the markets has notably shifted crypto research towards pricing theories.

```{python}
crypto_pricing_theories()
```

For example, in X research an index of major sustainability news was compared with crypto prices, which may have negative, positive, or no correlation with the following cryptocurrencies.

**Insitutional Funds Enter Crypto** Crypto ETFs enable people to have exposure to crypto without ever buying cryptocurrencies directly themselves. - @swissinfo.ch/ursSwissCryptoValley2022 "More than half of the Swiss banks plan to offer digital assets services over the next few years." - @BankNewEconomy: Crypto bank - @raidotonissonLHVToiKlientideni2022 Estonian bank selling Metaverse cryptocurrency Sandbox

**DAOs**

DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) can be use in a similar way to Hedge funds, a DAO can have a shared multi-sign wallet than is invested together.

A lot of financial tooling and more than trad-fi has been replicated in crypto.

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) which have an investable treasury may be compare to Hedge Funds as a collective form of investing. Because of the on-chain nature where transactions are visible to anyone, they may be seen as more transparent. Typically DAOs have a voting system to make decision while Hedge Funds may be more centrally controlled. Also, the legislation affecting each would be different as hedge funds are an older and more established financial tool whereas DAOs still fall in somewhat of a gray area.

**Oracles for Sustainability Data**

Intersection with finance and Real World Data.

A data oracle is the concept of a source of real-world data which can be ingested through an application programming interface (API) to a blockchain system. There are many databases of sustainability information which could serve as an oracle for carbon labeling, packaging, transportation, consumption, and waste.

"We believe that markets for ecosystem assets need to scale urgently, starting with carbon markets. The challenge is to make these instruments as recognizable as tradable assets, as measurable as financial securities, and as investable as other asset classes. Capital must flow into the environment at scale to deliver climate action." "Efficient financial markets allocate and manage risk based on effective price mechanisms, and this relies on access to credible information. " @bezeroScalingCarbonMarkets2022

"Everyone in the market is struggling to effectively price and manage risk.. the Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM); a rapidly recovering market, forecasted to grow by as much as 100x, but constrained by a nascent market structure." "The BCR is a carbon-only expected return model. It utilises a risk-based approach and seeks to give everyone a common language of risk.

#### Divesting

Divesting is the inverse of investing. Divesting may have a meaningful impact on companies if large numbers of retail investors collaborate on 'banning' the company to send a message to the board. Small individual divestment has no impact on the governance decisions.

In institutional finance, the Norwegian \$1.3T USD sovereign wealth fund (the world's largest) started a divestment trend in 2016 by divesting first from coal following by divesting from oil, gas and coal extracting companies [@benmartinWorldLargestWealth2017; @holgerNorwaySovereignWealthFund2019]. Their plan to reach net zero CO2e nonetheless only targets 2050. Furthermore, who would be the counterpart for such large transactions. The fund also announced divesting from Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, however has yet to sell any shares citing lack of buyers on the Moscow stock market.

University of California also followed suit with divestment of its \$126B USD portfolio from oil and gas.

While divesting makes news headlines, even divestment by large institutional investors, such as the Norwegian National Pension Fund (GPFG), has a negligible effect on the heavy polluters' business; by the same logic, it can be deducted, the financial effect of retail investors divesting, is meaningless. If retail investors act in aggregate, the reputational effect needs further research. *"To halt climate change, some investors have decided to divest from fossil fuel companies. Reviewing the literature suggests that divestment from fossil fuel has limited financial consequences; it slightly increases divested firms’ risk and their cost of capital, while reducing divested firms’ market value,"* is the pessimistic conclusion by[@plantingaFinancePerspectiveFossil2024]

-   Even with divesting from oil and has, Norway Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG) still adheres to the Markowitz's Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), with enough diversification between assets [@papaioannouSovereignWealthFund2015]

## Econometrics: Decoupling Economic Growth from Eco-Degradation

Is the "eco" in ecology and economy the same? Oîkos, the Greek word for “household”, seeds two modern disciplines: ecology studies how the home works; economy sets the rules for managing it. The two have drifted apart: one guarding planetary health, the other chasing growth. This chapter reunites them by asking: how do we measure prosperity without wrecking our home?

#### The Many Ways to Measure an Economy

*Econometrics* is the science of measuring the economy.

> The creator of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) metric in 1934 Simon Kuznets said: "The welfare of a nation can scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income as defined by GDP...Goals for 'more' growth should specify of what and for what" [@unitedstates.bureauofforeignanddomesticcommerceNationalIncome192919321934].

GDP was the culmination of previous work by many authors, beginning with William Petty in the 17th century [@rockoffGoodStartNBER2020]. This long journey underlines how a metric about a complex system such as the economy is continuous work in progress. There has been ongoing work to create improved metrics such as the the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Human Development Index (HDI), Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), Green GDP, Inclusive Wealth Index, and others [@bleysBarriersOpportunitiesAlternative2015; @kovacicGDPIndicatorsNeed2015; @anielskiMeasuringSustainabilityNations2001].

Measuring wellbeing in addition to GDP and the metric should including resiliency dashboards, to to visualize metrics beyond GDP and they are an integral part of country reports [@greensefaBeyondGrowthChangingGoal2023]. Similarly, the doughnut (donut) economics (more below) model calls for a *"dashboard of indicators"* [@tedHealthyEconomyShould2018].

-   The true cost of products is hidden. The work is hidden.

#### The Evolution of Economic Metrics

The first two decades of the 21st century have seen increasing economic thinking, looking to challenge, improve and upgrade capitalism to match our current environmental, social, and technological situation, often called *New Economics.* Some of these include behavioral economics, sustainable capitalism, regenerative capitalism, doughnut economics, ecological economics, blue economy, degrowth, attention economy, gift economy, intent economy, among others. There's no lack of published books on changing capitalism, which goes to show there's readership for these ideas. Build a new economic theory is out of scope for my thesis design, however I'll focus on the parts of economic theory I believe are relevant for *interaction design*-ing for sustainability.

```{python}
econ_history_chart()
```

There are those looking for *new metrics*. One of the first innovators, already in 1972, was Buthan, with the *Gross National Happiness Index (GNH)*, which in turn inspired the UN, decades later, in 2012, to create the International Wellbeing and Happiness Conference and the International Happiness Day[@ribeiroGrossNationalHappiness2017; @kameiUrbanizationCarbonNeutrality2021]. The World Bank talks about the comprehensive GDD+ metrics in its Changing the Wealth of Nations report [@worldbankChangingWealthNations2021].

The Wellbeing Economy Alliance (WEAll) countries (New Zealand, Iceland, Finland, Scotland, Wales) as well as the EU and Canada, started the coalition in 2018 looking to involve more broad-based metrics in developing their societies[@ellsmoorNewZealandDitches2019; @davidsuzukifoundationWellbeingEconomies2021; @ceprFairSustainableProsperous2022; @scottishgovernmentWellbeingEconomyGovernments2022; @wellbeingeconomyallianceWhatWellbeingEconomy2022].

@giacaloneWellbeingAnalysisItalian2022 looks at wellbeing of Italian communities and proposes a new composite index.

There's work ongoing on macroeconomic modeling, aiming to create a *digital twin* of the economy. Some of the most complex computer models of the economy include the Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal Model (GIMF) [@laxtonGlobalIntegratedMonetary2010] and DSGE (Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium).

#### Hidden Costs: Pricing Externalities

Markets mis‑price “home maintenance.”

Co-founder of Generation Capital with 50 Billion under management David Blood "the most sifinifcat thing we can do as capital allocators is to price in those difficult to price externnalities" @liebreichAreBigInvestors2025

In the simplest sense, prices do not capture all costs. "Consumption, production, and investment decisions of individuals, households, and firms often affect people not directly involved in the transactions" [@helblingExternalitiesPricesNot2012]. Externalities as an economic concept was implied by Alfred Marshall, one of the founders of neoclassical economics, in his 1890 treatise "Principles of Economics," and further developed by Arthur Cecil Pigou in his 1920 book "The Economics of Welfare" [@marshallPrinciplesEconomics1997; @pigouEconomicsWelfare2002]. As of 2023, the value of unpriced externalities which are not included in the GDP is 7.3 trillion USD per year [@trucostNaturalCapitalRisk2023]. The award-winning economist Mariana Mazzucato argues in [@guptaElectrifyingEconomistGuide2020] we should include more into how we value unpaid labor, relating to the social (S in ESG) [@mazzucatoValueEverythingMaking2018] as part of our metrics.

#### Ecological Economics Builds Upon Classical Economics

While Adam Smith is most famous for his concept of the *invisible hand* first appearing in *The Theory of Moral Sentiments* (1759) and further developed in his seminal work *The Wealth of Nations*, published in 1776, his writings also highlight the interdependence of economic actors, who through specialization increase productivity, but also increasingly dependent on each another as well as the role of empathy in individual actions [@atalAdamSmithHis2024].

Ecological economics doesn't necessarily argue with the foundation of classical economics, rather ecological economics finds the classical economics model and by extension neoclassical economics are *incomplete,* ignoring the physical limits of natural resources. Ecological economics draws attention to the interdependence of economy and the ecosystem; there are physical limits to economic growth on a planet with finite resources.

The biggest point of contention is the necessity of *economic growth*. The founder of ecological economics Herman Daly was talking about *prosperity without growth* more than two decades ago, focusing on the diminishing natural resources [@dalyGrowthEconomicsSustainable1997]. Daly was teaching economics to undergraduates at Louisina State University when he grew dissatisfied with the standard model of the market, which didn't include any inputs (resources) or outputs (pollution), and later modeled his work by placing the economy *within* the larger system of the ecosphere [@ketchamWhenIdiotSavants2023]. More recently.[@jacksonProsperityGrowthEconomics2009; @jacksonProsperityGrowthFoundations2017] have expanded on these ideas with recipes for a *post-growth* world, making the ideas seem more tangible and precise, yet mostly untested in the real world.

Writing in 1973, E. F. Schumacher argued economics overlooks both natural resource depletion and environmental degradation and draws on religion (particularly Buddhism) to suggest a simpler way of life:

> *"Simplicity and non-violence are obviously closely related. The optimal pattern of consumption, producing a high degree of human satisfaction by means of a relatively low rate of consumption, allows people to live without great pressure and strain and to fulfil the primary injunction of Buddhist teaching: 'Cease to do evil; try to do good.'"* [@schumacherSmallBeautifulEconomics1985]

New economic thinkers are asking how can economic growth and sustainability be compatible. Some even ask if *economic growth* itself is the wrong goal? [@diduchEconomicGrowthWrong2020]. Degrowth is the most famous contender in that branch of economics. Is Decoupling Economic Growth and CO2e Emissions Possible? Is Green Growth an oxymoron? No-one knows as it hasn't been done before. Degrowth proponents are pessimistic it's possible to decouple greenhouse gas emissions from economic growth; historical data shows does not show any decoupling. Some data from China shows decoupling?

The original Ramsey model introduced by Frank P. Ramsey in 1928, becoming foundational for traditional economic growth theory, does not assume infinite economic growth [@attanasioFrankRamseysMathematical2015]. [@marcgermainSimpleDegrowthModel2016] has adoped the Ramsey Model and introduced constraints such as pollution, distinguishing renewable and non-renewable capital.

#### Doughnut Economics and Regenerative Capitalism

*Doughnut Economics*, introduced in the eponymous book uses a simple visualization of a doughnut (donut) to help us grasp the big picture of the economy *embedded* inside the physical and social worlds [@raworthDoughnutEconomicsSeven2017]. It allows one to see the social shortfall and ecological overshoot of nations at the same time [@fanningSocialShortfallEcological2021]. The doughnut concept is simple and deep at the same time, a useful as social object to enable starting conversations with people from all walks of life, independent of their politics leanings. As Raworth calls it, it's a *"self-portrait of humanity in the beginning of the 21st century"**.*** Combining the *SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals)* inside the doughnut and the *Planetary Boundaries* (Earth's ecological ceiling) outside the doughnut, leaves a space inside the donut represents a state of equilibrium and balance on spaceship Earth.

In some ways this Doughnut Economics can be described as a movement. Doughnut Action Labs enable local communities to build local donuts customized to local problems. While the ideas have not yet been implemented on a country-level, smaller scale doughnut economics' success stories have inspired cities to take a comprehensive view of the doughnut of their own city with several EU cities adopting the vision [@teicherDoughnutEconomicsHas2021]. While critics say doughnut economics would expand the role of the government [@horwitzThereHoleMiddle2017], doughnut practitioners in Brussels believe everything can be adapted to the place and context [@oikosdenktankWebinarDoughnutEconomics2021; @brusselsdonutHomeBrusselsDonut2022].

The city of Amsterdam is developing shorter food chains (which save CO~2e~) and linking residents with food production and reconnecting people to the food which foster collaboration in the community [@circleeconomyKeynoteIlektraKouloumpi2021]. Amsterdam has also built comprehensive dashboards called the Circular Economy Monitor which makes it easy for anyone to see the progress being made towards the Dutch goal to be a circular economy by 2050 [@waterstaatCircularDutchEconomy2019; @gemeenteamsterdamCircularEconomyMonitor2022].

: From [@circleeconomyKeynoteIlektraKouloumpi2021].

*In his 2015 paper Regenerative Capitalism*, John Fullerton, an investor and a capital markets and derivatives expert, builds his economic theory on the ideas of Club of Rome and the Limits to Growth [@meadowsLimitsGrowthReport1972] as well as taking inspiration from R. Buckminster Fuller.

> *"Nature is a totally efficient, self-regenerating system. If we discover the laws that govern this system and live synergistically within them, sustainability will follow and humankind will be a success."* [@fullerGrunchGiants1983]

"\[H\]uman civilization is embedded in the biosphere," Fullerton's ideas aim to balance efficiency with resiliency so the whole system doesn't become brittle and break [@johnfullertonJohnFullertonWhen2011; @confinoCapitalismSocialismCould2015; @johnfullertonRegenerativeBusinessPart2022]. While regenerative capitalism recognizes the need for economic growth it also deems "\[t\]he quality of growth matters" [@RegenerativeCapitalismNew2023]. For example, he cites the example of Triodos Bank which already in the 1980s focused on sustainable banking championing responsibility, transparency, and business ethics. A member of the Global Alliance for Banking on Values, Triodos finances projects in nature preservation and restoration [@gabvTriodosBankUK2023].

### Decarbonization Scenarios

The possibility of decoupling economic growth from CO~2e~ emissions (also known as decarbonizing the economy or eco-economic decoupling) or is hotly debated (pun intended) among scientists. [@keysserDegrowthScenariosSuggest2021] provides several scenarios for low, medium, and high levels of decoupling titled Degrowth, IPCC, and Dec-Extreme.

```{python}
climate_scenarios_chart()
```

Looking a the United Kingdom, [@harrissonAnalysisWhyUK2019] concludes UK's CO~2e~ emissions have fallen 43% from 1990 to 2017 through the use of less carbon-intensive energy sources and argues for moderate policies in [@hausfatherEmissionsBusinessUsual2020].

```{python}
uk_energy_emissions_trend()
```

Meanwhile the cumulative CO~2e~ emissions trend in the UK in the same timeframe show the historic responsibility of UK [@globalcarbonbudgetCumulativeCOEmissions2023].

CO2e emissions and GDP growth per capita follow a similar path in the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) as well as in Vietnam and Somalia [@vianaespinosadeoliveiraRenewableNonrenewableEnergy2022; @warsameNaturalDisastersDeforestation2024; @raihanSustainabilityVietnamExamining2024].

### Reducing the Gap Between Climate Science and Climate Economics

William Nordhaus won a Nobel Prize in 2018 for attempting to combine climate change and economics in a single, integrated assessment model, named *Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy (DICE)*, however his predictions are considered inaccurate by climate scientists, underestimating the risk of catastrophic warming, tippings points, and the probability of higher temperatures leading to mass death [@ketchamWhenIdiotSavants2023; @sternEconomicsImmenseRisk2022; @sternTimeActionClimate2022; @kempClimateEndgameExploring2022; @jonesOurClimateReckless2019; @xuWellMitigationStrategies2017].

Energy and climate change economist Noah Kaufman says economists don't understand climate and climate scientists don't understand economics; and calls out economic calculations which try to estimate climate damages over hundreds of years or find a price for climate equilibrium, as nonsensical [@dessler2ClimateEconomicsNoah2024]. Instead, in a recent paper, co-written with another Nobel prize-winning economist, Joseph Stiglitz, they argue economics can solve climate change though a risk-management approach for policy support, focusing on lowering climate risk by achieving net-zero carbon emissions [@stiglitzHowEconomicsCan2024].

While Nordhaus has been criticized for his numbers, the general idea of his early book titled "The Climate Casino" doesn't disagree. Nordhaus himself likens the current trajectory of climate change to humanity entering a "climate casino," where we're is gambling with the planet's future [@nordhausClimateCasinoRisk2013]. Written a decade later, Nordhaus asks if we can still exit the casino, and is much more pessimistic than in his early work [@instituteofinternationalandeuropeanaffairsiieaCanWorldStill2023].

Although over 100 different scientific journals now publish work on sustainability economics, the field remains highly fragmented, with little interaction between research clusters. A bibliometric study of 1987–2013 publications found 11 largely self‑contained research clusters, with minimal cross‑citation; for example the Nordhaus‑style integrated‑assessment‑modeling literature had almost no overlap with another prominent researcher, Elinor Ostrom, whose work focuses on commons governance within sustainability economics [@druppOstromNordhausResearch2020].

Kaufman decries the lack of real-world data in the economic-climate models, and believes the simple assumptions should be replaced with much more complex scientific analysis [@dessler2ClimateEconomicsNoah2024].

## Greenwashing: Data-Driven Benchmarks

### The Problem of Greenwashing

Corporate hypocrisy is an important blocker of sustainable action. Both the European Commission and the Chair of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Gary Gensler have called for more legislation to curb business greenwashing practices. *"If it's easy to tell if milk is fat-free by just looking at the nutrition label, it might be time to make it easier to tell if"green" or "sustainable" funds are really what they say they are"* says Gensler [@ussecuritiesandexchangecommissionOfficeHoursGary2022]. EU regulation for standardizing sustainability reporting is called the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) entered into force in 2023 as is being gradually ramped up until 2027.

Green investing only makes sense if it's possible to distinguish sustainable investments from not sustainable ones. Humans feel as if choosing green is useless and give up. Sustainabile investing is firstly about changes in legislation which set stricter sustainability standards on companies (as discussed above). Secondly, increased transparency, new metrics, and new tools make it feasible to differentiate more sustainable companies from less sustainable ones.

Open ESG data platform Wikirate currently lists 4316 different metrics, essentially questions which companies should answer [@wikirateMetricsIntroduction2025].

```{python}
csrd_timeline()

Upcoming EU greenwashing legislation hopes to curb misleading communications by companies. *"Make benchmark methodologies more transparent when it comes to ESG & put forward standards for the methodology of low-carbon and ESG benchmarks in EU"* [@europeancommissionEULabelsBenchmarks2019]. Until new legislation is ramped up (2030 in the EU), building consumer awareness is crucial as currently most emission-reduction programs are voluntary and thus affected only by consumer demand [@andreVoluntaryCarbonNeutral2022]. Greenwashing is widespread in company social media communications [@geoffreysupranThreeShadesGreen2022]. A number of new AI-based tools aim to find instances of greenwashing. ClimateBert AI finds rampant greenwashing [@binglerCheapTalkCherryPicking2021; @sahotaAIAnalysis8002021].

While the EU has proposed legislation to curb greenwashing, EU climate policy itself has been criticized for greenwashing. Sometimes greenwashing comes under legislative protection [@fredericsimonCommissionFireIncluding2020 and @kirataylorEUPlanPuts2021]. [@boothBurningCarbonSink2022] describes how "A recent investigation shows illegal logging of protected areas in eastern European countries that supplies residential wood pellets in Italy. Belgium, Denmark, and the Netherlands are importing pellets from Estonia, where protected areas are logged for pellets and the country has lost its forest carbon sink, despite large-scale wood pellet plants being certified 'sustainable' by the Sustainable Biomass Program".

In recycling systems,[@purkissBigCompostExperiment2022] highlights the confusion between compostable and biodegradable plastics and public misunderstanding what happens to these plastics when they reach the landfill: "\[m\]ost plastics marketed as"home compostable" don't actually work, with as much as 60% failing to disintegrate after six months". Shopping bags marketed as *biodegradable* don't show deterioration after 3 years in salt-water sea environment [@napperEnvironmentalDeteriorationBiodegradable2019].

### Anti-greenwashing efforts in Taiwan

The Taiwanese Green Citizens Action Alliance published a comprehensive report in 2024 tracking Taiwanese Corporate Sustainability Reporting focused directly at fighting corporate greenwashing [@LuSeGongMinXingDongLianMengDaZaoFanPiaoLuShengTaiXi2024].

The Taiwanese Corporate Governance 3.0 - Sustainable Development Roadmap 3.0, published by the Corporate Governance Reform Task Force established by the Executive Yuan (Taiwanese Government), identifies *lack of diversity and independence in boards* and *insufficient ESG and financial information transparency* as key issues [@taiwanstockexchangecorporationTWSEGongSiZhiLiZhongXin2023].

The Taiwanese Financial Supervisory Commission, the Ministry of Environment, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, and the Ministry of the Interior collaborated on the *"Reference Guidelines for the Identification of Sustainable Economic Activities" to encourage the financial industry to assist enterprises in their transition to sustainable carbon reduction"* [@JinGuanHuiJinRongJianDuGuanLiWeiYuanHuiYongXuJinRongWang2022]

### Traceability Curbs Corruption

Traceability

EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR)

Know your suppliers' suppliers [@sourcemapSupplyChainMapping2025]

**The founder of Sourcemap** Leonardo Bonanni \*\*started with doing product autopsy in 2015 to assess products [@FastFashionLere2023]

What data should be surfaced to the consumer?

Supply Chain Mapping

Transaction Traceability

To put it very simply (knowingly oversimplifying), in traditional finance legislation is an enabler of corruption as in the case of Swiss privacy laws, where illegal funds can be hidden, while in cryptocurrencies, the lack of clear and comprehensive regulation is an enabler of corruption.

### Product Databases

In order to consider the sustainability on a product level, there should be a directory of all the world's products - a world product database. All of the world's products are subject to one or another standard and although they are not uniform, there's some documentation existing about every product.

In fact, while the UPC stands for Universal Product Code, there is no truly centralized, authoritative database of all UPCs, which has led to duplication and inconsistency across products sharing the same codes, especially with the rise of e-commerce marketplaces [@semantics3WhyUPCDoesn2017].

One important existing standard comes from GS1, the organization responsible for issuing EAN/UPC barcodes found on most consumer products worldwide [@gs1EANUPCBarcodes]. These barcodes help identify products within supply chains and retail systems, but they do not alone create a central product registry.

A number of specialized product databases have been created to fill specific needs. The Open Product Database maintained by Datakick [@DatakickOpenProduct] aimed to crowdsource product information but faced limitations and is no longer widely active. WIPO GREEN, the global green technology database, catalogs environmentally sustainable innovations [@WIPOGREENGlobal]. The World Packaging Database provides detailed information about product packaging worldwide, important for understanding material impacts [@PackagingWorld].

In a similar vein, @konradA16zCryptoLeads imagines the possibility of an internet-wide directory of purchasable products, akin to how platforms like Spotify have made nearly all of the world's music easily searchable and accessible. However, despite the obvious need, attempts to build such directories have faced significant challenges. For example, the Open Knowledge Foundation's Open Product Data initiative (@OpenProductData) was eventually shut down, highlighting how difficult it is to maintain open, comprehensive, and up-to-date product information at a global scale.

As early as 2016, questions were being raised about whether a truly global database of all EAN-13 barcoded products could be created [@hakonbogenThereGlobalDatabase2016]. The answer, unfortunately, remains "not yet."

While some infrastructure exists, including bar and qr-codes, standards, and partial databases, the world still lacks a unified, reliable, open-access product database. Building such a system could be improve sustainability assessments, supply chain transparency, and informed consumer choices at the global scale.

### Financialization

[@yukselConstructingIndexParticipation2023] criticizes excessive financialization where the real economy and financial markets disconnected, blaming it for the the 2008 economic crisis, proposing a new index for *participation finance* aiming to ground the financial economy in the real economy; rooted in Islamic banking, participation finance avoids highly speculative activities, which are seen as exploitative, looking to promote stability, transparency, and fairness.

### Risk-Based Assessment of Sustainability Credits

"Companies in industries with the biggest carbon footprints aren't reporting how their emissions feed into financial risk, according to an analysis of corporate reports by the Carbon Tracker Initiative." [@francesschwartzkopffFirmsArenReporting2022]

-   BeZero is innovating in the voluntary carbon credit market (VCM) by providing risk-scoring, a language financial professionals are accustomed with [@bezeroScalingCarbonMarkets2022; @tommyrickettsNavigatingNetZero2023]

### Indices: Certification From Sustainability Standards to B-Corporations

Companies assess customer's credit score to decide credit-worthiness, however inversely, how can customers rate companies? Indices make comparing companies possible. There are many-many indexes, scoring systems, ratings, certifications, etc.

Sustainability indices need transparency and standardization [@bolognesiMappingSustainableInvesting2024].

Based on Corporate Knights data [@corporateknightsGlobal1002024]

Energy productivity

```{python}
ck_energy_productivity()
```

Carbon productivity

```{python}
ck_carbon_productivity()
```

[@internationaltradecentreStandardsMap2022] currently lists 334 different sustainability standards: "Towards a meaningful economy" "The world's largest database for sustainability standards", "We provide free, accessible, comprehensive, verified and transparent information on over 300 standards for environmental protection, worker and labor rights, economic development, quality and food safety, as well as business ethics."

-   There are many standards.

-   Most sustainable companies. Make a database?

Research shows certification does matter. In Europe, consumers are willing to pay more for bio-based products *"72% of Europeans are willing to pay more for environmentally friendly products. The study identifies a "green premium" and a "certified green premium," indicating increased WTP for bio-based and certified bio-based products"* [@moroneConsumerWillingnessPay2021]. Particulary in Italy, a study of consumer awareness of sustainable supply chains shows Italian consumers have a strong preference for antibiotic-free meat [@mazzocchiConsumerAwarenessSustainable2022].

## ESG Crisis: Promise and Pitfalls

Countering Misinformation with Transparency

Since the 1970s, international bodies, governments, and private corporations have developed sustainability measurement metrics, the prominent one being ESG (Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance) developed by the UN in 2005. This rating system has already been implemented or is in the process of being adopted on stock markets all over the world and has implications beyond the stock markets, allowing analysts to measure companies' performance on the triple bottom line: the financial, social, and environmental metrics.

ESG gives banks a new tool to market and sell environmentally conscious opportunities to institutional investors, for example, universities - a case in point being the recent partnership between HSBC and the University of Edinburgh [@reidUniversityEdinburghGoes2020]. Another recent example is one of the largest private banks in Switzerland, Lombard Odier & Co, when they launched a thematic bio-economy fund inspired by the words of The Prince of Wales, 'Building a sustainable future is, in fact, the growth story of our time' [@jerseyeveningpostCharlesAchievingSustainable2020].

In Taiwan, the Taipei stock market has listed ESG stocks since 2017 and was hailed by Bloomberg as a regional leader in ESG reporting [@grauerTaiwanLeadingWay2017]. In December 2017, the *FTSE4Good TIP Taiwan ESG Index* was launched, which tracks ESG-rated companies on the Taipei stock market [@taiwanindexTIPTaiWanZhiShuGongSi2024]. Nasdaq Nordic introduced an ESG index in 2018, and Euronext, the largest stock market in Europe, introduced an ESG index and a series of derivative instruments in the summer of 2020 [@euronextEuronextLaunchesSuite2020].

[@ImportanceESGMeasurement2022] suggests ACWI ESG leaders outperform the non-ESG screened ACWI based on comparing MSCI indexes. It's notable that ACWI ESG starts to outperform the traditional ACWI only in the past few years.

```{python}
msci_esg_leaders()
```

-   Nordic Climate Transparency Leadership analysis of Nasdaq OMX Nordic 120 companies: *"companies with higher quality climate reporting also provide higher returns"*. In contrast, [@luoESGLiquidityStock2022] found firms with a lower ESG score are more profitable.
-   Trucost, a company launched in 2000 to calculate the hidden environmental costs of large corporations and advance circular-economy practices was acquired in 2016 by S&P Dow Jones Indices, which by 2019 became a part of its ESG product offering [@toffelTrucostValuingCorporate2011; @mikehowerTrucostTruValueLabs2015; @indicesDowJonesIndices2016; @RollsOutTrucost2019]. It's parent company S&P Global also acquired RobecoSAM’s ESG rating business, consolidating S&P's control of ESG ratings [@georgegeddesGlobalAcquiresRobecoSAM2019].

Sustainable Investing is Based on Data. Greenwashing is a large detractor from environmental action as it's difficult to know what is sustainable and what is not. Greenwashing Disturbs Sustainable Capital Allocation. Greenwashing erodes trust. Greenwashing has a negative Impact on Credibility.

The promise of ESG is to counter misinformation with transparency.

ESG companies don't emit less CO2 than non-ESG companies.. ESG Criticism "25 ESG ratings from three major providers (Moody's Analytics, MSCI Inc., and Refinitiv)" - *"well-rated companies do not emit significantly less carbon than those with lower scores."* [@amencGreenDilutionHow2023].

The lack of rigor is creating a backlash against ESG reporting.[@chenxiyuHowAICan2021] reports ESG is filled with greenwashing. @AntiESGCrusadeUS2023 several US states are introducing regulation for ESGs to curb greenwashing. @francesschwartzkopffEUExploresTighter2022 suggests the ESMA and EU has strengthened legislation to counter ESG greenwashing. @shashwatmohantyGreenPushGreenwash2022: "sustainable funds don't buy Zomato's ESG narrative". @bindmanESGFundsFunnel2024 reports large ESG funds managed by BlackRock and Vanguard are investing into JBS, a meat-packing company which is linked to deforestation of the Amazon rainforest through it's supply chain.

ESG Needs Standardisation of Methodologies. "Disparity between ESG methodologies was one of the key hurdles to finding the right sustainable strategy" [@margarytakirakosianMethodologiesAreAll2022].

A meta-review of 136 research articles discovered the following ESG-rating agencies.

[@popescuAreSRIFunds2023] shows SRI companies have a little bit smaller carbon footprint.

```{python}

```

-   ESG reports are very general and opaque. We need product-level analytics and reporting to be able to compare products.. ESG is filled with greenwashing. ESG is a really low bad. metrics and goals: ESG, SDGs, ESG risk. Q: Reflection on the ESG wave: Does a company that performs well in carbon reduction but whose products are harmful to health conform to the spirit of ESG? Sest ei saa ESG ja teisi mõõdikuid usaldada, crowdsourced mõõdikud. openesg.com/because you can't trust ESG [@aikmanESGDAOOut2022] !

Three frameworks for corporate to think about ESG compliance is to position their company on the MEET - EXCEED - LEAD scale based on the size, complexity and available resources of the company.

### Governance: Boards, Policy, and Investor Pressure

Governance is the “G that makes E and S happen.”

Governance drives social and environmental initiatives at companies.

MSCI research finds company boards severely lacking in climate experts; among the 164 large CO2 emitters benchmarks by the *Climate Action 100+* alliance [@climateaction100+Companies2023; @sommerWhoClimateExpert2024].

[@climateaction100+Companies2023] tracks large emitters around the world with combined market cap of \$10.3 Trillion USD.

A systematic meta-review of 153 research papers of ESG literature around the world reports the major determinants of high ESG performance are board member diversity, firm size, and CEO attributes [@martinyDeterminantsEnvironmentalSocial2024].

```{python}

Shareholders can leverage their numbers and join forces in order to affect the board members of large corporations. For example, the As Your Sow NGO aims to champion CSR through building coalitions of shareholders and taking legal action, including the Fossil Free Funds initiative which researches and rates funds' exposure to fossil fuels finance and its sister project Invest in Your Values rates retirement plans offered by employers (mostly US technology companies) [@asyousowFossilFreeFunds2024; @asyousowHomeInvestYour2024]

Majority of large emitters companies don't have climate experts [@climateaction100+Companies2023].

Most companies do not meet the criteria [@climateaction100+Companies2023].

Board diversity in the top 5 sustainable companies in 2024 based on Corporate Knights rankings [@corporateknightsGlobal1002024].

In the U.S. and European banking sector [@dicuonzoESGGovernanceVariables2024] performed an analysis of 180 banks' data. Fintech Index and ESG Scores have a positive correlation, suggesting the adoption of technology has a statistically significant influence on better environmental stewardship, social and governance quality. Even larger predictors of high ESG score were than were Board Gender Diversity (Women on Board), the Size of the Bank, and Board Independence (governance structures with more independent directors could be more socially and environmentally responsible). On the flip side, out of the initial 1551 banks considered the majority did not have ESG data available to be able to perform the comparison.

In China, [@luDoesEnvironmentalInformation2023] finds *digitization* is the pathway to Environmental Information Disclosure (EID) and Green Innovation.

### ESG Provides a Shared Language

ESG Becomes a Shared Language.

The advice consultancies are providing to banks establishes a common language and helps banks to sell strategical alignment for long-term institutional sustainability in terms of environmental, social, and governance performance. PWC suggests *"asset managers educate their staff and client base. 'It will be critical to build stronger ESG expertise among their employees by up-skilling existing staff on ESG principles and strategically scout for and integrate more diverse and ESG-trained talent'"* [@pwc2022GrowthOpportunity2020]

While ESG is riddled with problems, it has started a common language and there are many ways how to improve it

-   For AI-powered assistants to be able to provide guidance, metrics are needed to evaluate sustainable assets, and ESG provides the current state-of-the-art for this. The largest obstacle to eco-friendly investing is greenwashing where companies and governments try to portray an asset as green when in reality it's not. A personal investing assistant can provide an interface to focus on transparency, highlighting data sources and limitations, to help users feel in control of their investment decisions, and potentially even provide large-scale consumer feedback on negative practices back to the business through infringement discovery.

-   Other large university endowments, such as managed by Yale, Stanford and MIT are in decision gridlock\[\^6\]. Blackrock, the largest private investment fund in the world with \$10T USD under management, released guidance reflecting their plans to shift their investments to vehicles that are measured on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance \[\^7\]. However they later backtracked from their decision.

-   Banks are required by law to apply the principle of Know Your Customer (KYC).

-   It can be as mundane as choosing the next eco-friendly product instead of the polluting one we purchase in the supermarket make a difference? How to invest in the growth of companies that put ESG at the center of their activities instead of using it for greenwashing? Creating direct ties will improve ESG.

### ESG (Data Streams): Realtime Reporting

"\[T\]hanks to other emerging technology like IoT sensors (to collect ESG data) and blockchain (to track transactions), we have the infrastructure to collect more data, particularly for machine consumption. By measuring real-time energy usage, transportation routes, manufacturing waste, and so forth, we have more quantifiable ways to track corporations' environmental performance without relying purely on what they say." [@sahotaAIAnalysis8002021]

Google Environmental Insights Explorer enables local governments (cities) to measure CO2 emissions and enact environmental policies that optimize city functions such as traffic flows [@MethodologyGoogleEnvironmental; @nicolelombardoReducingCityTransport2021]

-   "But the real breakthrough is how we can surface that real-time ESG data directly to individuals in the shops and online, linked to the products that they are browsing and potentially buying. This means that ESG change will finally be driven by the ultimate judge of business success -- the customer." [@ratkovicLeadingWayRealTime2023]

How are large corporations responding to the climate crisis?

Lack of leadership. [@capgeminiWorldBalanceWhy2022]: "Many business leaders see sustainability as costly obligation rather than investment in the future".

The CEO of the Swedish clothing producer H&M - one of the largest fast-fashion in the world -, recognizes the potential impact of *conscious consumers* as a threat [@hoikkalaCEOSeesTerrible2019].

Many large businesses have tried to find solutions by launching climate-focused funding. [@korosecAmazonTaps2B2021] reports that Amazon's 2B USD to a Climate Pledge Fund earmarked to fix climate problems is invested in energy, logistics, and packaging startups, which will reduce material waste. "Good intentions don't work, mechanisms do," Amazon's founder Bezos is quoted as saying in [@cliffordHowThisPopular2022]. Walmart is taking a similar approach, having launched a project in 2017 to set CO~2~ reduction targets in collaboration with its suppliers [@walmartProjectGigaton2023]. These examples underline how money marketed as climate funding by retail conglomerates means focus on reducing operational cost of running their business through automation and material savings.

Large corporations such as Nestle and Coca Cola support the biodiversity law to have a level playing field for business [@greensefaNatureVoteSuccess2023].

### ESG (Social): Slavery Still Exists and Worsens Sustainability

In 2023, an estimated 50 million people were in slavery around the world; lack of supply chain visibility hides forced labor and exploitation of undocumented migrants in agricultural work; 71% of enslaved people are estimated to be women. [@kunzAdoptionTransferabilityJoint2023; @borrelliCareSupportMaternity2023]. [@christBlockchainTechnologyModern2021] estimates 20 million people are *'stuck inside corporate blockchains'*. The Global Slavery Index measures the considerable *'import risk'* of having slavery inside its imports [@walkfreeGlobalSlaveryIndex2023]. [@hansvanleeuwenModernSlaveryGrace2023] slavery affects industries from fashion to technology, including sustainability enablers such as solar panels. ILO estimates 236 billion USD are generated in illegal profits from forced labor [@internationallabourorganizationProfitsPovertyEconomics2024].

The Modern Slavery Act has been passed in several countries starting with the U.K. in 2015 [@ukparliamentModernSlaveryAct2024]. [@maiImpactUKModern2023] finds the quality of the reporting remains low among FTSE 100 (index of highly capitalized listings on the London Stock Exchange) companies.

On the global level, the United Nations SDG target 8.7 targets to eliminate all forms of slavery by 2025 however progress has been slow [@theminderoofoundationEradicatingModernSlavery2020].

Voters in Switzerland rejected the responsible business initiative in 2020 while the country is a global hub for trading commodities. "Switzerland has a hand in over 50% of the global trade in coffee and vegetable oils like palm oil as well as 35% of the global volume of cocoa, according to government estimates"[@anandchandrasekharWhySwitzerlandMatters2021] begging the question can Swiss traders have more scrutiny over what they trade?

```{python}

Slavery is connected to environmental degradation, and climate change [@deckersparksGrowingEvidenceInterconnections2021]. Enslaved people are used in environmental crimes such as 40% of deforestation globally. Cobalt used in technological products is in risk of being produced under forced labor in the D.R. Congo [@sovacoolWhenSubterraneanSlavery2021]. In India and Pakistan, forced labor in brick kiln farms is possible to capture remotely from satellite images [@boydSlaverySpaceDemonstrating2018]. In effect, the need for cheap labor turns slavery into a *subsidy* keeping environmental degradation happening.

### ESG (Social): How to Trace Worker's Rights

While reducing slavery in the supply chain sets very low bar for ESG, another aspect of supply tracing is the treatment of workers and working conditions.

-   "commodification of human beings"

-   Companies that intend to to give supply chain a voice" by connecting workers directly to the consumer (even in anonymously, to protect the workers from retribution), include *CTMFile* and *Alexandria*. \[@timnicolleRealtimeESGData2021 and @primadollarmediaPrimaDollarGivingSupply2021 PrimaDollar Realtime ESG Give supply chain a voice by connecting workers directly to the consumer.
