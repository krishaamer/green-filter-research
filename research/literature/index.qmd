## Sources and Literature Map

Given the goal of designing an app to integrate shopping, saving, and investing sustainably, the literature is quite broad. The literature review maps out relationships between sustainability and AI interaction design. The reviewed content consists of 3 main sources:

-   Scientific papers (largely from ScienceDirect) related to:

-   Sustainability, ecology, ecosystem services

-   Sustaimable investing, savings, circular economy

-   UX/UI, service design, sustainable design, speculative design, interaction design

-   Generation-Z demographics, behavior change, nudge

-   Review of Mobile apps (Apple iOS / Google Android) and web app related to:

-   Sustainable shopping apps, savings, and investing

-   Apps using algorithmic interfaces (AI-based UI)

-   EU legislation

In order to keep track more easily, each literature review section includes **design implications** in context.

The goal of the literature review is to find ideas of app features.
