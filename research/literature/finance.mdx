# Sustainable Finance

## The Journey from Consumer to Investor

Digital financial technologies (aka fintechs) enable new modes of
interaction design which increasingly blur boundaries between shopping,
saving, and investing, giving users exposure to investment opportunities
through familiar activities that may have the potential to boost
financial literacy and entice consumers to learn more about financial
markets. Shopping, saving, and investing are converging on the same
digital banking platforms, with features such as reward and cashback
programs (Rakuten), round-up to next dollar with automated
micro-investing (e.g. Acorn, Stash, Swedbank), and retail investing
(Robinhood, Public) and copy-trading (eToro) into various (fractional
shares of) stocks, derivatives like CFDs and futures, microloans (Kiva),
commodities and precious metals such as gold and silver (Revolut),
physical assets such as real estate, land, forest and digital assets
such as cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and other alternative assets.

Digital money in it’s various forms connects industries on the same
apps, which make investing more accessible and socially engaging,
appealing to younger people who are active in social media and online
shopping. Added to that the trend of sustainably, how can sustainability
become more accessible? People want to shop, save, and invest
sustainably - how to do it?

## The Democratization of Financial Markets

trend. good news.

### Legislation

-   PWC (2020) Changes to laws and regulations aimed at achieving
    climate change mitigation is a key driver behind the wave of ESG
    adoption. The goal of these laws, first adopted in the European
    Union, a self-proclaimed leader in eco-friendliness, is to pressure
    unsustainable companies to change towards greener practices, in fear
    of losing their access to future capital, and to create a mechanism
    forcing entire environmentally non-compliant business sectors to
    innovate towards sustainability unless they want to suffer from
    financial penalties. On the flip side of this stick and carrot
    fiscal strategy, ESG-compliant companies will have incentives to
    access to cheaper capital and larger investor demand from
    ESG-friendly investors.

-   House of Commons (2002): Already in 2001, the UK government was
    discussing ways to promote sustainable investment “fundamental
    changes in VAT or corporation taxes could be used to promote greener
    consumption and investment”.

-   European Parliament (2014) Directive 14 2014/65/EU, 2014: The
    European Union fully recognizes the changing financial landscape
    trending towards the democratization of investments: “more investors
    have become active in the financial markets and are offered an even
    more complex wide-ranging set of services and instruments”.

-   Kenton (2020): Some key legislation for investors has been put in
    place recently, for example “MiFID II is a legislative framework
    instituted by the European Union (EU) to regulate financial markets
    in the bloc and improve protections for investors”. European
    Securities and Markets Authority (2017): “MiFID II and MiFIR will
    ensure fairer, safer and more efficient markets and facilitate
    greater transparency for all participants”.

-   Anon (n.d.a) Taxonomy of sustainable activities in the UK

-   Anon (2023s)

-   Quinson (2020-08-31T17:00:13.652Z, 2020-08-31T17:00:13.652Z,
    2020-08-31T17:00:13.652Z) While the larger trend is for governments
    to adapt to and work towards their environmental climate commitments
    and public demand, the sovereign risk remains an issue. For example,
    the policies supported by U.S. President Trump during his presidency
    ran counter to many sustainability recommendations, including those
    directed at the financial markets. Helping legacy industries stay
    competitive for longer through subsidies, and lack of regulation, or
    even regulation supporting legacy technologies.

There’s literature suggesting it’s possible to make investments that
both make an attractive financial return and adhere to sustainability
goals. In housing development, there’s evidence of ‘green’ buildings
achieving a ‘higher financial return than conventional buildings, both
in terms of rent and sale price’ (Oyedokun (2017)). There’s also a trend
of investors looking for sustainability in addition to profits in a few
countries.

-   For example - In Sweden “Preferences for sustainable and responsible
    equity funds

-   Lagerkvist et al. (2020) undertook a choice experiment with Swedish
    private investors.

-   Smith (2019) suggests 74% of Chinese youth are looking for “positive
    impact”.

-   Lingeswaran (2019) suggest philanthropy is on the rise in Asia
    however Ho (2019) counters investors are not sure how to separate
    sustainable assets from less sustainable ones.

### Financial and Sustainability Literacy

Financial and Sustainability Literacy are intertwined.

How can finance enable/help/encourage sustainability?

### Sustainable Capital Allocation Methods

Shopping, saving and investing are forms of capital allocation. In one
way or another, we’re giving our money to companies that provide the
products and services we need. The critical question is: do we choose to
support sustainability-focused companies or those that pay less
attention to sustainability?

Money is created by governments by law: using central banks, which loan
money to commercial banks. New types of money is also created by
companies and individuals using cryptography on blockchain-based
distributed databases, which keep track of transactions (who-paid-whom).
Whatever the method of creation, in essence, money is a *system of
trust* where *something* is used as a *medium of value exchange* and
accepted by *other people* as payment.

### Increasing Number of Asset Classes

There are many asset classes only some of which would be accessible to a
retail investors.

-   The main categories of investment products are, based on the Anon
    (n.d.q)

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[0] }} />

*Thematic Capital,* Build a thematic portfolio. There’s a wide range of
investment products marketed as *sustainable*, however many of them are
fake (**CITATION**).

### Community Investing Enables Financial Inclusion

-   Inexperienced investor can copy other people when investing.
-   You don’t know how to invest? Build an investing community? Can
    follow others and raise capital together.
-   Savings in CO<sub>2</sub> Equivalent Emissions: CO<sub>2</sub>
    savings are the amount of CO2e reduction one manages to achieve by
    changing one’s behavior and influencing others (people, companies).
    While the individual footprint is so small, the largest reduction
    will come from influencing large groups of people, either by
    leadership, role-model, or other means.
-   In some ways community-investing competes with robo-advisors as
    communities can be led by professional investors and followed by
    less sophisticated investors. Investor communities can have the type
    of ***social proof***, which robo-advisor do not possess.

### Fintech

The user interface and user experience (UI/UX) of consumer-focused
investing apps in Europe has improved a over the past decade. The
changing landscape is related to the earlier availability of better
quality apps available in the US and the disappearance of the 1st
generation of investing apps and the lessons learned.

In the early days in Europe, Germany and the United Kingdom led the way
with the most robo-advisory usage (Cowan, 2018). While Germany had 30+
robot-advisors on the market in 2019, with a total of 3.9 billion EUR
under robotic management, it was far less than individual apps like
Betterment managed in the US (Bankinghub, 2019). Already in 2017,
several of the early robo-advisors apps have shut down in the UK (AltFi,
2017). ETFmatic gained the largest number of downloads by 2017, focusing
exclusively on exchange-traded funds (ETFs), tracking stock-market
indexes automatically, with much less sophistication, than their US
counterparts (AltFi, 2017). The app was bought by a bank in 2021 and

-   While the financial AI companion apps in the US market are ahead
    globally, they are not yet using many of the user experience
    innovations that are prevalent on social media platforms targeted at
    Generation Z and/or Millennials, possibly presenting an opportunity
    for cross-industry knowledge transfer, from businesses that are
    traditionally closer to the consumer - such as retailers. Financial
    AI companion apps have not yet grown to mainstream scale in Asia,
    Africa, Latin America, and Europe, being for the moment a largely
    US-based retail investor trend. The apps outside of the US are niche
    products in a nascent stage, however, they still provide relevant
    design directions or stories of what to avoid.

### Crypto

Brazilian (N=573 ) “Crypto investors in Brazil are generally younger,
male, and exhibit higher risk tolerance compared to non-crypto
investors.” Colombo & Yarovaya (2024) “Brazil’s planned adoption of CBDC
(Central Bank Digital Currency).” “It finds that risk tolerance,
economic pessimism, and a belief in better investment acumen are
significant predictors of crypto investment.”

Cryptocurrencies are the most popular financial action among young
people (ADD CITATION) yet in some ways crypto needs even more financial
literacy than traditional financial assets.

-   Centralized Crypto Exchanges are in essence lending assets from the
    user. “The piece of the settlement aimed at getting important
    information to customers is more understandable from a retail
    protection standpoint. Customers who lend crypto assets to a company
    in exchange for a promised return should get the information they
    need to assess the risks against the rewards” (Hester M. Peirce,
    2022).

-   Taiwan bans buying cryptocurrencies with credit card because the
    volatility makes it similar to gambling (David Attlee, 2022;

### DAOs

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) which have an investable
treasury may be compare to Hedge Funds as a collective form of
investing. Because of the on-chain nature where transactions are visible
to anyone, they may be seen as more transparent. Typically DAOs have a
voting system to make decision while Hedge Funds may be more centrally
controlled. Also, the legislation affecting each would be different as
hedge funds are an older and more established financial tool whereas
DAOs still fall in somewhat of a gray area.

### Oracles for Sustainability Data

Intersection with finance and Real World Data.

A data oracle is the concept of a source of real-world data which can be
ingested through an application programming interface (API) to a
blockchain system. There are many databases of sustainability
information which could serve as an oracle for carbon labeling,
packaging, transportation, consumption, and waste.

-   Ethereum (2023)

-   Caldarelli, Rossignoli & Zardini (2020) notes it’s a challenge to
    ensure the accuracy and trustworthiness of real-world data from
    Oracles.

## The Gargantuan Eco-Investment Gap

bad news.

How Much Money Is Needed?

It would be easier for large institutional investors to move their money
to sustainable assets than for retail investors to move their relatively
small investments.

Sustainability lacks Trillions of USD in investment - even with massive
financing going into sustainability, there’s still a lack of investing.
The estimate for the global *financing gap* for low-carbon energy
production was 5.2 Trillion USD as of 2016 (Anon, 2016; Earth Day,
2023). A newer United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) calculation
lowered the world needs an additional **4.1 Trillion USD** of financing
in nature-based solutions by 2050 to meet climate change, biodiversity,
and land degradation reduction targets (UNEP, 2022). According to (The
Rockefeller Foundation, 2022) a slightly lower **2.5-3.2 Trillion USD**
would be sufficient.

The needed investment doesn’t seem so large - around 2.5-5.2 % of the
global GDP - if one compares it to the *per year* Global Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) estimated at around 100 Trillion USD in 2022 and growing
to 105 Trillion USD in 2023 (Aaron O’Neill, 2023; International Monetary
Fund, 2023). In essence, the estimated total investment gap in climate
fits into the economic growth of 1 year of the global economy.

“Sustainable development requires more investment in sustainable
companies and less in unsustainable firms.” (Van Zanten & Rein, 2023).

Invetors’ belief in sustainable investing is affected by other investors
(Luz, Schauer & Viehweger, 2024).

What if 10% of annual consumer spending – *ten percent is about
\$2,8T* - went towards protecting our climate?

The theme for the 2023 Earth Day was *“Invest In Our Planet”*.

The lack of funding in green energy especially affects emerging
economies (Anon, 2022c). *“We can and must channel private capital into
nature-based solutions. This will require policy and regulatory support,
catalytic capital and financial innovation”* argued the CEO Green
Finance Institute, Dr Rhian-Mari Thomas, ahead of COP27 in Egypt (Anon,
2023g). It’s not happening fast enough.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[1] }} />

While these assets and GDP values reflect different aspects of the
global economy, the comparison illustrates that redirecting a relatively
small fraction of global wealth and economic activity towards
sustainable investments can close the investment gap. This perspective
should inspire confidence that the goal is achievable with coordinated
effort and policy support.

-   Robeco survey of 300 large global investors totaling \$27T under
    management found biodiversity-protection is increasingly a
    focus-point of capital allocation (Robeco, 2023).

-   Ray Dalio puts the needed climate investment at \$5T yet believes
    these financial goals won’t be met Ray Dalio (2023)

-   – compliance and GenAI in banking: (Rahul Agarwal et al., 2024).

    – “Lessons from banking to improve risk and compliance and speed up
    digital transformations” (Jim Boehm et al., 2021).

## The Economics of Decoupling Growth from Environmental Degradation

Eco-economic decoupling

### New Metrics

The first two decades of the 21st century have seen increasing economic
thinking, looking to challenge, improve or upgrade capitalism to match
our current environmental, social, and technological situation, often
called *New Economics.* Some of these include behavioral economics,
sustainable capitalism, regenerative capitalism, doughnut economics,
ecological economics, blue economy, degrowth, attention economy, gift
economy, intent economy, among others. There’s no lack of published
books on changing capitalism, which goes to show there’s readership for
these ideas. Build a new economic theory is out of scope for my thesis
design, however I’ll focus on the parts of economic theory I believe are
relevant for *interaction design*-ing for sustainability.

There are those looking for *new metrics*. One of the first innovators,
already in 1972, was Buthan, with the *Gross National Happiness Index
(GNH)*, which in turn inspired the UN, decades later, in 2012, to create
the International Wellbeing and Happiness Conference and the
International Happiness Day(Ribeiro & Lemos Marinho, 2017; Kamei et al.,
2021). The Wellbeing Economy Alliance (WEAll) countries (New Zealand,
Iceland, Finland, Scotland, Wales) as well as the EU and Canada, started
the coalition in 2018 (Ellsmoor, 2019; David Suzuki Foundation, 2021;
CEPR, 2022; Scottish Government, 2022; Wellbeing Economy Alliance,
2022). The World Bank talks about the comprehensive GDD+ metrics in its
Changing the Wealth of Nations report (World Bank, 2021). Giacalone,
Mattera & Nissi (2022) looks at wellbeing of Italian communities and
proposes a new composite index. The award-winning economist Mariana
Mazzucato argues in Gupta (2020) we have to include more into how we
value unpaid labor, relating to the social (S in ESG) (Mazzucato, 2018).

*Econometrics* is the science and art of measuring the economy. The
creator of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) metric in 1934 Simon Kuznets
said: “The welfare of a nation can scarcely be inferred from a
measurement of national income as defined by GDP…Goals for ‘more’ growth
should specify of what and for what” (United States. Bureau of Foreign
and Domestic Commerce, Seventy-Third Congress & Kuznets, Simon, 1934).
GDP was the culmination of previous work by many authors, beginning with
William Petty in the 17th century Rockoff (2020). This long journey
underlines how a metric about a complex system such as the economy is
continuous work in progress. There has been ongoing work to create
improved metrics such as the the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),
Human Development Index (HDI), Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), Green
GDP, Inclusive Wealth Index, and others (Bleys & Whitby, 2015; Kovacic &
Giampietro, 2015; Anielski, 2001). Measuring wellbeing in addition to
GDP and the metric should including resiliency dashboards, to to
visualize metrics beyond GDP and they are an integral part of country
reports (GreensEFA, 2023). Similarly, the doughnut (donut) economics
(more below) model calls for a “dashboard of indicators” (TED, 2018).

*Ecological Economics* is the prime suspect for eco-conscious ideas to
incorporate into design, drawing attention to the interdependence of
economy and the ecosystem; there are physical limits to economic growth
on a planet with finite resources. The founder of the field Herman Daly
was talking about *prosperity without growth* more than two decades ago,
focusing on the diminishing natural resources (Daly, 1997). (Jackson,
2009, 2017) expanded on these ideas with recipes for a post-growth
world, making the ideas seem more tangible and precise.

-   Sacred Economics is use as-is as a framework and visualization tool.

### Doughnut Economics

The doughnut (donut) is a simple visualization that helps to grasp the
big picture of the economy and the physical and social worlds. It allows
one to see the social shortfall and ecological overshoot of nations at
the same time (Fanning et al., 2021). Doughnut Economics has not been
implemented on a country–level however has inspired cities to take a
comprehensive view of the doughnut of their own city.

Several EU cities have adopted the vision (Jordan G. Teicher, 2021).
Doughnut in Brussels, Belgium. Everything has to be adapted to the place
and context (Oikos Denktank, 2021; BrusselsDonut, 2022). The city of
Amsterdam is developing shorter food chains (which save CO<sub>2</sub>)
and linking residents with food production and reconnecting people to
the food. Food become a sort of ***social object***, which foster
collaboration in the community (Circle Economy, 2021). Amsterdam also
has a Circular Economy Monitor which makes it easy for anyone to see the
progress being made towards the Dutch goal to be a circular economy by
2050 (Waterstaat, 2019; Gemeente Amsterdam, 2022).

The Doughnut concept is a useful social object that’s simple and deep at
the same time, enabling starting conversations with people from all
walks of life, independent of their politics leanings. As Raworth calls
it, it’s a ***“self-portrait of humanity in the beginning of the 21st
century”.*** Combining the SDGs inside the doughnut and the Planetary
Boundaries outside the doughnut. The space donut represents a state of
equilibrium and balance on spaceship Earth.

-   Kate Raworth was inspired by ecological economics among other
    things.
-   Bailey & Eggereide (2020) shows how the Norwegian government plans
    to increase salmon production 5x by 2050. How can this be
    sustainable?

### Debating Decoupling Economic Growth from CO2 Emissions

New economic thinkers are asking how can economic growth and
sustainability be compatible. Some even ask if *economic growth* itself
is the wrong goal? (Diduch, 2020). Degrowth is the most famous contender
in that branch of economics. Is Decoupling Economic Growth and CO2e
Emissions Possible? Is Green Growth an oxymoron? No-one knows as it
hasn’t been done before. Degrowth proponents are pessimistic it’s
possible to decouple greenhouse gas emissions from economic growth;
historical data shows does not show any decoupling. Some data from China
shows decoupling?

-   (Keyßer & Lenzen, 2021) provides several scenarios for low, medium,
    and high levels of decoupling.

-   (harrisson, 2019) concludes UK’s CO2e emissions have fallen 43% from
    1990 to 2017 through the use of less carbon-intensive energy sources
    and argues for moderate policies in (Hausfather & Peters, 2020).
    Meanwhile (Global Carbon Budget, 2023) data shows an increasing CO2e
    emissions trend in the UK in the same timeframe.

-   Trucost, a company launched in 2000 to calculate the hidden
    environmental costs of large corporations and advance
    circular-economy practices was acquired in 2016 by S&P Dow Jones
    Indices, which by 2019 became a part of its ESG product offering
    (Toffel & Sice, 2011; Mike Hower, Dec 9, 2015 7am EST; Indices, Oct
    03, 2016, 08:30 ET; Anon, 2019c). It’s parent company S&P Global
    also acquired RobecoSAM’s ESG rating business, consolidating S&P’s
    control of ESG ratings (George Geddes, 2019).

-   (Trucost & TEEB for Business Coalition, 2023) finds the value of
    unpriced externalities which are not included in the GDP is 7.3
    trillion USD per year.

-   The Progress Principle is a term coined by Teresa Amabile and Steven
    Kramer, says people like to see the number go up. Amabile & Kramer

-   In *intent economics*, could I define what are my expectations
    towards companies, before I engage in any transactions Searls
    (2012). Old-school businesses only expect me to spend money but I
    have so many more concerns. I’m human. I’m not just a piece of
    currency.

-   In the context of this study, is it possible to make financial
    decisions that follow our guidelines and preferences but without
    moment-to-moment involvement needed so as to save up our precious
    time?

## Shopping

### Payments are an Entry Point and Source of Consumer Action Data

-   Shopping Data
-   From Payments to Investing
-   The combination of consumption and investment is an access point to
    get the consumer thinking about investing. Even if the amount are
    small, they are a starting point for a thought process.
-   Payments is the primary way consumers use money.
-   Payments is one way consumers can take individual climate action. In
    the words of a Canadian investment blogger, “every dollar you spend
    or invest is a vote for the companies and their ethical and
    sustainability practices” (Fotheringham, 2017).
-   M-Pesa in Kenya since 2007 for mobile payments, used by more than
    80% of farmers (Tyce, 2020; Parlasca, Johnen & Qaim, 2022). Using
    digital payments instead of cash enables a new class of experiences,
    in terms of personalization, and potentially, for sustainability.
    Asian markets have shown the fastest growth in the use of digital
    payments (McKinsey, 2020).
-   In Sweden point of sales (PoS) lending is a common practice, and one
    of the reasons for the success of Klarna, the Swedish banking
    startup, which has managed to lend money to more consumers than
    ever, through this improved user experience.
-   Taking out loans for consumption is a questionable personal
    financial strategy at best. If people can loan money at the point of
    sales, why couldn’t there be 180 degrees opposite service - point of
    sales investing?
-   A Dutch fintech company Bunq offers payment cards for
    sustainability, provided by MasterCard, which connects everyday
    payments to green projects, such as planting trees and donations to
    charities within the same user interface (Bunq, 2020). Sharing a
    similar goal to Alibaba’s Ant Forest, Bunq’s approach creates a new
    interaction dynamic in a familiar context (card payments), enabling
    customers to effortlessly contribute to sustainability. However, it
    lacks the level of gamification which makes Alibaba’s offering so
    addictive, while also not differentiating between the types of
    purchases the consumer makes, in terms of the level of
    eco-friendliness.

    amount of cash that can be withdrawn from ATMs. “In Nigeria’s
    largely informal economy, cash outside banks represents 85% of
    currency in circulation and almost 40 million adults are without a
    bank account.”

### Banks and Fintechs Capture User Data

Banks have access to each person’s financial habits which makes it
possible to model sustainable behavior using big data analysis. Taiwan’s
O Bank makes use of Mastercard’s data to calculate each transaction’s
CO<sub>2</sub> emissions(Anon, 2022d).

-   Banks have started offering a service to automatically save and
    invest tiny amounts of money collected from shopping expenses. Every
    purchase one makes contributes a small percentage - usually rounded
    up to the nearest whole number - to one’s investment accounts. For
    example, Swedbank (2022), the leading bank in the Estonian market,
    offers a savings service where everyday payments made with one’s
    debit card are rounded up to the next Euro, and this amount is
    transferred to a separate savings account. Similarly, the Estonian
    bank LHV (2020) offers micro-investing and micro-savings services,
    with an interesting user experience innovation showing how for an
    average Estonian means additional savings of about 400€ per year.

-   While the financial industry is highly digitized, plenty of banks
    are still paper-oriented, running digital and offline processes
    simultaneously, making them slower and less competitive, than
    startups. Indeed, the new baseline for customer-facing finance is
    set by fintech, taking cues from the successful mobile apps in a
    variety of sectors, foregoing physical offices, and focusing on
    offering the best possible online experience for a specific
    financial service, such as payments.

-   fundamental analysis such as the Piotroski F-score is not effective
    for startups because of high capital burn rates.

Banks and Fintech are becoming more similar than ever.

-   39% of Millenials are willing to leave their bank for a better
    fintech (n=4,282); innovation in payments helps retention (PYMNTS,
    2023).

-   The European Central Bank describes fintech as improving the user
    experience across the board, making interactions more convenient,
    user-friendly, cheaper, and faster. “Fintech has had a more
    pronounced impact in the payments market \[…\] where the incumbents
    have accumulated the most glaring shortcomings, often resulting in
    inefficient and overpriced products,” Yves Mersch, Member of the
    Executive Board of the ECB says in European Central Bank (2019).

-   There are far too many ***neobanks***, or challenger banks to list.

### Consumer Activism

*Conscious consumers* make up a small percentage of the entire consumer
public. (Milne, Villarroel Ordenes & Kaplan, 2020) coins the term
*mindful consumers*, who do research and are aware of the impact of
their shopping choices.

### Sustainable Shopping

### *Loyalty Schemes*

help consumers save money and business increase repeat business.
Building customer loyalty is a key part of repeat business and financial
predictability for any company. Large consumer brands like Starbucks
have for long ran successful rewards programs that encourage customers
to come back (Steinhoff & Zondag, 2021). Could loyalty schemes create a
pathway to investing in the company to a strengthen the feeling of
connection with the business even further? After all, I’m now a minority
owner! Yet in practice, many consumers lack the financial literacy for
investing and there are many legislative difficulties for turning
loyalty points into investments. It’s easier instead to create a
separate cryptocurrency or token program which users could collect and
redeem for some benefit.

Saving Precedes Investing

There are two ways to look at sustainable savings and this chapter is
going to look at both of them. 1) Savings in CO2e emissions 2) Savings
in the financial sense of the word.

-   Pension funds are some of the largest asset holders and choosing
    where to invest one’s pension can be a sustainable financial action.

-   College students might not have a pension fund yet.

-   Bank inside of Whatsapp for the underbanked gig workers in Latin
    America: https://www.kontigo.lat/

## Investing

-   From building loyalty to building ownership, the first step is to
    start saving money to invest. How to encourage savings in daily life
    and make it a part of the everyday payments experience? Even
    starting with a small step, gathering a small target amount per
    month for savings, has the potential to shift the user’s way of
    thinking about money. The second step, choosing where to invest
    these savings, will help us begin thinking like an investor. To
    start noticing trends and looking into how finance shapes the world.

-   The As Your Sow NGO aims to champion CSR through building coalitions
    of shareholders and taking legal action, including the Fossil Free
    Funds initative which researches and rates funds’ exposure to fossil
    fuels finance and its sister project Invest in Your Values rates
    retirement plans offered by employers (mostly US technology
    companies) (As You Sow, 2024a, 2024b)

-   Burkart (2022)

-   Savings and Investing are conflate into the same chapter because the
    large majority of savings that people have are invested by their
    banks. Thus the question of *sustainable savings* comes one of where
    exactly are they invested and what is the impact of that investment
    of sustainability.

-   Assumptions: — where to put money makes a difference to
    sustainability. i.e. it matters what we buy, what we save, and where
    we invest

-   Investing is a stronger signal to business than interactions on
    social media. Design Stakeholder capitalism. In future company every
    company should get a sustainability plan. this can be a push in that
    direction if companies with a sustainability plan become more
    competitive because of higher consumer demand.

-   Hypothesis?

-   Savings are the money one has in a pension fund or managed by
    themselves. For the majority of people, savings are invested by the
    bank and make up the largest proportion on investments for the
    people who are not active investors themselves.

Young investors are typically ***retail investors*** investing small
amounts of money for themselves. (Unless they work in an institution
such as an investment firm, university endowment, pension fund or mutual
fund, and have a say in where to invest large amounts of other peoples’
money.)

Retail investors face many challenges in comparison with their
institutional counterparts. For instance, they may have much less time
to do proper research, face information asymmetries, where finding good
information is limited by time, ability, as well as financial literacy,
whereas professional investors have the tools, skills, time, and
knowledge, to make better investment decisions.

-   Investing is a fundamentally hopeful act. It means I think there’s a
    future. Specifically, ‘green investing’ is investing in the future
    of our planet - but can we trust the sustainability practices the
    ‘green’ investment vehicles aggregate, promising to have a positive
    impact? For example, the European Union for many years counted
    biomass as ‘green’ energy, even while forestry companies were
    cutting down trees to produce the biomass - the regulation was not
    specific enough to curb this practice. So, in effect, a ‘green
    investor’ might be supporting deforestation. How can an easy-to-use
    investment app address such complexities without alienating the
    users?

-   The world will be very different in 30 years - it’s time to invest
    in services that make our societies resilient, able to robustly
    respond to rapid change. Research and product development go
    hand-in-hand; the outcome of this study can provide insights for new
    financial product and service development. Related to SDG 9: “Build
    resilient infrastructure, promote sustainable industrialization and
    foster innovation”. The complexity of the situation offers an
    opportunity for design to make it understandable for humans

-   In 2021 the Estonian government decided to free up mandatory
    retirement savings so people can exercise their own judgment on how
    to invest (or spend it). Financial analysts are worried the Estonian
    population will spend their retirement savings right away - instead
    of investing.

### Indices

Sustainability indices need transparency and standardization (Bolognesi
et al., 2024).

### Personalized Investing

-   2022 saw a wave of new platforms aiming to make investing easier for
    retail investors

-   One example is Revolut, which expanded from a simple payments app to
    support varied saving and investment types (Anon, 2023n) and (Anon,
    2023h).

-   Twitter (now X) is becoming a financial app.

-   Inspiration from WeChat.

-   Nerdwallet’s Tommy Tindall (2023) suggests making financial
    commitments instead of resolutions.

-   How can the mobile devices which the majority of us are carrying
    with us every day, help us make decisions about the businesses we
    engage with? In terms of user experience, can personalized AI
    advisors empower our financial actions from shopping to saving and
    investing?

### Retail Investing is Financial Inclusion

*Retail Investing* can be seen as a form of financial inclusion. Ant
Group’s CEO Eric Jing says in Turrin (2021): *“The financial system of
the past 200 years was designed for the industrial era and served only
20% of the population and organizations. As we enter the digital age, we
must better serve the remaining 80%”.*

-   Tan (2020) proposes *“financial ecologies”* to understand the
    dynamic relationships between various actors: investors, advisors,
    government, where the government plays an active role in growing
    financial inclusion and responsible financial management. However,
    the paper further suggests that current robo-advisors (available in
    Singapore) make the investor captive to the agency of AI, making the
    person lose agency over their financial decisions.

    meet environmental, social, and governance targets. A Bloomberg News
    analysis found those goals are weak”

-   (Priscila Azevedo Rocha, Akshat Rathi & Todd Gillespie, 2022)
    suggests *“So far, most ESG investing is in the stock market. But
    the the \$22 trillion corporate bond market, where mature global
    companies such as Chanel go to borrow money from investors, has a
    particularly powerful role to play. Companies rely on debt much more
    than they do on stocks.”*

    looking for green bond certification to reduce yield spread, meaning
    the price of the green bond is becoming more similar to the price of
    a ‘regular’ bond (Li, Zhang & Wang, 2022).

-   Chinese *green bond market* is growing fast (Peng & Xiong, 2022).

### Hedge Funds

    *smart contracts* make it possible to create decentralized
    organizations which pool member resources for investing.

### Green Investment Platforms

Such as “green shops” there are green investing platforms, green ETFs,
etc. All of these are essentially forms of branding designed to make it
easier for investors to find an investing product they trust.

There are many ‘green investment platforms’ who to trust?

### Divesting

-   The inverse of investing.
-   In institutional finance, the Norwegian \$1.3T USD sovereign wealth
    fund (the world’s largest, followed by China)\[^5\] started a
    divestment trend in 2016 by divesting from coal. Their plan to reach
    net zero CO2e nonetheless only targets 2050. Furthermore, who would
    be the counterpart for such large transactions? The fund also
    announced divesting from Russia after its invasion of Ukraine,
    however has yet to sell any shares citing lack of buyers on the
    Moscow stock market. University of California also followed suit
    with divestment of its \$126B USD portfolio from oil and gas.

## Benchmarks

### Indexes

Indexes Enable Comparing Companies. Indexes make comparison possible.
There are many-many Indexes, Scoring Systems, Ratings, Certifications,
etc.

    how can customers rate companies.
-   ESG Shopping: “Changing our relationship with money”
-   Nordic Climate Transparency Leadership: “companies with higher
    quality climate reporting also provide higher returns”

### *Certification*

Does certification matter? Consumers are willing to pay more for
bio-based products “72% of Europeans are willing to pay more for
environmentally friendly products. The study identifies a”green premium”
and a “certified green premium,” indicating increased WTP for bio-based
and certified bio-based products.” Morone et al. (2021) (need access)

### ESG Crisis

-   ESG greenwashing Baldi & Pandimiglio (2022)

ESG Needs Standardisation

-   Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG)

-   Since the 1970s, international bodies, governments, and private
    corporations have developed sustainability measurement metrics, the
    prominent one being ESG (Environmental, Social, and Corporate
    Governance) developed by the UN in 2005. This rating system has
    already been implemented or is in the process of being adopted on
    stock markets all over the world and has implications beyond the
    stock markets, allowing analysts to measure companies’ performance
    on the triple bottom line: the financial, social, and environmental
    metrics.

-   In Taiwan, the Taipei stock market has listed ESG stocks since 2017
    and was hailed by Bloomberg as a regional leader in ESG reporting
    (Grauer, 2017), while Nasdaq Nordic introduced an ESG index in 2018,
    and Euronext, the largest stock market in Europe, introduced an ESG
    index and a series of derivative instruments in the summer of 2020
    (Euronext (2020)).

-   Doorn (2020): Many ecologically focused funds with different
    approaches have been launched in recent years, with variations in
    asset mix and style of management. Thematic asset management is
    expected to grow, with investors packaging opportunities based on
    consumer trends.

    bio-economy, even using tactics such as co-branding with famous
    individuals.

-   Jersey Evening Post (2020) A recent example is one of the largest
    private banks in Switzerland, Lombard Odier & Co, when they launched
    a thematic bio-economy fund inspired by the words of The Prince of
    Wales, ‘Building a sustainable future is, in fact, the growth story
    of our time’.

-   Reid (2020) ESG gives banks a new tool to market and sell
    environmentally conscious opportunities to institutional investors,
    for example, universities - a case in point being the recent
    partnership between HSBC and the University of Edinburgh.

-   PWC (2020) PWC suggests “asset managers educate their staff and
    client base. ‘It will be critical to build stronger ESG expertise
    among their employees by up-skilling existing staff on ESG
    principles and strategically scout for and integrate more diverse
    and ESG-trained talent’”.

-   The advice consultancies are providing to banks establishes a common
    language and helps banks to sell strategical alignment for long-term
    institutional sustainability in terms of finance, social, and
    governance.

-   For AI-powered assistants to be able to provide guidance, metrics
    are needed to evaluate sustainable assets, and ESG provides the
    current state-of-the-art for this. The largest obstacle to
    eco-friendly investing is greenwashing where companies and
    governments try to portray an asset as green when in reality it’s
    not. A personal investing assistant can provide an interface to
    focus on transparency, highlighting data sources and limitations, to
    help users feel in control of their investment decisions, and
    potentially even provide large-scale consumer feedback on negative
    practices back to the business through infringement discovery.

### Greenwashing Disturbs Sustainable Capital Allocation

Greenwashing is one of the largest blockers of sustainability; humans
will feel as if choosing green is useless and give up. Both the European
Commission and the Chair of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) Gary Gensler have called for more legislation to curb business
greenwashing practices. *“If it’s easy to tell if milk is fat-free by
just looking at the nutrition label, it might be time to make it easier
to tell if”green” or “sustainable” funds are really what they say they
are.”* says Gensler (US Securities and Exchange Commission, 2022).

### Sustainable Investing is Based on Data

Sustainabile investing is firstly about changes in legislation which set
stricter sustainability standards on companies. Secondly, increased
transparency, new metrics, and new tools make it feasible to
differentiate more sustainable companies from less sustainable ones.

Upcoming EU greenwashing legislation hopes to curb misleading
communications by companies. Until new legislation is in place (2030 in
the EU), consumer awareness is crucial as currently most
emission-reduction programs are voluntary and thus affected only by
consumer demand (André & Valenciano-Salazar, 2022).

-   Greenwashing is widespread in company social media communications
    (Geoffrey Supran, 2022). ClimateBert AI finds rampant greenwashing
    (Bingler, Kraus & Leippold, 2021; Sahota, 2021).

-   For example Purkiss et al. (2022) highlights the confusion between
    compostable and biodegradable plastics and public misunderstanding
    what happens to these plastics when they reach the landfill:
    “\[m\]ost plastics marketed as”home compostable” don’t actually
    work, with as much as 60% failing to disintegrate after six months”.

-   Napper & Thompson (2019): Shopping bags marketed as *biodegradable*
    don’t show deterioration after 3 years in salt-water sea environment
    ..

-   Yu (2021) ESG is filled with greenwashing. Anon (2023a) several US
    states are introducing regulation for ESGs to curb greenwashing.
    Frances Schwartzkopff (2022a) suggests the ESMA and EU has
    strengthened legislation to counter ESG greenwashing.

-   Greenwashing is a large detractor from environmental action as it’s
    difficult to know what is sustainable and what is not.

-   Green investing only makes sense if it’s possible to distinguish
    sustainable investments from not sustainable ones.

-   Sahota (2021): “thanks to other emerging technology like IoT sensors
    (to collect ESG data) and blockchain (to track transactions), we
    have the infrastructure to collect more data, particularly for
    machine consumption. By measuring real-time energy usage,
    transportation routes, manufacturing waste, and so forth, we have
    more quantifiable ways to track corporations’ environmental
    performance without relying purely on what they say.”

-   Frédéric Simon (2020) and Kira Taylor (2021): While the EU has
    proposed legislation to curb greenwashing, EU climate policy itself
    has been criticized for greenwashing. Sometimes greenwashing comes
    under legislative protection. Booth (2022) describes how “A recent
    investigation shows illegal logging of protected areas in eastern
    European countries that supplies residential wood pellets in Italy.
    Belgium, Denmark, and the Netherlands are importing pellets from
    Estonia, where protected areas are logged for pellets and the
    country has lost its forest carbon sink, despite large-scale wood
    pellet plants being certified ‘sustainable’ by the Sustainable
    Biomass Program”. A number of new AI-based tools aim to find
    instances of greenwashing.

### Realtime ESG

There’s a growing number of companies helping businesses to measure CO2e
emissions in their product lifecycle.

    greenwash”, “supply chain is a significant source of ESG content”

-   Automate CO<sub>2</sub> calculations realtime:

-   People working at the factories can report conditions

-   Anon (n.d.g): “But the real breakthrough is how we can surface that
    real-time ESG data directly to individuals in the shops and online,
    linked to the products that they are browsing and potentially
    buying. This means that ESG change will finally be driven by the
    ultimate judge of business success – the customer.”

### Governance or Corporate Responsibility

How are large corporations responding to the climate crisis?

Lack of leadership. (Capgemini, 2022): “Many business leaders see
sustainability as costly obligation rather than investment in the
future”.

The CEO of the Swedish clothing producer H&M - one of the largest
fast-fashion in the world -, recognizes the potential impact of
*conscious consumers* as a threat (Hoikkala, 2019).

Many large businesses have tried to find solutions by launching
climate-focused funding. (Korosec, 2021) reports that Amazon’s 2B USD to
a Climate Pledge Fund earmarked to fix climate problems is invested in
energy, logistics, and packaging startups, which will reduce material
waste. “Good intentions don’t work, mechanisms do,” Amazon’s founder
Bezos is quoted as saying in (Clifford, 2022). Walmart is taking a
similar approach, having launched a project in 2017 to set
CO<sub>2</sub> reduction targets in collaboration with its suppliers
Walmart (2023). These examples underlines how money marketed as climate
funding by retail conglomerates means focus on reducing operational cost
of running their business through automation and material savings.

Large corporations such as Nestle and Coca Cola support the biodiversity
law to have a level playing field for business (Greens EFA, 2023).

-   Anon (2013)

-   Guidotti (2015)

-   “Sustainability is important for many reasons including:
    Environmental Quality – In order to have healthy communities, we
    need clean air, natural resources, and a nontoxic environment.”

-   Low, Baum & Sovacool (2022) finds considerable uncertainty exists
    among experts which CO2 reduction methods among nature-based and
    technology-based are the most effective.

### Slavery Still Exists and How to Trace Worker’s Rights?

In 2023, an estimated 50 million people are still in slavery around the
world; lack of supply chain visibility hides forced labor and
exploitation of undocumented migrants in agricultural work; 71% of
enslaved people are estimated to be women. (Kunz et al., 2023; Borrelli
et al., 2023).

The UN SDG target 8.7 targets to eliminate all forms of slavery.

Slavery is connected to environmental degradation and climate change
(Decker Sparks et al., 2021). Enslaved people are used in environmental
crimes such as 40% of deforestation globally. Cobalt used in
technological products is in risk of being produced under forced labor
in the D.R. Congo (Sovacool, 2021). In India and Pakistan, forced labor
in brick kiln farms is possible to capture remotely from satellite
images (Boyd et al., 2018). In effect, the need for cheap labor turns
slavery into a *subsidy* keeping environmental degradation happening.

-   Christ & V Helliar (2021) estimates 20 million people are stuck
    inside corporate blockchains. The Global Slavery Index measures the
    ***Import Risk*** of having slavery inside its imports Walk Free
    (2023).

-   Hans van Leeuwen (2023) slavery affects industries from fashion to
    technology, including sustainability enablers such as solar panels.

-   “commodification of human beings”

-   Anand Chandrasekhar & Andreas Gefe (2021): Trading commodities
    “Switzerland has a hand in over 50% of the global trade in coffee
    and vegetable oils like palm oil as well as 35% of the global volume
    of cocoa, according to government estimates.” Can traders have more
    scrutiny over what they trade?

-   Modern Slavery Act.

-   Another aspect of supply tracing is the treatment of workers and
    working conditions. Companies that intend to to give supply chain a
    voice” by connecting workers directly to the consumer (even in
    anonymously, to protect the workers from retribution), include
    *CTMFile* and *Alexandria*.
