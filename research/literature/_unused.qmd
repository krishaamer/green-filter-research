In August 2021, Chris Sacca launched four climate‐tech funds under Lowercarbon Capital with $800 million in committed capital to back early‐stage decarbonization startups, arguing that timely venture risk capital is critical for scaling innovative carbon‐removal solutions . By 2023, Lowercarbon Capital had expanded its fund to €1.5 billion, aiming for roughly 30 new climate‐tech investments per year—from Pre‐Seed to Series B+—and focusing on both engineered (e.g., direct‐air capture) and nature‐based (e.g., regenerative agriculture) removal approaches that marry rigorous science with scalable business models .

-   What is Personalized AI?

While the financial AI companion apps in the US market are ahead globally, they are not yet using many of the user experience innovations that are prevalent on social media platforms targeted at Gen-Z and/or Millennials, possibly presenting an opportunity for cross-industry knowledge transfer, from businesses that are traditionally closer to the consumer - such as retailers. Financial AI companion apps have not yet grown to mainstream scale in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Europe, being for the moment a largely US-based retail investor trend. The apps outside of the US are niche products in a nascent stage, however, they still provide relevant design directions or stories of what to avoid. The user interface and user experience (UI/UX) of consumer-focused investing apps in Europe has improved a over the past decade. The changing landscape is related to the earlier availability of better quality apps available in the US and the disappearance of the 1st generation of rudimentary investing apps and the lessons learned on how to automate the delivery of financial services while increasing user satisfaction.
