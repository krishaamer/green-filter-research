-   Europe is transforming into a hotbed of sustainability. One of the EU goals is reducing careless consumption. Tacking our consumption habits can help support eco-designed products. It's up to legislators to provide sustainable products on our marketplace... but until this happens, we can use the green filter.

I like this quote. For me it's like the Helsinki chapel in Finland. It doesn't require one to be religious. There's either a priest or a social worker present. It's the perfect public service.  It limits the barrier of entry for people to discover quietness. Elegant.

-   [@akshatrathiChrisSaccaReturns2021; @lowercarboncapitalLowercarbonCapital2023] climate startup funding. In August 2021, Chris Sacca launched four climate‐tech funds under Lowercarbon Capital with $800 million in committed capital to back early‐stage decarbonization startups, arguing that timely venture risk capital is critical for scaling innovative carbon‐removal solutions . By 2023, Lowercarbon Capital had expanded its fund to €1.5 billion, aiming for roughly 30 new climate‐tech investments per year—from Pre‐Seed to Series B+—and focusing on both engineered (e.g., direct‐air capture) and nature‐based (e.g., regenerative agriculture) removal approaches that marry rigorous science with scalable business models .
