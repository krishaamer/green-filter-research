-   What is Personalized AI?

While the financial AI companion apps in the US market are ahead globally, they are not yet using many of the user experience innovations that are prevalent on social media platforms targeted at Gen-Z and/or Millennials, possibly presenting an opportunity for cross-industry knowledge transfer, from businesses that are traditionally closer to the consumer - such as retailers. Financial AI companion apps have not yet grown to mainstream scale in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Europe, being for the moment a largely US-based retail investor trend. The apps outside of the US are niche products in a nascent stage, however, they still provide relevant design directions or stories of what to avoid. The user interface and user experience (UI/UX) of consumer-focused investing apps in Europe has improved a over the past decade. The changing landscape is related to the earlier availability of better quality apps available in the US and the disappearance of the 1st generation of rudimentary investing apps and the lessons learned on how to automate the delivery of financial services while increasing user satisfaction.

How can finance drive sustainability? 

Most sustainability plans rely on carbon credits to achieve their goals, making carbon credits a single point of failure. If the credits are not accurate, the whole system collapses.

Key focus: building real-time trust in corporate sustainability.




How can finance enable/help/encourage sustainability? Personalized Investing


An open question is whether young investors are more easily than professionals swayed by influencers? Can the democratization of various uses of money include sustainability as a feature?

For consumer activism to become mainstream it needs to much simpler. Consumers do have increasing power to use their money to reinforces certain types of businesses; as conscious consumers we can vote with our dollars. How can we do it？ Sustainable brands, ESG, etc, etc. Pushing highers Standards and choose companies that adopt circular design" What is the consumer CO~2~ contribution? What is the target? Consume pressure to advance ESG regulatory standards to add a baseline ESG dynamic pricing of risk like climate, mandatory climate disclosures, carbon pricing knowing your supply chain, analyze supply chain risk.

Trend of sustainably, how can sustainability become more accessible? People want to shop, save, and invest sustainably - how to do it?

Sustainable capital allocation methods are many. The extent to which this funnel works - and it's indeed a complex, multi–step funnel - depends on curbing greenwashing to a level that allows consumers to distinguish eco–friendly businesses from the heavy polluters.

ESG reports are very general and opaque. We need product-level analytics and reporting to be able to compare products.. ESG is filled with greenwashing. ESG is a really low bad. metrics and goals: ESG, SDGs, ESG risk. Q: Reflection on the ESG wave: Does a company that performs well in carbon reduction but whose products are harmful to health conform to the spirit of ESG? Sest ei saa ESG ja teisi mõõdikuid usaldada, crowdsourced mõõdikud.

My thesis centers on embedding transparency into every stage of a product’s life–cycle, from raw material sourcing through purchase to end‐of‐life recycling, so that young adults can make truly informed, sustainability-driven financial decisions.

Investing is a fundamentally hopeful act. It means I think there's a future. Specifically, 'green investing' is investing in the future of our planet - but can we trust the sustainability practices the 'green' investment vehicles aggregate, promising to have a positive impact? For example, the European Union for many years counted biomass as 'green' energy, even while forestry companies were cutting down trees to produce the biomass - the regulation was not specific enough to curb this practice. So, in effect, a 'green investor' might be supporting deforestation. How can an easy-to-use investment app address such complexities without alienating the users?

Copy-investing is a popular feature of retail investing platforms like EToro

For young people, investing mostly means buying cryptocurrencies?

It can be as mundane as choosing the next eco-friendly product instead of the polluting one we purchase in the supermarket make a difference? How to invest in the growth of companies that put ESG at the center of their activities instead of using it for greenwashing? Creating direct ties will improve ESG. A journey from consumption to investing, in line with users' personal values, by providing relevant sustainable finance guidance.

Consumption is ruining the world the world thinking as an investor the investor mindset. But there's so much capital in large funds retails investor money doesn't matter at all. does retail money make any difference?

Research Reason: While many people are working on AI models, there's a lack of people working on "Human-AI interaction". Sustainability is the context. How can we better team up to solve the challenges we face this century? The huge externalities.

### 'Investment-as-Product'

Green Filter helps you discover how to save money and the planet with your daily shopping. By providing an easy way for people to learn about and shop with sustainable companies, we imagine a world where people invest in their future, find great deals on responsibly-made products, and get useful discounts from socially responsible brands.

GreenFilter is a product that combines AI, design and marketing to help people manage their social impact throughout the stages of their lives, from young adult years to retirement. Its primary goal is to give people the tools they need to invest responsibly in sustainable companies, while also educating them on this topic. Our project offers a responsive website and mobile app that leverages AI and other advanced technologies. In addition, our prototype includes a reality-based virtual assistant with voice command capabilities which can provide customers with new insights into the world of green finance

GreenFilter introduces a novel, interactive point-of-sale technology that helps people make greener shopping decisions. The platform uses artificial intelligence to suggest green alternatives for products on your shopping list, and will also help you to find other companies that can make sustainable versions of the product you are buying.

As people become aware of the impact their shopping is having on the environment, they become interested in finding alternatives to big brands and large companies. GreenFilter provides designers an AI companion design which helps people build relationships with sustainability-focused companies by providing personalized recommendations, giving product reviews and helping them shop sustainably. This new tool will empower consumers to make greener choices throughout their lives.

We want to create competition around sustainable practices enter widespread adoption

Cigarettes and pictures of lung cancer every product should be required to have photos of production conditions switch such as Rainforest and deforestation the products that include Palm oil.

My thesis is that a lot of people want to do good, shop eco-friendly, invest green, etc. But they don't believe the solutions work. They don't have trust. This is a user interface issue. How to build trust.

Sustainability is hard. Green Filter helps you find companies that are making a true effort and build closer relationships through shopping, savings, and investing. Green Filter helps you find companies that are making a true effort to become sustainable and build closer relationships through shopping, savings, and investing

Gather requirements and build a prototype for the next-generation investment app for young adults. Improving the user experience for young adults getting started with (green) investing. What would a "Tinder for (Green) Investments" look like? How can we make the logistics of investing so easy to use and take into account my values?

My thesis core message is : everyone should change from consumer to sustainability investor (define these terms in the thesis). how to do this? can help you become from consumer to investor i believe there's space for a product like that. your green investing friend find the companies tackling certain problems and invest in them using crypto business can be a force for good

Consumer purchases are an indicator of demand. If demand trends down, companies will stop producing this product.
