Pete (2023) ChatGPT hackathon.

The quality of LLM output depends on the quality of the provided prompt. Zhou et al. (2022) reports creating an “Automatic Prompt Engineer” which automatically generates instructions that outperform the baseline output quality. This finding has significance for “green filter” as it validates the idea of creating advanced prompts for improved responses. For “green filter”, the input would consist of detailed user data + sustainability data for detailed analysis.
