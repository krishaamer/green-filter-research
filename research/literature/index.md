## Sources and Literature Map {#sources-and-literature-map}

Given the goal of designing an app to integrate shopping, saving, and
investing sustainably, the literature is quite broad. The literature
review maps out relationships between sustainability and AI interaction
design. The reviewed content consists of 3 main sources:

-   Scientific papers (largely from ScienceDirect) related to:

-   Sustainability, ecology, ecosystem services

-   Sustaimable investing, savings, circular economy

-   UX/UI, service design, sustainable design, speculative design,
    interaction design

-   Generation-Z demographics, behavior change, nudge

-   Review of Mobile apps (Apple iOS / Google Android) and web app
    related to:

-   Sustainable shopping apps, savings, and investing

-   Apps using algorithmic interfaces (AI-based UI)

-   EU legislation

In order to keep track more easily, each literature review section
includes **design implications** in context.
