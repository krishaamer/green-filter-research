## Eco-Design: The Legislative Perspective

In Europe, *eco-design* has strong political support as part of the
European Union’s (EU) *“Green Deal”* legislative strategy, aiming to
transform European economies into sustainability leaders. A large part
of the proposal by (Commission et al., 2014) is *eco-design*, as a large
part of product lifecycle environmental impact is defined in the design
process. The Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR)
entered into force in the EU on July 18, 2024 (European Commission,
2024) following the (European Parliament, 2022) proposal whereby the
European Commission established a general framework for *eco-design:
“requirements for sustainable products, repealing rules \[referring to
the previous Eco-Design Directive (2009/125/EC)\] currently in force
which concentrate on energy-related products only,”* setting up a level
playing-field for the organizations operating on the EU single market.
Virginijus Sinkevičius, the EU Commissioner for the Environment, Oceans
and Fisheries, is quoted describing eco-design as design that *“respects
the boundaries of our planet”* (European Commission, 2022c).

It’s not that the EU didn’t have an environmental policy before, it’s
that it was too vague and filled with loop-holes. CSRD (Corporate
Sustainability Reporting Directive) replaces NFRD (Non-Financial
Reporting Directive). ESRS reporting is a standard to meet CSRD
requirements.

The EU is also concerned with supply-chain deforestation. Sustainable
Products and EUDR (European Union Deforestation Regulation) work
hand-in-hand as part of EU’s legislative efforts to promote
sustainability. EUDR applies to all products placed on the market from
30 December 2024 and 30 June 2025 for small businesses.

The EU “Green Deal” legislative strategy is comprehensive. Eco-Design is
a Key EU Sustainable Policy Design Tool.

Europe is transforming into a hotbed of sustainability. One of the EU
goals is reducing careless consumption. Tacking our consumption habits
can help support eco-designed products. It’s up to legislators to
provide sustainable products on our marketplace… but until this happens,
we can use the green filter.

The 9 qualities of *eco-designed products* include

![](design_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-4-output-1.png)

Europe is not the only region undertaking legislative efforts to promote
sustainability. In the US, the *Inflation Reduction Act* provides
funding to development of decarbonizing technologies and includes plans
to combat air pollution, reduce green house gases and address
environmental injustices (Rajagopalan & Landrigan, 2023). Many other
jurisdictions also have laws that aim to reduce the environmental impact
of products throughout their life cycles. For instance Australia has a
Product Stewardship (PS) scheme, which also includes an investment fund
targeted at increasing the recycling rates of specific products
(Australian Government, 2024). Australia, Japan, and Taiwan all have
Sustainable Procurement schemes prioritizing greener products in public
purchases \[ADD CITATION\]. While Taiwan doesn’t yet have a specific
eco-design law, there are various pieces of legislation promoting
circular economy \[ADD CITATION\]. Already in 1988 Taiwan implemented an
Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme, followed by a recycling
system (initially focused on electronic items) in 1998 (Chong et al.,
2009). Eco-design initiatives in Taiwan started at least as early as
1994, when Taiwanese companies and universities noticed international
sustainability trends and began to implement their own sustainable
design initiatives (Jahau Lewis Chen et al., 2005).

The key to comparing Product Stewardship, Extended Producer
Responsibility (EPR), and Eco-Design is the scope, as illustrated in the
chart above. While Product Stewardship (PS) and Extended Producer
Responsibility (EPR) deal mostly with the end of the product lifecycle
(they are *reactive*), including their disposal and recycling (EPR going
a step further than PS by shifting the responsibility to the producer),
Eco-Design moves sustainability up the design chain (being
*pro-active*), setting standards for making better products - in
essence, attempting to *design-out* the waste.

![](design_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-5-output-1.png)

## Design is Political Action

Design *is* political.

I was torn whether to place *politics* under *sustainability* or
*design*, and decided for the latter - as sustainability is mostly
*descriptive*, using science to measure and present the real situation,
while design is *prescriptive*: codifying decisions about how do we
live - in products and services.

Politics matters in sustainability. In Brazil, deforestation fell 60% in
1 year, based on remote satellite reconnaissance, after the election of
a more pro-environment leadership (Watts, 2023).

-   Pater (2021)
-   10 countries use almost 100% renewable energy

There’s ample evidence from several countries suggesting moving to
renewal energy brings environmental benefits:

***Mitigating*** **Climate Change**

The monumental task of removing several gigatons of CO<sub>2</sub> from
the atmosphere requires massive policy shifts and collaboration across
countries and industries (Mackler, Fishman & Broberg, 2021).

Warming global climate has concrete effects on daily life. Warmer
climate helps viruses and fungi spread (Press, 2023). (Williams & Joshi,
2013) higher CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the air can cause more
turbulence for flights.

***Adapting*** **to Climate Change**

Many companies are developing technologies for mitigation.

In the European Union (EU), a wide range of legislative proposals,
targets, organizations, and goals already exists across diverse
countries. Upcoming laws aim to harmonize approaches to sustainability
and raise standards for all members states, in turn influencing
producers who wish to sell in the EU common market.

-   (Anon, n.d.j) report: The EU has a *taxonomy of environmentally
    sustainable economic activities* published by the Technical Expert
    Group (TEG) on sustainable finance.
-   National governments need to adapt EU legislation to local contexts.

in some areas, such as Canary Islands, where electricity production is
polluting.

We have an opportunity to re-imagine how every product can be an

Timeline of the Policy Context:

-   In 2019 by the von der Leyen commission adopted the European Union
    (EU) Green Deal strategy.

-   In 2021 the Commision proposed a goal of reducing CO2e emissions by
    55% by 2030 under the *Fit for 55* policy package consisting of a
    wide range of economic measures.

-   In November 2022, the proposal was adopted by the EU Council and EU
    Parliament with an updated goal of 57% of CO2e reductions compared
    to 1990. This proposal is set to become a binding law for all EU
    member countries (European Commission (2019b); European Commission
    (2019a); Anon (2022b); European Council (2022)).

-   In March 2022, the EU Circular Economy Action Plan was adopted,
    looking to make sustainable products *the norm* in EU and
    *empowering consumers* as described in European Commission (2022a).
    Each product covered by the policy is required to have a ***Digital
    Product Passport*** which enables improved processing within the
    supply chain and includes detailed information to empower consumers
    to understand the environmental footprint of their purchases. It’s
    safe to say the large majority of products available today do not
    meet these criteria.

## Design with Open Data

Open data is needed for civic engagement. Sharing vs Privacy is a
political question. Privacy and data-sharing are not in opposition.
Sustainability needs to be balanced with privacy. (Sanchez et al., 2022)
suggests tracking users using their smartphones and attributing points
for actions deemed beneficial yet this has potentially privacy issues.

Open Data Enables Collaboration. Taiwan is a proponent of Open Gov
OP-MSF OGP (Open Government Partnership, 2021; Lab, 2021).

Enhance interoperability (**WhatOpenData?**)

Open Knowledge International’s Global Open Data Index (GODI) ranked
Taiwan as number 1 in its global index in 2017; the project has since
been discontinued, so the ranking may be out of date in 2024
(**openknowledgefoundationGlobalOpenData2017?**).

Other indexes do not include Taiwan in the TOP 10.

![](design_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-7-output-1.png)

Data-driven design requires access to data. making the movement towards
*open data sharing* very important. Some countries and cities are better
than others at sharing data openly.

## Design for Sustainability: Diversity of Approaches

*Designing for Sustainability* *(DfS)* has been called with many names,
with subtle differences of emphasis and nuance. While the ESPR
legislation chose *Eco-Design* as the overarching title, researchers and
practitioners discuss and use *Circular Design*, *Cradle-to-Cradle
Design*, *Green Design*, *Regenerative Design*, *Climate-Responsive
Design*, *Life-Centered Design*, and many others.

In most cases, designing for sustainability makes use of *systems
thinking*, underlining the importance of looking at the entire lifecycle
of a product or service. Sustainable design encompasses all human
activities, making this pursuit an over-arching challenge across all
industries and all human activities with the complex interdependencies
contained within. (Ceschin & Gaziulusoy, 2016) gives a comprehensive
overview of the main themes of sustainable design and the main
contributions and limitations in the well–researched *“Evolution of
design for sustainability: From product design to design for system
innovations and transitions”*.

R. Buckminster Fuller “Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth”, Victor
Papanek “Design for the Real World”, Jonathan Chapman “Emotionally
Durable Design”, Carlo Vezzoli “Product-Service System Design for
Sustainability”, Ezio Manzini “Design, When Everybody Designs”.

(**engkvistWhyArenThere2024?**) calls for *Design Sociology*, design
should take account the product’s effect on society, giving the example
of highly individualized understanding of individualized psychology and
dopamine cycles for creating social media, while disregarding the
societal effects, such as spread of misinformation. Lack of
sustainability in the design process is a *bug* in the design approach.

*Service Design*, Ceschin & Gaziulusoy (2016) shows how design for
sustainability has expanded from a product focus to systems-thinking
focus placing the product inside a societal context of use. For example
Anon (n.d.d), recycled clothing maker FREITAG offers
sustainability-focused services such as cargo bikes so you can transport
your purchases and a network for *shopping without payment* = swapping
your items with other members, as well as repairs of their products.
Loaning terminology from *service design*, the user journey within an
app needs to consider each touchpoint on the way to a state of success.

![](design_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-9-output-1.png)

As this research is *practice-oriented* (i.e., my goal here is to find
design approaches that could influence my prototype), I will focus on
some fields of design which I hope relevant, fruitful, or contextual to
my project.

I will start with *Human-Centered Design*, the grandfather of design
with attitude. There’s even an ISO standard for human-centered design,
with the designated code ISO9241-210, revised as ISO 9241-210:2019
titled *“Ergonomics of human-system interaction”* and up for revision
soon (ISO standards are reviewed every 5 years). Some of the key
takeaways include “Understanding and specifying the context of use”,
“Involving users throughout design and development”, “Specifying user
requirements”, “Evaluating designs”, “Multi-disciplinary Collaboration”,
“Iterative process” and “Continual Improvement”, and finally - usability
is not enough, the design should provide a user experience (UX) for
human “emotional responses and satisfaction” (ISO, 2019).

While *Human-Centered Design* focuses exactly on what it says - humans -
*Life-Centered Design* recognizes human impact on our surrounding
environment as well - making sure we include non-human animals among our
stakeholders. This is where we are getting on the *territory* of
sustainability. While *Human-Centered Design* is ever popular, the
effect humans are having on biodiversity is rarely considered when
designing. *“\[T\]he design phase of a physical product accounts for 80%
of its environmental impact”* notes(Borthwick, Tomitsch & Gaughwin,
2022) in their framework for life-centered design.

If we’re including *other* lifeforms among our stakeholders, what can we
learn from them? *Biomimicry* is about being inspired by nature while
*Biodesign* focuses on design involving biology in the design itself.
Janine Benyus, who coined the word *Biomimicry* (Benyus, 2009) looks at
very practical cases of innovation where engineers and biologist meet
and (Dicks, 2023) provides a much more philosophical account of
following the example of nature. Focusing on the financial sector,
(Thomas & Mantri, 2022)’s philosophical account advocates for an
“inside-out” design pattern, much like natural systems, starting from
the smallest structures to guarantee resilience and survival, instead of
trying to control their external environment.

In a similar vein, *Material Ecology* is the wording preferred by the
architect Neri Oxman based at the MIT Media Lab working with
biomaterials as a proponent of *Nature-Centric Design* that adheres to
the principles of ecological sustainability with both an ecologically
conscious mindset and practical toolset (Hencz, 2022). Language and our
mental concepts shape our reality, which makes language-creation an
important tool for sustainability. Neri Oxman’s expressions in her
(World Economic Forum, 2016) interview introduce some new vocabulary:
*“ecology-indifferent”*, *“naturing”*, *“mother naturing”*, *“design is
a practice of letting go of all that is unnecessary”*, *“nature should
be our single client”*, which reminds me how self-invented language
gives un child-like freedom to imagine new worlds.

*Speculative Design* can help us imagine *non-anthropocentric* (Hupkes &
Hedman, 2022; Edwards & Pettersen, 2023)as well as *dystopian* futures
(Pinto et al., 2021). First introduced by (Dunne & Raby, 2013) in their
seminal book, the field aims to question the intersection of *user
experience design* and *speculative fiction*. (Barendregt & Vaage, 2021)
explores the potential of speculative design to stimulate public
engagement; thought experiments can spur public debate on an issue
chosen by the designer. Phil Balagtas, founder of The Design Futures
Initiative at McKinsey, discusses the value of building future scenarios
at his talk at Google. His favorite example, the Apple Knowledge
Navigator, first appeared in an Apple vision video in 1987 and took two
decades to materialize in the real world. It was inspired by a similar
device first shown in a 1970s episode of Star Trek as a *magic device*
(a term from participatory design), which then inspired subsequent
consumer product development. It took another two decades, until the
launch of the iPhone in 2007 - a total of 40 years.

*Participatory Design* and *Speculative Design* can be complementary as
in the work of (Neuhoff, Simeone & Laursen, 2023), used together to
focus on engaging users deep in the design process to truly understand
their needs, contexts and interactions on a non-superficial level. For
both speculative and participatory design, the cost and makes it into a
niche activity. Generative AI holds the promise to allow designers to
dream up and prototype quicker. In order to build a future, it’s
relevant to imagine and critique a future. By being quickly generate
prototypes, once can test out ideas with the future users involving more
of the community and stakeholders. To be able to build something, one
first needs to imagine it; imagination is crucial for change.

*Speculative Design* helps us envision future scenarios

Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is a source of many
fantastic innovations, and another.

*Regenerative Design* suggests *de*materializing (digitizing) economies
is not enough to be sustainable (by reduction of physical impact).
Design should look beyond reducing harm and find avenues to *regenerate*
damaged or even completely destroyed natural systems – ecosystems,
biodiversity, land, forests, lakes, rivers - natural habitats.

Sufficiency

Moving from products and (digital) experiences towards the built
environment and architecture, *Climate-Responsive Design* embeds a
building within the environmental constraints of a place and looks for
opportunities use the land, wind, sun, local materials, and local
vernacular history and culture when considering a design. Architect
Susanne Brorson suggests sustainability should be considered in the
earlier phases of design instead of trying to fix problems later
discussing *climate-responsive design principles* (EVM maaarhitektuuri
keskus, 2019). The sentiment is echoed by (Lee & Doevendans, 2011) who
edited a volume on sustainable approaches of world-renowned architects:
*“The principles of sustainable design are rooted in the building’s
relationship to the site and its environmental conditions such as
topography, vegetation, and climate.”*

Architecture of the Well-Tempered Environment (Banham, 1999)

*Designing for Trust*, Weinschenk (2011) says *“People expect most
online interactions to follow the same social rules as person-to-person
interactions. It’s a shortcut that your brain uses to quickly evaluate
trustworthiness.”*

*Cradle-to-Cradle Design*, focusing on recyclability of products. Anon
(2021f) and 活動通 (n.d.) Cradle to Cradle Nordic circular design in
Taiwan

*Durability* is an important dimension for sustainability. High quality
durable products are more sustainable as they last longer and less
likely to be thrown away. Forming an emotional bond with the product
makes it feel more valuable (Zonneveld & Biggemann, 2014). (Chapman,
2009) argues in his seminal paper (and later in his book) for
*“Emotionally Durable Design”*, the simple idea that we hold to things
we value and thus they are sustainable. We don’t throw away a necklace
gifted to us by mom, indeed this object might be passed down for
centuries. (Rose, 2015) has a similar idea, where *“Enchanted Objects”*
become so interlinked with us, we’re unlikely to throw them away. This
has implications for sustainability as the object is less likely to be
thrown away.

As the above shows, there are many partially overlapping design words
created by different people for diverse purposes. Design vocabulary may
be created for distinguishing a particular type of design from another -
or to market oneself as the creator of the word. There are designers who
define / brand themselves by their design method. Design Studies, a
field that studies *design* as a subject.

Here I will use the lens of *sustainability* - another complex term - to
look at how design can contribute to eco-friendly products. I advocate
looking at design methods as a toolbox, where I can pick the tool
suitable for the problem set in front of me. Here I look at a small
number of design practices I find relevant to designing a sustainability
app for college students.

than traditional design methods. While AI allows us to look at a larger
number of design scenarios thank previously feasible, there are many
approaches looking for ways to design for sustainability. Designing for
Sustainability is fundamentally a hopeful act imbibed with the dream a
healthier world is possible.

### Future Scenarios: Avoiding the Worst Cases

In sustainability there are rarely good choices. Rather it’s a question
of avoiding the worst choices.

*Scenario-building* is a key tool for sustainability. Because
sustainability is so complex, sustainable design makes use of scenarios.

*Life Cycle Assessment* and *Environmental Impact Analysis* are needed
to provide eco-design scenarios (de Otazu et al., 2022).

user experience, iteration (Google Design, 2019)

### In Practice Sustainability Begins in Software

Designing user interfaces for sustainable interactions means
incorporating data and toolsets to enable designers to make decisions
which reduce emissions of their design. Companies like AutoDesk are
putting CO<sub>2</sub> calculations inside their design software,
helping designers reduce material usage, energy consumption,
CO<sub>2e</sub> emissions, while increasing recyclability(Mike Haley,
2022). Software is key to building more sustainable products, already
for decades (Gupta et al., 2023). AI-assisted design enables design for
sustainability because the design process is where sustainability
begins. AI has the potential to provide the parameters for
sustainability. (Singh & Sarkar, 2023) proposes an AI tool for deciding
the suitable life cycle design parameters.

Design encompasses most everything in our daily lives. Humans live in
artificial environments where *most* *things* are designed by humans.
The *experiences* we take part in are increasingly created based on some
type of data.

-   Involving young HCI designers in AI-oriented workshops can show the
    future of UI/UX ? (Battistoni et al., 2023)

Data is the *interface* between idle resources and retail demand, which
makes *exchange of value* possible.

-   Different Gets Ignored Luke Wroblewski (2024)

*Digital Sustainability*, information pertaining to emissions would flow
through the economy not unlike the carbon cycle itself.

(Pan & Nishant, 2023) proposes 6 dimensions of *AI* usage in *Digital
Sustainability.*

Notice: The chart is purely illustrative to highlight the value of AI
for sustainablity; it’s not based on numeric metrics.

## Data-Driven Design: Learning from the Growth of Digital Platforms and Superapps

Digital platforms are focused on *Growth Design*, how to *attract* and
*retain* users. Superapps are the latter stage of the Digital Platform
Economy, where previously vertically targeted apps expand horizontally
to provide an ever-increasing number of services.

For digital products (apps) the main application of interaction design
is for *growth* in usage, how to get more people (user journey and
conversion funnels) to use the product i.e user acquisition, retention,
engagement, and monetization and keep using it (retention and
engagement), often optimizing onboarding, features, and personalization
(Steger, 2019; Kende, 2023).

-   Hypothesis and validation for iterating on features.

-   Total addressable market (TAM), serviceable addressable market
    (SAM), target audience (TA)

Platform economy companies popularized and expanded Data-Driven Design
in the service of growth marketing (also known colloquially as growth
hacking). Capturing User Data was part of this strategy which enabled
improving the products. Digital Product Design is increasingly
data-driven. Digital platforms operate a *design as a process* in a
continuous feedback loop, where *measurements*, *experiments,*
predictive analytics and personalization form a data-drive design
culture. As we humans go about our daily business, governments and
companies track our activities using various technologies, which
produces massive amounts of user interaction data.

Platform economy companies are the capture and use large amounts of data
from users. Data is useful for designing better products. Designing for
high retention (users keep coming back). Network Effects, the more
people use a platform, the more valuable it becomes. Platforms that
continuously add features (provided consumer legislation allows it) may
eventually evolve into superapps, which are useful for providing
services for a wide category of human needs. Bundling many services
under one super-brand. Superapps are possible thanks to Nudge, Economies
of Scale, Network Effects, Behaviour Design. Large Digital Platforms
have a very small number of workers relative to the number of users they
serve. This creates the necessity for using automation for both
understanding user needs and providing the service itself. Creating a
good product that’s useful for the large majority of users depends on
*Data-Driven Design.*

Design is as much about how it works as it’s about the interface.

Digital product design can be seen as a specific discipline under the
umbrella of Experience Design. In Michael Abrash (2017) Meta Oculus
augmented reality incubation general manager Laura Fryer: *“People buy
experiences, not technology.”*

Young people expect a product. Intelligent Interfaces use interaction
design to provide relevant and personalized information in the right
context and at the right time.

There are many approaches to design - from playful to practical to
critical and to data-driven. Nonetheless, many types of design share a
common goal designing for a good *user experience*. Simplifying.

*Personalization*: the largest businesses today (measured in number of
users) design the whole user experience.

*Scale,* Popular consumer platforms strive to design solutions that feel
personalized at every touchpoint on the user journey (to use the
language of service design) at the scale of hundreds of billions of
users.

Superapps are honeypots of data that is used for many types of behavior
modeling. (Suarez et al., 2021) suggests using alternative data from
super-apps to estimate user income levels, including 4 types of data:
Personal Information, Consumption Patterns, Payment Information, and
Financial services. (Roa et al., 2021) finds super-app alternative data
is especially useful for credit-scoring young, low-wealth individuals.
The massive amounts of data generated by these companies are used by
smart cities to re-design their physical environments.

-   Inspiration from WeChat. Twitter (now X) is becoming a financial
    app. X (formerly Twitter) is becoming a superapp?

-   Uber is creating an all-purpose platform; only 4.1% of rides were
    electric (Levy, 2023).

How can the mobile devices which the majority of us are carrying with us
every day, help us make decisions about the businesses we engage with?
In terms of user experience, can personalized AI advisors empower our
financial actions from shopping to saving and investing?

    prevalent in China and South-East Asia. (Giudice, 2020) finds WeChat
    has had a profound impact on changing China into a cashless society,
    underlining how one mobile app can transform social and financial
    interactions of an entire country. China is the home of many
    superapps and (Vecchi & Brennan, 2022) discusses the strategies
    Chinese apps are taking to expand to other markets. (Shabrina
    Nurqamarani et al., 2020) discusses the system consistency and
    quality of South-East Asian superapps Gojek and Grab.

-   Platform economy companies have been criticized for their lack of
    workers rights (ESG). (Anon, 2024b) uses portable air pollution
    tracking devices to documents how gig workers are subjected to
    pollution.

Could there be Sustainability Superapps?

-   How to design sustainability superapps? Lots of options in a single
    app. (Fleet Management Weekly, 2022) “Sustainability and superapps

    rise of carbon-centric super apps”. (goodbag, 2023) “goodbag:

### Behavioral Design

For several decades, marketing researchers have been looking into how to
affect human behavior towards increasing purchase decisions in commerce,
both offline and online, which is why the literature on behavioral
design is massive. One of the key concepts is *nudge*, first coined in
2008 by the Nobel-winning economist Richard Thaler; nudges are based on
a scientific understanding of human psychology and shortcuts and
triggers that human brains use and leverages that knowledge to influence
humans in small but powerful ways (Thaler & Sunstein, 2009).

The principles of nudge have also been applied to sustainability. For
example, a small study (n=33) in the Future Consumer Lab in Copenhagen
by (Perez-Cueto, 2021) found that designing a “dish-of-the-day” which
was prominently displayed helped to increase vegetarian food choice by
85%. Experiments by (Guath, Stikvoort & Juslin, 2022) focused on
environmentally friendly online purchases in Sweden (n=200) suggest
nudging can be effective in influencing online shopping behavior towards
more sustainable options. A study of behavior change in Australia at
large university setting (N = 156) by (Novoradovskaya et al., 2021)
found nudging behavioral change had a significant effect and the author
suggested it may help to avoid some of the *“16 billion paper coffee
cups are being thrown away every year”* globally (based on the
abstract - I was unable to access the full paper).

Google uses nudges in Google Flights and Google Maps, which allow
filtering flights and driving routes by the amount of CO<sub>2</sub>
emissions, as well as surfacing hotels with Green Key and EarthCheck
credentials, while promising new sustainability features across its
portfolio of products (Sundar Pichai, 2021). Such tools are small user
interface nudges which Google’s research calls *digital
decarbonization*, defined by (Implement Consulting Group, 2022) as
*“Maximising the enabling role of digital technologies by accelerating
already available digital solutions”*.

In (Kate Brandt & Matt Brittin, 2022), Google’s Chief Sustainability
Officer Kate Brandt set a target of “at least 20-25%” CO<sub>2</sub>
emission reductions in Europe to reach a net-zero economy and the global
announcement set a target of helping 1 billion people make more
sustainable choices around the world (Jeni Miles, 2022). In addition to
end–users, Google offers digital decarbonization software for
developers, including the Google Cloud Carbon Footprint tool and invests
in regenerative agriculture projects (Anon, 2021b; Google, 2023).

## Personalizing: Sustainability at Scale

-   Personalization, Personal User Experience. social apps require
    personalization, *trust* and *k-factors* (sharing and inviting your
    friends). (Baron, 2023; Kim, 2023).

Data-Driven Design Enables Sustainability. Sustainability touches every
facet of human existence and is thus an enormous undertaking. Making
progress on sustainability is only possible if there’s a large-scale
coordinated effort by humans around the planet. For this to happen,
appropriate technological tools are required.

Data-driven design has limitations.

## Personalized Design: Self-Monitoring

Research on *personal data tracking* also known as *quantified self* or
*self-monitoring* is abundant. Wearable devices including the Apple
Watch, Oura Ring, Fitbit and others, combined with apps, help users
track a variety of health metrics. Apart from health, wearable devices
have been used to track other metrics such as physiological parameters
of students at school to determine their learning efficiency (Giannakos
et al., 2020). Not only can health metrics be tracking, but exposure to
pollution as well as personal carbon footprint, are all to some extent
track-able (if not traceable).

Personal data enables behavior change.

### Health and Fitness Tracking

Tracking one’s health and fitness is a familiar mode of *quantified
self*, available to many smartwatch users - and even pretty much to
anyone who has a phone made in the past decade. Apple is a leader in
health tracking, releasing Apple Health in 2008 as an iOS 8 software
feature and the Apple Watch in 2015, filled with health-focused sensors
and features (**appleHowAppleEmpowering2022?**). In 2022 Apple outlined
plans for *“empowering people to live a healthier day,”* promising a new
set of health-features with every release, such as the rumored
temperature measurement inside of Apple Aipord earphones; and providing
most of this data to developers through Apple’s HealthKit health metrics
APIs, which app builders can tap into (Apple, 2022a, 2022b).

Sleep quality is an important aspect of health and many devices and apps
focus on helping people get enough high quality sleep. There’s plenty of
academic literature on how physical activity, as well as environmental
aspects, such as air quality, affect sleep (Liu et al., 2019) tracks how
wearable data is used for tracking sleep improvements from exercise.
(Grigsby-Toussaint et al., 2017) made use of sleep apps to construct
humans behaviors also known as *behavioral constructs*.

The Oura ring is an example of *calm technology*, providing helpful data
without calling an attention to itself (Phelan, 2024).

EEG (electroencephalogram), ECG (Electrocardiogram), EDA (Electrodermal
Activity): tracking features of brain, heart and nervous system
activity. Brain Music Lab founder and brain researcher Grace Leslie:
*“brain music sounds like a warm bathtub”*. Tracking blood sugar with
app and patches. Blood sugar trackers. Blood glucose tracking is popular
even for people without diabetes, to optimize their activity (Anon,
2021d). Tracking urine consistency inside your toilet with WithThings.
Companies like NeuralLink are building devices to build meaningful
interactions from brain waves (EEG).

Use technology Wearables to be more aware of one’s health. Example of
quantified self device.

There’s value in developing standardized fitness metrics, which
different digital health providers can use to create dashboards with
comparable data. Even with messy data, AI has a useful role as a
translator between different standards.

Could one track personal sustainability in a similar fashion? (Shin et
al., 2019)’s synthesis review of 463 studies shows wearable devices have
potential to influence behavior change towards healthier lifestyles.
Saubade et al. (2016) finds health tracking is useful for motivating
physical activity. The urban environment has an influence on health.

While so of the behavior changes may sound simple - like switching from
driving to walking - and would have a large environmental effect, they
are hindered by factors from personal motivation to (lack of) suitable
urban architecture. (Delclòs-Alió et al., 2022) discusses walking in
Latin-American cities. Walking is the most sustainable method or
transport but requires the availability of city infrastructure, such as
sidewalks, which many cities still lack.

While the scale of climate change is too big for individual action to
make a difference, individual action can foster hope and a sense of
collective responsibility (Nature, 2020).

-   Kristian Steensen Nielsen (2022) **Individual climate action!!!**

-   The UN has been handing out Global Climate Action Awards since 2011
    for idea such as the Climate Credit Card in Switzerland, which
    automatically tracks emissions of purchases, creates emissions’
    reports for the user which can then be offset with investments in
    climate projects around the world (UNFCCC, 2023).

-   Give Gen-Z the tools to turn climate anger into positive change to
    transform companies

-   Echeverría, Gimenez-Nadal & Molina (2022) suggests greener modes of
    mobility.

-   Green Finance Platform (2020) report predicts the rise of
    personalizing sustainable finance, because of its potential to grow
    customer loyalty, through improving the user experience. Similarly
    to good design, interacting with sustainable finance for the
    ‘green-minded’ demographics, providing a reliable green product is a
    way to build customer loyalty.

Another aspect is tracking one’s mental health. (Tyler, Boldi &
Cherubini, 2022) surveys the use of self-reflection apps in the UK
(n=998).

-   Popular Strava (100+ million users) sports assistant provides run

The small screen estate space of mobiles phones and smart watches
necessitates displaying content in a dynamic manner. Virtual reality
glasses (called AR/VR or XR in marketing speak) need dynamic content
because the user is able to move around the environment. These are
questions that interaction design is called upon to solve. Hoang (2022):
*“Dynamic interfaces might invoke a new design language for extended
reality”. it’s a balancing at: while* AI enables generative UIs while
users need some type of stability (think: text input stays in the same
place but different types of interfaces appear within a clearly defined
space.

Speaking is one mode of interaction that’s become increasingly possible
as machines learn to interpret human language.

Human behavior is affected by the environment; example in case, the
incidence of bad behavior during the pandemic increased significantly.

### Towards Tracking Sustainability: Carbon Tracking

The founder of the Commons (formerly known as Joro) consumer
CO<sub>2e</sub> tracking app recounts how people have a gut feeling
about the 2000 calories one needs to eat daily, so perhaps daily
CO<sub>2e</sub> tracking could develop a gut feeling about one’s carbon
footprint (Jason Jacobs, 2019).

-   

Personal carbon footprint tracking apps (aka CO2 calculators) in a
mid-sized German city (N=216) helped overall emission reduction by 23%
correlating with feedback from the app specifically reducing emissions
from heating 26.9%, food 16.4%, household 34.7% reduction, and mobility
12%(Hoffmann et al., 2024).

We have a limited carbon budget so calculating CO2e-cost become
integrated into every activity.

-   CO2e calculations will be part of our everyday experience

-   Zhang’s Personal Carbon Economy conceptualized the idea of carbon as
    a currency used for buying and selling goods and services, as well
    as an individual carbon exchange to trade one’s carbon permits
    (Zhang, 2018).

Personal Carbon Trackers

Personal carbon footprint calculators have been released online, ranging
from those made by governments and companies to student projects.
Similar to personal health trackers, personal CO<sub>2</sub> trackers
help one track emissions and suggests sustainable actions.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[7] }} />

## Re-Designing Industries: Circularity

As of 2024, *circular economy* is a tiny part of the world economy.
(Circle Economy, 2022) reports only 8.6% of world economy is circular
and *100B tonnes of virgin materials* are sourced every year.

We’re in an industrial revolution. Many companies are investing into
transforming their processes. *“\[T\]ransition to a low carbon economy
presents challenges and potential economic benefits that are comparable
to those of previous industrial revolutions”* (Pearson & Foxon, 2012).
It’s possible to re-design entire industries and that is exactly the
expectation sustainability sets on businesses. Across all industries,
there’s a call for more transparency. Conversations about sustainability
are too general and one needs to look at the specific sustainability
metrics at specific industries to be able to design for meaningful
interaction. There’s plentiful domain-specific research showing how
varied industries can develop eco-designed products. I will here focus
on 3 industries that are relevant for college students.

Food and clothes (I’m omitting housing and transport here) are part of
the immediate environmental impact of college students.

### Circular Design for a Circular Economy

Encouraging Sustainable Design and Reducing Waste.

(Liu et al., 2023) reports, e-waste is growing 3%-5% every year,
globally. (Thukral & Singh, 2023) identifies several barriers to e-waste
management among producers including lack of awareness and
infrastructure, attitudinal barriers, existing *informal* e-waste
sector, and the need for an e-waste license.

### Case: Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG)

Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) also known as Consumer Packaged Goods
(CPG) are large global congloremates operating with low margins and high
volumes (Toh, 2024). The largest of them have several billions in
revenue (Kenton, 2024).

![](design_files/figure-markdown_strict/cell-14-output-1.png)

Rise of e-commerce has pushed logistics companies to increase delivery
efficiency to keep up with FMCG sales (Deliverect, 2024).

### Case: Fashion

Just like Fast-Moving Consumer Goods, fast fashion operates with low
margins and follows consumer trends. Young people are the largest
consumers of fast fashion (Anon, n.d.z). (In European Environment
Agency, 2022 European Environment Agency (EEA)) estimates based on trade
and production data that EU27 citizens consumed an average 15kg of
textile products per person per year. The European Commission wants to
reduce the impact of fast fashion on EU market (ERR, 2022).
(Millward-Hopkins, Purnell & Baurley, 2023) shows how 50% of the textile
waste in the UK is exported to other countries.

“26 million tons of clothing end up in China’s landfills each year,
propelled by fast fashion” (Tian Macleod Ji, 2024).

Greenwashing is prevalent in the fashion industry. **Problem**: Emily
Chan (2022a) report says there’s not enough transparency in fashion.
Fashion Revolution Foundation (2022) Fashion transparency index.
(Wikirate, 2022): “Among the Index’s main goals are to help different
stakeholders to better understand what data and information is being
disclosed by the world’s largest fashion brands and retailers, raise
public awareness, educate citizens about the social and environmental
challenges facing the global fashion industry and support people’s
activism”. Consumer understanding of sustainability is limited. Mabuza,
Sonnenberg & Marx-Pienaar (2023) shows consumer knowledge of apparel
coloration is very limited.

2.4 Trillion USD fashion industry contributing 2%-8% of total global GHG
emissions, 100B USD lost to lack of recycling, contributes 9% of
microplastics (Adamkiewicz et al., 2022). (Centobelli et al., 2022)
Fashion industry year uses 9B cubic meters of water, 1.7B tonnes of
CO<sub>2</sub>, 92 million tonnes of textile waste. Köhler et al. (2021)
Globally 87% of textile products are burned or landfilled after 1st
consumer use.

#### Towards Sustainable Clothes

-   There are local policy initiatives aiming to tackle the waste
    problem. For example the New Standard Institute’s proposed “Fashion
    Act” to require brands doing business in New York City to disclose
    sustainability data and set waste reduction targets (Emily Chan,
    2022b) .

-   (Leung & Luximon, 2021) There’s a growing know-how on how to produce
    sustainably and which materials to use. “Handbook of Footwear Design
    and Manufacture” Chapter 18 - Green design. Industry collaboration
    can raise the bar for everyone, such as the Better Cotton Initiative
    (Better Cotton, 2023).

-   Story of Patagonia (Chouinard, 2005)\].

Sustainable Fashion, Textile Design

-   There are signs of young Chinese consumers valuing experiences over
    possessions (Jiang, 2023).

Across industries, reports are saying there isn’t enough transparency.

### Case: Food

Re-designing industrial food systems for an increasing global population
is a challenge. Supply chain innovation in food industries may enable
more transparency. **provenance and traceability of food has
implications for sustainability and health.**

Global warming leading to droughts and extreme weather, wars and
conflicts increased volatility in food prices (Eshe Nelson, Ana Swanson
& Jeanna Smialek, 2023).

“The agricultural sector contributes to approximately 13.5% of the total
global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and accounts for 25% of
the total CO<sub>2</sub> emission” (Nabipour Afrouzi et al., 2023).
Poore & Nemecek (2018) suggests 26% of carbon emissions come from food
production. Saner et al. (2015) reports dairy (46%) and meat and fish
(29%) products making up the largest GHG emission potential. Springmann
et al. (2021) proposes veganism is the most effective decision to reduce
personal CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.

*Farm to Fork* is a European Union policy to shorten the supply chain
from the producer to the consumer and add transparency to the system.
Patel et al. (2023) livestock products (meat) are 15% of agricultural
foods valued at €152 billion in 2018 globally.

**Fishing**

-   75% of fishing is done using industrial Trawling, which has
    environmental impact

-   Bailey & Eggereide (2020) shows how the Norwegian government plans
    to increase salmon production 5x by 2050. How can this be
    sustainable? Mostly this means fish-farming

-   Complex supply chains make seafood (marine Bivalvia, mollusks)
    logistics prone to fraud, leading to financial losses and threats to
    consumer health (Santos et al., 2023). (Chang et al., 2021) *fish
    fraud* is a large global problem but it’s possible to use
    DNA-tracking to prove where the fish came from. In “2019, the 27
    KURA SUSHI branches in Taiwan sold more than 46 million plates of
    sushi. in Taiwan”. Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IIU)
    fishing is widespread; the EU is adopting countermeasures (Kim &
    Lim, 2024). Muñoz et al. (2023) Is there such a thing as sustainable
    fishing? Bottom trawling is the worst and should be banned. Katie
    Gustafson (2022) proposes a **“Uniform traceability system for the
    entire supply chain”** for seafood. Mamede et al. (2022) proposes
    *Seafood tracing*: Fingerprinting of Sea Urchin.

-   The same is true for cocoa beans, which are at risk from food fraud
    (Fanning et al., 2023).

-   **Perennial Crops,** Multi-year crops reduce inputs of gasoline,
    labor, etc. (Aubrey Streit Krug & Yin Lu, 2023). Large agritech
    companies like Monsanto rely on selling seeds annually for profits
    putting them at odds with **Perennial crops**. Single-year seeds
    have led to farmer suicides when crops fail in poor communities.

    to be a newcomer and innovative crop in Europe, and now it’s so
    common, Europeans forget it’s no originally from Europe. Food is
    also about cuisine and culture; foods become popular if we hear
    stories and see cuisine around a particular crop (Aubrey Streit Krug
    & Yin Lu, 2023).

### Circular Design

Circular design is only possible if supply chains become circular as
well.

It’s important in which structure data is stored, affecting the ability
to efficiently access and manage the data while guaranteeing a high
level of data integrity, security, as well as energy usage of said data.

The complexity of resource and delivery networks necessitates more
advanced tools to map supply chains (Knight et al., 2022). The COVID19
pandemic and resulting blockages in resource delivery highlighted the
need to have real-time visibility into supply chains (Finkenstadt &
Handfield, 2021).

Blockchains are a type of shared database where the data is stored in
several locations with a focus on making the data secure and very
difficult to modify after it’s been written to the database. Once data
is written to the blockchain, modifying it would require changing all
subsequent records in the chain and agreement of the majority of
validators who host a version of the database. Blockchain is the main
technology considered for accounting for the various inputs and complex
web of interactions between many participants inside the supply chain
networks. There are hundreds of paper researching blockchain use in
supply change operations since 2017 (Dutta et al., 2020). Blockchains
enable saving immutable records into distributed databases (also known
as ledgers). It’s not possible to (or extremely difficult) to change the
same record, only new records can be added on top of new ones.
Blockchains are useful for data sharing and auditing, as the time and
place of data input can be guaranteed, and it will be easier to conduct
a search on who inputted incorrect data; however the system still relies
on correct data input. As the saying goes, *“garbage in, garbage out”*.

There are several technologies for tracking goods across the supply
chain, from shipping to client delivery. Data entry is a combination of
manual data input and automated record-keeping facilitated by sensors

**Tracking Transport Supply Chains**

Products are made from resources distributed across the planet and
transported to clients around the world which currently causes high
levels (and increasing) of greenhouse gases. *“Transport greenhouse gas
emissions have increased every year since 2014”* (Anon, 2023a). Freight
(transport of goods by trucks, trains, planes, ships) accounts for 1.14
gigatons of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions as per 2015 data or 16% of total
international supply chain emissions (Wang et al., 2022).

### Extended Producer Responsibility

Extended Producer Responsibility Enables Companies to be Resposible.

Popular blogs such as (Kohli, 2019) and (Lose, 2023) offer many
suggestions how designers can help people become more sustainable in
their daily lives yet focusing on the end-user neglects the producers’
responsibility (termed as Extended Producer Responsibility or ERP) in
waste management studies.

Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is a policy tool first proposed
by Thomas Lindhqvist in Sweden in 1990 \[ADD CITATION\], aimed to
encourage producers take responsibility for the entire life-cycle of
their products, thus leading to more eco-friendly products. Nonetheless,
EPR schemes do not guarantee circularity and may instead be designed
around fees to finance waste management in linear economy models
(Christiansen, Hasse & Tønder, 2021). The French EPR scheme was upgraded
in 2020 to become more circular (Jacques Vernier, 2021). In July 2024,
Latvia was the 4th EU country to join an textile-EPR scheme (Anon,
2024a).

In any case, strong consumer legislation (such as EPR) has a direct
influence on producers’ actions. For example, in HKTDC Research (2022),
the Hong Kong Trade Development Council notified textile producers in
July 2022 reminding factories to produce to French standards in order to
be able enter the EU market. Peng, Shi & Tong (2023) finds that the
***Carbon Disclosure Project*** has been a crucial tool to empower ERP
in Chinese auto-producers.

-   The success of EPR can vary per type of product. For car tires, the
    EPR scheme in the Netherlands claims a 100% recovery rate
    Campbell-Johnston et al. (2020).

One type of legislation that works?

-   (Steenmans & Ulfbeck, 2023) Argues for the need to engage companies
    through legislation and shift from waste-centered laws to product
    design regulations.

-   In Europe, there’s large variance between member states when in
    comes to textile recycling: while Estonia and France are the only EU
    countries where separate collection of textiles is required by law,
    in Estonia 100% of the textiles were burned in an incinerator in
    2018 while in France textiles are covered by an Extended Producer
    Responsibility (EPR) scheme leading to higher recovery rates (Ibid).

Return, Repair, Reuse

-   There’s a growing number of companies providing re-use of existing
    items.

    to discover”. elegant.

    reporting becoming “water neutral” and calls on companies to release
    more detailed information.

### Digital Product Passports

Even though this topic belongs under Circular Economy, I’ve chose to
highlight *digital product passports* here as it’s the main design
implication from this chapter - an emerging technology which needs to be
designed for the user.

I will being with a bit of history to contextualize what has already
been tried. CO<sub>2e</sub> labeling initiatives are an early form of
communicating the environmental cost of each product. Using carbon
labels to communicate CO<sub>2e</sub> emission of consumer products has
been a topic of discussion for decades (Adam Corner, 2012). Academic
literature has looked at minute details such as color and positioning of
the label (Zhou et al., 2019). There’s some indication consumers are
willing to pay a small premium for low-CO<sub>2e</sub> products; all
else being equal, consumers choose the option with a lower
CO<sub>2e</sub> number (Xu & Lin, 2022; Carlsson, Kataria & Lampi,
2022). (Cohen & Vandenbergh, 2012) argues labeling the carbon footprint
of products does help inform consumer choice towards sustainability and
help promote a green economy. A large-scale study of UK university
students finds some evidence to suggest labeling low CO<sub>2e</sub>
food enables people to choose a *climatarian diet*, however the impact
of carbon labels on the market share of low-carbon meals is negligible
(Lohmann et al., 2022).

Labels alone are not enough. A study in Sweden underlines a negative
correlation between worrying about climate impact and interest in
climate information on products (Edenbrandt & Lagerkvist, 2022). This
latter finding may be interpreted to suggest a need for wider
environmental education programs among consumers. (Asioli et al., 2022)
found differences between countries, where Spanish and British consumers
chose meat products with *‘No antibiotics ever’* over a *Carbon Trust*
label, whereas French consumers chose CO<sub>2</sub> labeled meat
products.

however several studies show their effect is negligible. Nonetheless,
the idea of *Carbon Labelling* is yet to find mainstream adoption.

Carbon labeling is voluntary. Only a handful of companies practice
carbon-labeling but the number is growing. The U.S. restaurant chain
*Just Salad* , U.K.-based vegan meat-alternative *Quorn* and plant milk
*Oatly* are some example of companies that provide carbon labeling on
their products (Brian Kateman, 2020). (ClimatePartner, 2020): Companies
like ClimatePartner and Carbon Calories offers labeling consumer goods
with emission data as a service. (The Carbon Trust, n.d.): The Carbon
Trust reports it’s certified 27 thousand product footprints.

-   Digitalisation and digital transformation; Digital Receipts are one
    data source for tracking one’s carbon footprint (Anon, n.d.g).

-   Ivanova et al. (2020) “establish consumption options with a high
    mitigation potential measured in tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent
    per capita per year.”

-   55% of emissions come from energy production.

-   1.7 trillion tons of CO2e emissions since the 1760s (start of the
    industrial revolution) (Global Carbon Budget, 2023; Marvel, 2023).

Transitioning from simpler Carbon Labels to data-driven Digital Product
Passports requires comprehensive data collection, digital
infrastructure, industry collaboration, regulatory frameworks and
consumer engagement.

-   Circularise introduced an early blockchain-based sustainability
    system in 2016 aiming to improve transparency across several
    industries and is currently the market leader in providing *Digital
    Product Passports* (Stretton, 2022a) “Ecodesign for Sustainable
    Products Regulation (part of the Sustainable Products Initiative)
    and one of the key actions under the Circular Economy Action Plan
    (CEAP). The goal of this initiative is to lay the groundwork for a
    gradual introduction of a digital product passport in at least three
    key markets by 2024” “Connecting the Value Chain, One Product at a
    Time”. “Circularise aims to overcome the communication barrier that
    is limiting the transition to a circular economy with an open,
    distributed and secure communications protocol based on blockchain
    technology.”

Digital product passports are a further development of the idea of
carbon labels.

-   The European Commision has proposed a *Digital Product Passports* to
    help companies transfer environmental data (Nissinen, Seppälä &
    Heinonen, 2022). Carbon labels are needed for green transformation.

-   Reich et al. (2023) “Information gaps are identified as one of the
    major obstacles to realizing a circular economy.”

-   Jensen et al. (2023) “support decision-making throughout product
    life cycles in favor of a circular economy.”

-   King, Timms & Mountney (2023) “influence consumer behavior towards
    sustainable purchasing and responsible product ownership by making
    apparent sustainability aspects of a product life cycle.”

-   Berger et al. (2023c) “support Sustainable Product Management by
    gathering and containing product life cycle data. However, some life
    cycle data are considered sensitive by stakeholders, leading to a
    reluctance to share such data.”

Anon (2021f) 台灣設計研究院（TDRI ） on Instagram: "▌北歐循環設計論壇
開放報名中 -
近幾年，全球的極端氣候造成各地災害頻傳，人們更加意識到要珍惜地球資源，丹麥從10幾年前就開始推行低碳生活，哥本哈根海洋上成排的風力發電機供應丹麥20%以上的能源，哥本哈根的學校建造出全世界最大的太陽能板，甚至丹麥的設計團隊進行設計皆從永續環境為本心出發，在丹麥，每一個生活環節都是循環設計！ -
但丹麥談的循環永續不只是不具經濟效益的理念，循環經濟對丹麥來說不僅具有環境層面的效益，還可提升企業的競爭力，對資源生產力、就業機會、資源供應安全和自然資源的可持續利用都有極正向的回饋。 -
本次國際論壇，我們邀請來自丹麥的設計師Ditte Lysgaard
Vind從循環經濟策略、Rosa N<span class="nocase">ø</span>ss
Bendixen從產品設計、Helene
Jensen從時尚產業、更有台灣的團隊奇想創造、光寶科技、REnato
Lab從不同產業類別，以跨領域的思維，分享他們循環再造的創意點子! -
