## Platform Economy Popularises Data-Driven Design

As we humans go about our daily business, we produce massive amounts of
data, which is useful for designing better products. There are many
approaches to design and the majority share the common goal of designing
for a good user experience.

Designing for high retention (users keep coming back).

### Capturing User Data

Platform economy companies capture large amounts of data from users.

*Network Effects,* the more people use a platform, the more valuable it
becomes.

**Data is The Interface:** *platform economy* marketplace companies like
Airbnb and Uber match idle resources with retail demand and optimize how
our cities work.

By continuously adding features (and provided consumer legislation
allows it), platforms can evolve into superapps. Superapps are possible
thanks to **Nudge, Economies of Scale, Network Effects, Behaviour
Design.**

Personalization at scale: the largest businesses today (measured in
number of users) design the whole user experience. Popular consumer
platforms strive to design solutions that feel personalized at every
touchpoint on the user journey (to use the language of service design)
at the scale of hundreds of billions of users.

Superapps are honeypots of data that is used for many types of behavior
modeling. (Suarez, G. et al., 2021) suggests using alternative data from
super-apps to estimate user income levels, including 4 types of data:
Personal Information, Consumption Patterns, Payment Information, and
Financial services. (Roa et al., 2021) finds super-app alternative data
is especially useful for credit-scoring young, low-wealth individuals.
The massive amounts of data generated by these companies are used by
smart cities to re-design their physical environments.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[0] }} />

-   Superapps are prevalent in China and South-East Asia.
    (Giudice, 2020) finds WeChat has had a profound impact on changing
    China into a cashless society, underlining how one mobile app can
    transform social and financial interactions of an entire country.
    (Vecchi and Brennan, 2022) China is the home of many superapps and
    this paper discusses the strategies taken to expand to other
    markets. (Shabrina Nurqamarani et al., 2020) discusses the system
    consistency and quality of South–East Asian superapps Gojek and
    Grab.

-   Platform economy companies have been criticized for their lack of
    workers rights (ESG). (Anon., 2024a) uses portable air pollution
    tracking devices to documents how gig workers are subjected to
    pollution.

-   Uber is creating an all-purpose platform; only 4.1% of rides were
    electric (Levy, 2023).

-   Twitter (X) is becoming a superapp?

Could there be Sustainability Superapps?

-   How to design sustainability superapps? Lots of options in a single
    app. (Fleet Management Weekly, 2022) “Sustainability and superapps
    top Gartner’s Top 10 2023 Trends List”. (Dave Wallace, 2021) “The
    rise of carbon-centric super apps”. (goodbag, 2023) “goodbag:
    Sustainable Super App”. What would a sustainable investment platform
    that matches green investments with the consumers look like, if one
    saw the side-by-side comparison of investment vehicles on their ESG
    performance? Also (Bernard, 2022).

## Data Enables Generative UIs

In design there are many overlapping terms created by different people
for diverse purposes from distinguishing a particular type of design to
marketing oneself as the creator of the term.

There are many ways to structure design theory but for the purposes of
this AI-focused research, I will begin from Generative UI.

structure: data-driven design, generative UI

AI will decide what kind of UI to show to you based on the data and
context

-   Replit, a startup known for allowing user build apps in the web
    browser, released Openv0, a framework of AI-generated UI components
    (Replit, 2023). “Components are the foundation upon which user
    interfaces (UI) are built, and generative AI is unlocking component
    creation for front-end developers, transforming a once arduous
    process, and aiding them in swiftly transitioning from idea to
    working components.”
-   Vercel introduced an open-source prototype UI-generator called V0
    which used large language models (LLMs) to create code for web pages
    based on text prompts (Vercel, 2023). Other similar tools quickly
    following including Galileo AI, Uizard AutoDesigner and Visily
    (Anon., 2024b).
-   In 2014, the eminent journal *Information Sciences* decided to
    dedicate a special section to AI-generated software to call
    attention to this tectonic shift in software development (Reformat,
    2014).
-   As machines become more capable, machines will eventually be capable
    of producing machines.
-   Generative UIs are largely invented in practice, based on user data
    analysis and experimentation, rather than being built in theory.
    Kelly Dern, a Senior Product Designer at Google lead a workshop in
    early 2024 on *GenUI for product inclusion* aiming to create
    ***“**more accessible and inclusive \[UIs for\] users of all
    backgrounds**”.***
-   (Anon., 2023a) gives an overview of the history of generative AI
    design tools going back in time until 2012 when (Troiano and
    Birtolo, 2014) proposed genetic algorithms for UI design.
-   (Fletcher, J., 2023) and (Joe Blair, 2024) are worried UIs are
    becoming average; that is more and more similar towards the lowest
    common denominator. We can generate better ones that are based on
    user data and would be truly personalized.
-   (Nielsen, 2024) recounts how 30 years of work towards usability has
    largely failed - computers are still not accessible enough
    (***“difficult, slow, and unpleasant”***) - and has hope Generative
    UI could offer a chance to provide levels of accessibility humans
    could not.
-   (Matteo Sciortino, 2024) coins the phrase RTAG UIs *“real-time
    automatically-generated UI interfaces”* mainly drawing from the
    example of how his Netflix interface looks different from that of
    his sisters because of their dissimilar usage patterns.
-   (Anon., 2024c) Meanwhile is very critical because for the following
    reasons:

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[1] }} />

What is the user interface of the green transformation?

-   Kate Moran and Sarah Gibbons (2024) “highly personalized,
    tailor-made interfaces that suit the needs of each individual”
    “Outcome-Oriented Design”

McKeough (2018) business consultancies have begun to recognize the
importance of design to business. They advise their corporate clients to
bring user experience design to the core of their business operations.

There’s a number of user interface design patterns that have provide
successful across a range of social media apps. Such ***user experience
/ user interface*** (UX/UI) patterns are copied from one app to another,
to the extent that the largest apps share a similar look and feature
set. Common UX/UI parts include the Feed and Stories. By using common UI
parts from social media users have an easier time to accept the
innovative parts. add Viz charts. Avatars are increasingly common and
new generations are used to talking to computers.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[2] }} />

There are also more philosophical approaches to ***Interface Studies:***
David Hoang (2022), the head of product design at Webflow, suggests
taking cues from art studies to ***isolate the core problem***: *“An art
study is any action done with the intention of learning about the
subject you want to draw”*. As a former art student, Hoang looks at an
interface as *“a piece of design is an artwork with function”*.

Indeed, art can be a way to see new paths forward, practicing
“*fictioning*” to deal with problematic legacies: Anon. (2023b)

### **Interaction Design**

-   Involving young HCI designers in AI-oriented workshops can show the
    future of UI/UX ? (Battistoni et al., 2023)

### Speculative Design

Speculative design makes use of future scenarios to envision contexts
and interactions in future use. The term ***speculative design*** was
invented by Dunne and Raby (2013) in their seminal book to question the
intersection of user experience design and speculative fiction. For
example Barendregt and Vaage (2021) explores the potential of
speculative design to stimulate public engagement through thought
experiments that spur public debate on an issue chosen by the designer.

Phil Balagtas, founder of The Design Futures Initiative at McKinsey,
discusses the value of building future scenarios at his talk at Google.
One of his examples, the Apple Knowledge Navigator, from an Apple vision
video in 1987, took two decades to materialize in the real world. It was
inspired by a similar device first shown in a 1970s episode of Star Trek
as a **magic device** (a term from participatory design), which then
inspired subsequent consumer product development. It took another 2
decades, until the launch of the iPhone in 2007 - a total of 40 years.
Imagination is crucial for change (Google Design, 2019).

The cost of speculative design makes it into a niche activity yet
Generative AI holds the promise to allow designers to dream up and
prototype quicker. In order to build a future, it’s relevant to imagine
and critique a future.

The same is true for Participatory Design. By being quickly generate
prototypes, once can test out ideas with the future users involving more
of the community and stakeholders.

### Quantified Self

Example of quantified self device. My personal air pollution exposure
tracked using the Atmotube device attached to my backpack.

-   Open Source code for calculating air pollution exposure AQI:
    https://github.com/atmotube/aqipy

-   Quantified Self is an example of Digital Health

-   Tracking air pollution and realizing how bad the over in my

-   There is a parallel in health to sustainability and indeed both are
    inextricably linked.

-   Use technology Wearables to be more aware of one’s health.

-   EEG (brain smth), EDA (Electrodermal Activity), ECG
    (Electrocardiogram): tracking features of brain, heart and nervous
    system activity. Brain Music Lab founder and brain researcher Grace
    Leslie: “brain music sounds like a warm bathtub”.

-   Companies like NeuralLink are building devices to build meaningful
    interactions from brain waves (EEG).

Research on ***quantified self*** is abundant. Wearable devices
including the Apple Watch, Oura Ring, Fitbit and others, combined with
apps, help users track a variety of health metrics. Apart from health,
wearable devices have been used to track other metrics such as
physiological parameters of students at school to determine their
learning efficiency (Giannakos et al., 2020).

Could one track personal sustainability in a similar fashion? (Shin et
al., 2019)’s synthesis review of 463 studies shows wearable devices have
potential to influence behavior change towards healthier lifestyles.
Saubade et al. (2016) finds health tracking is useful for motivating
physical activity.

Apple is a leader in health tracking. In 2022 Apple outlined plans for
***“empowering people to live a healthier day”*** and Apple’s HealthKit
provides a growing list of health metrics, which app developers can tap
into (Apple, 2022a, 2022b). Liu et al. (2019) tracks how wearable data
is used for tracking sleep improvements from exercise. Grigsby-Toussaint
et al. (2017) made use of sleep apps to construct humans behaviors also
known as ***behavioral constructs***.

-   Tracking blood sugar with app and patches. Blood sugar trackers.
    Blood glucose tracking is popular even for people without diabetes,
    to optimize their activity (Anon., 2021b)..

Another aspect is tracking one’s mental health. (Tyler, Boldi and
Cherubini, 2022) surveys the use of self-reflection apps in the UK
(n=998).

### Digital Sustainability

In digital sustainability, information pertaining to emissions would
flow through the economy not unlike the carbon cycle itself.

-   Pan and Nishant (2023) important

### Digital Product Design

Design is as much about how it works as it’s about the interface.

Digital product design can be seen as a specific discipline under the
umbrella of **Experience Design**. In Michael Abrash (2017) Meta Oculus
augmented reality incubation general manager Laura Fryer: *“People buy
experiences, not technology.”*

Young people expect a product. Intelligent Interfaces use interaction
design to provide relevant and personalized information in the right
context and at the right time.

Ceschin and Gaziulusoy (2016) shows how design for sustainability has
expanded from a product focus to systems-thinking focus placing the
product inside a societal context of use. For example Anon. (n.d.a),
recycled clothing maker FREITAG offers sustainability-focused services
such ass cargo bikes so you can transport your purchases and a network
for *shopping without payment* = swapping your items with other members,
as well as repairs of their products. Loaning terminology from
***service design***, the user journey within an app needs to consider
each touchpoint on the way to a state of success.

Weinschenk (2011) says *“People expect most online interactions to
follow the same social rules as person-to-person interactions. It’s a
shortcut that your brain uses to quickly evaluate trustworthiness.”*

The small screen estate space of mobiles phones and smart watches
necessitates displaying content in a dynamic manner. Virtual reality
glasses (called AR/VR or XR in marketing speak) need dynamic content
because the user is able to move around the environment. These are
questions that interaction design is called upon to solve. Hoang (2022):
*“Dynamic interfaces might invoke a new design language for extended
reality”.*

The promise of ***Generative UI*** is to dynamically provide an
interface appropriate for the particular user and context.

Speaking is one mode of interaction that’s become increasingly possible
as machines learn to interpret human language.

### Behavioral Design

For decades, marketers and researchers have been researching how to
affect human behavior towards increasing purchase decisions in commerce,
both offline and online, which is why the literature on behavioral
design is massive. One of the key concepts is *nudge*, first coined in
2008 by the Nobel-winning economist Richard Thaler; nudges are based on
a scientific understanding of human psychology and shortcuts and
triggers that human brains use and leverages that knowledge to influence
humans in small but powerful ways (Thaler and Sunstein, 2009).

The principles of nudge have also been applied to sustainability. For
example, a small study (n=33) in the Future Consumer Lab in Copenhagen
by Perez-Cueto (2021) found that designing a “dish-of-the-day” which was
prominently displayed helped to increase vegetarian food choice by 85%.
Guath, Stikvoort and Juslin (2022) experiments (n=200) suggested nudging
can be effective in influencing online shopping behavior towards more
sustainable options. A larger scale study of behavior change in
Australia maps how to avoid “16 billion paper coffee cups are being
thrown away every year” (Novoradovskaya et al., 2021).

Google uses nudges in Google Flights and Google maps, which allow
filtering flights and driving routes by the amount of CO<sub>2</sub>
emissions, as well as surfacing hotels with Green Key and EarthCheck
credentials, while promising new sustainability features across its
portfolio of products Sundar Pichai (2021). Such tools are small user
interface nudges which Google’s research calls *digital
decarbonization*, defined by Implement Consulting Group (2022) as
“Maximising the enabling role of digital technologies by accelerating
already available digital solutions”.

In Kate Brandt and Matt Brittin (2022), Google’s Chief Sustainability
Officer Kate Brandt set a target of “at least 20-25%” CO<sub>2</sub>
emission reductions in Europe to reach a net-zero economy and the global
announcement set a target of helping 1 billion people make more
sustainable choices around the world (Jeni Miles, 2022). In addition to
end–users, Google offers digital decarbonization software for
developers, including the Google Cloud Carbon Footprint tool and invests
in regenerative agriculture projects (Anon., 2021d; Google, 2023).

## Data-Driven Design Enables Sustainability

Sustainability touches every facet of human existence and is thus an
enormous undertaking. Making progress on sustainability is only possible
if there’s a large-scale coordinated effort by humans around the planet.
For this to happen, appropriate technological tools are required.

### Life-Centered Design

***Life-Centered Design*** recognizes human impact on our surrounding
environment as well as other animals making sure to include them among
stakeholders While ***Human-Centered Design*** has become popular, the
effect humans are having on biodiversity should be considered when
designing. *“\[T\]he design phase of a physical product accounts for 80%
of its environmental impact”* notes(Borthwick, Tomitsch and Gaughwin,
2022) in their framework for life-centered design.

-   Sanchez et al. (2022) LoRaWAN

### Interaction Design for Climate Change

Interaction Design for Climate Change: how can we change common UIs so
they take into account sustainability?

Popular blogs such as (Kohli, 2019) and (Lose, 2023a) offer many
suggestions how designers can help people become more sustainable in
their daily lives yet focusing on the end-user neglects the producers’
responsibility (termed as Extended Producer Responsibility or ERP) in
waste management studies.

    adaptation”
-   Andrew Chaisson (2019)
-   Dzigajev (2019)
-   Mankoff et al. (2007)
-   Borthwick, Tomitsch and Gaughwin (2022)
-   Lose (2023b) is worried about applying UX skills for Climate Change

#### Tracking Transport

Products are made from resources distributed across the planet and
transported to clients around the world which currently causes high
levels (and increasing) of greenhouse gases. *“Transport greenhouse gas
emissions have increased every year since 2014”* (Anon., 2023c). Freight
(transport of goods by trucks, trains, planes, ships) accounts for 1.14
gigatons of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions as per 2015 data or 16% of total
international supply chain emissions (Wang et al., 2022).

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[8] }} />

-   Platzer (2023), a scientist working on the Apollo space program,
    calls for emergency action to develop *green aviation*.

-   The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act which came into
    effect in 2012 applies to large retailers and manufacturers focused
    on pushing companies to to eradicate human trafficking and slavery
    in their supply chains.

-   The German Supply Chain Act (Gesetz über die unternehmerischen
    Sorgfaltspflichten zur Vermeidung von Menschenrechtsverletzungen in
    Lieferketten) enacted in 2021 requires companies to monitor
    violations in their supply chains (Stretton, 2022a;
    Bundesministerium für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und
    Entwicklung, 2023).

#### Tracing Supply Chains

Circular design is only possible if supply chains become circular as
well.

It’s important in which structure data is stored, affecting the ability
to efficiently access and manage the data while guaranteering a high
level of data integrity, security, as well as energy usage of said data.

The complexity of resource and delivery networks necessitates more
advanced tools to map supply chains (Knight et al., 2022). The COVID19
pandemic and resulting blockages in resource delivery highlighted the
need to have real-time visibility into supply chains (Finkenstadt and
Handfield, 2021).

Blockchains are a special type of database where the data is stored in
several locations with a focus on making the data secure and very
difficult to modify after it’s been written to the database. Once data
is written to the blockchain, modifying it would require changing all
subsquent records in the chain and agreement of the majority of
validators who host a version of the database.

Blockchain is the main technology considered for accounting for the
various inputs and complex web of interactions between many participants
inside the supply chain networks. There are hundreds of paper
researching blockchain use in supply change operations since 2017 (Dutta
et al., 2020). Blockchains enable saving immutable records into
distributed databases (also known as ledgers). It’s not possible to (or
extremely difficult) to change the same record, only new records can be
added on top of new ones. Blockchains are useful for data sharing and
auditing, as the time and place of data input can be guaranteed, and it
will be easier to conduct a search on who inputted incorrect data;
however the system still relies on correct data input. As the saying
goes, *“garbage in, garbage out”*.

There are several technologies for tracking goods across the supply
chain, from shipping to client delivery. Data entry is a combination of
manual data input and automated record-keeping facilitated by sensors
and integrated internet of things (IoT) capabilities. For example
(Ashraf and Heavey, 2023) describes using the Solana blockchain and
Sigfox internet of things (IoT) Integration for supply chain
traceability where Sigfox does not need direct access to internet but
can send low powered messages across long distances (for example
shipping containers on the ocean). (Van Wassenaer et al., 2023) compares
use cases for blockchains in enhancing traceability, transparency and
cleaning up the supply chain in agricultural products.

    factories and product movements from factories to markets.

    Ethereum blockchain and animal rights. “Blockchain can provide a
    transparent, immutable record of the provenance of products. This

    “organic,” or “sustainably sourced” could have their entire
    lifecycle recorded on the blockchain, from birth to shelf, allowing
    consumers to verify these claims.”

Data-driven design requires access to data, making the movement towards
*open data sharing* very important. Some countries and cities are better
than others at sharing data openly.

#### Taxes

-   There have been proposal of a “meat tax”.

#### Carbon Labels

Adding CO<sub>2</sub> labels for consumer products have been discussed
for decades (Adam Corner, 2012). Cohen and Vandenbergh (2012) argues
carbon labels do influence consumer choice towards sustainability.
Academic literature has looked at even minute detail such as color and
positioning of the label (Zhou et al. (2019)). There is some indication
consumers are willing to pay a small premium for low-CO<sub>2</sub>
products (Xu and Lin (2022)). All else being equal, consumers choose the
option with a lower CO<sub>2</sub> number (Carlsson, Kataria and Lampi
(2022)). Nonetheless, the idea of *Carbon Labelling* is yet to find
mainstream adoption.

There’s some evidence to suggest labeling low CO<sub>2</sub> food
enables people to choose a *climatarian diet* in a large-scale study
Lohmann et al. (2022) of UK university students, however the impact of
carbon labels on the market share of low-carbon meals is negligible.
Labels alone are not enough. underlines Edenbrandt and Lagerkvist (2022)
in Sweden in a study which found a negative correlation between worrying
about climate impact and interest in climate information on products;
this finding may be interpreted suggesting a need for wider
environmental education programs. Asioli et al. (2022) found differences
between countries, where Spanish and British consumers chose meat
products with *‘No antibiotics ever’* over a *Carbon Trust* label,
whereas French consumers chose CO<sub>2</sub> labeled meat products.

Carbon labeling is voluntary and practiced by only a handful of
companies. The U.S. restaurant chain *Just Salad* , U.K.-based vegan
meat-alternative *Quorn* and plant milk *Oatly* are some example of
companies that provide carbon labeling on their products (Brian Kateman,
2020). ClimatePartner (2020): Companies like ClimatePartner and Carbon
Calories offers labeling consumer goods with emission data as a service.
The Carbon Trust (n.d.): The Carbon Trust reports it’s certified 27
thousand product footprints.

#### Digital Product Passports

-   Circularise has been working on a blockchain-based sustainability
    solution since 2016 and is the market leader providing Digital
    Product Passports for improving transparency across several
    industries Stretton (2022b) “Ecodesign for Sustainable Products
    Regulation (part of the Sustainable Products Initiative) and one of
    the key actions under the Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP). The
    goal of this initiative is to lay the groundwork for a gradual
    introduction of a digital product passport in at least three key
    markets by 2024” “Connecting the Value Chain, One Product at a Time”
    “Circularise aims to overcome the communication barrier that is
    limiting the transition to a circular economy with an open,

Digital product passports are a further development of the idea of
carbon labels.

-   The European Commision has proposed a *Digital Product Passports* to
    help companies transfer environmental data (Nissinen, Seppälä and
    Heinonen, 2022). Carbon labels are needed for green transformation.

## Re-Designing Industries for Provenance and Traceability

It’s possible to re-design entire industries and that is exactly the
expectation sustainability sets on businesses. Across all industries,
there’s a call for more transparency. Conversations about sustainability
are too general and one needs to look at the specific sustainability
metrics at specific industries to be able to design for meaningful
interaction. There’s plentiful domain-specific research showing how
varied industries can develop eco-designed products. I will here focus
on 2 industries that are relevant for college students.

### Sustainable Fashion

Young people are the largest consumers of fast fashion (Anon., n.d.k).
(In European Environment Agency, 2022 European Environment Agency (EEA))
estimates based on trade and production data that EU27 citizens consumed
an average 15kg of textile products per person per year.

-   **Problem**: Emily Chan (2022a) report says there’s not enough
    transparency in fashion:

    million plates of sushi. in Taiwan”

#### Perennial Crops

-   Multi-year crops reduce inputs of gasoline, labor, etc. Aubrey
    Streit Krug and Yin Lu (2023)

-   Large agritech like Monsanto rely on selling seeds annualy for
    profits, which has lead to farmer suicides when crops fail.

#### Culture, Community, Cuisine, Storytelling

-   Tsing (2015) mushrooms

Food is about enticing human imagination and taste buds.

-   Potato used to be a newcomer and innovative crop in Europe, and not
    it’s so common, we forget it’s no originally from here.

-   Aubrey Streit Krug and Yin Lu (2023) food is also about cuisine and
    culture; foods become popular if we hear stories and see cuisine
    around a particular crop.

-   “The agricultural sector contributes to approximately 13.5% of the
    total global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and accounts for
    25% of the total CO<sub>2</sub> emission” Nabipour Afrouzi et al.
    (2023). Poore and Nemecek (2018) suggests 26% of carbon emissions
    come from food production. Saner et al. (2015) reports dairy (46%)
    and meat and fish (29%) products making up the largest GHG emission
    potential. Springmann et al. (2021) proposes veganism is the most
    effective decision to reduce personal CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.

Complex supply chains make seafood (marine Bivalvia, mollusks) logistics
prone to fraud, leading to financial losses and threats to consumer
health (Santos et al., 2023). The same is true for cocoa beans, which
are at risk from food fraud (Fanning et al., 2023).

#### Food Waste

There are several initiatives to reduce food waste by helping people
consume food that would otherwise be throw away.

-   Food Sovereignty: “The global food sovereignty movement, which had
    been building momentum since its grassroots conception in the late
    ’90s, quickly gained traction with its focus on the rights of people
    everywhere to access healthy and sustainable food. One of the
    pillars of the movement lies in using local food systems to reduce
    the distance between producers and consumers.”

-   CAITLIN STALL-PAQUET (2021): “We can grow foods just as well in the
    inner city as we can out in the country because we’re agnostic to
    arable land,” says Woods. “Because we grow indoors and create our
    own weather, \[climate change\] doesn’t affect our produce.”

#### Farm to Fork

Farm to fork is a European Union policy to shorten the supply chain from
the producer to the consumer and add transparency to the system.

Supply chain innovation in agriculture.

### Sustainable Construction

-   According to Debnath et al. (2022) 39% of global CO<sub>2</sub>
    emissions comes from the building sector.
-   Construction is large emitter because of the use of concrete; super
    tall buildings are very CO<sub>2</sub> intensive (Zhao and Qin,
    2015).
-   embodied carbon
-   Oikos Denktank (2021) circular material procurement requires new
    skills. How to reuse old paint? Small projects can have large social
    impact.
-   For example, Duriez et al. (2022) shows how simply by reducing
    material weight it’s possible to design more sustainable
    transportation.
