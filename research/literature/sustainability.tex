\subsection{Evolving Sustainability Measurments from Planetary
Boundaries to Planetary
Health}\label{evolving-sustainability-measurments-from-planetary-boundaries-to-planetary-health}

\emph{Sustainability} was first mentioned in the seminal book
\emph{Sylvicultura oeconomica} in the context of forestry with the goal
of achieving sustainable forest management (Hannß Carl von Carlowitz,
1713). The field is known today as \emph{sustainable yield} of
\emph{natural capital} with a focus on maintaining \emph{ecosystem
services} (Peter Kareiva et al., 2011). Aldo Leopold proposed the idea
of \emph{land ethics} as \emph{``{[}a{]} thing is right when it tends to
preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community.
It is wrong when it tends otherwise''} in his landmark work \emph{A Sand
County Almanac} (Leopold, 1972). The 1987 United Nations' Brundtland
Report (Our Common Future) defined sustainable development as
\emph{``Development that meets the needs of the present without
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own
needs''} (World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987).

In 1896, the Nobel Prize winner Svante Arrhenius first calculated how an
increase in CO\textsubscript{2} levels could have a warming effect on
our global climate (Anderson, Hawkins and Jones, 2016; Wulff, 2020). 120
years later, the Paris Climate Agreement came into effect, with
countries agreeing on non-binding targets on how to keep
CO\textsubscript{2} levels 1.5 °C below pre-industrial levels (United
Nations, 2016). While awareness of Earth's warming climate was growing,
the CO\textsubscript{2} emissions kept rising too. The hockey-stick
growth of CO\textsubscript{2} concentration since the industrial
revolution is clear in the data from 1958 onward, following a steady
annual increase, called the \emph{Keeling Curve} (Keeling and Keeling,
2017). Written records of global temperature measurements are available
starting from the 1880s when documentation of temperatures become
available in ship records (Brohan et al., 2012). Temperature estimations
from tree-trunks allow some temperature comparisons with the climate as
far back as 2000 years ago (Rubino et al., 2019).

\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{./images/co2-concentration.png}

}

\caption{CO\textsubscript{2} concentration in the atmosphere as of Ap.

\end{figure}%

In 1938, Guy Stewart Callendar was the first to demonstrate the warming
of Earth's land surface as well as linking the production of fossil
fuels to increased CO\textsubscript{2} and changing climate (Hawkins and
Jones, 2013). By the latest data from 2022, the current world population
of 8 Billion people emitted 37.5 gigatonnes of CO\textsubscript{2} per
year, the highest emissions recorded in history (Statista, 2023). To
limit global warming to 1.5 °C as agreed by the world nations in Paris,
removal of 5-20 gigatons of CO\textsubscript{2} per year would be needed
according to reduction pathways calculated by the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (Wade et al., 2023). Yet, most countries
are missing the mark. Given this model of climate change, the G7
countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, United
States) are heading for 2.7 °C of warming by 2050 (CDP, 2022). The
monumental task of removing several gigatons of CO\textsubscript{2} from
the atmosphere requires massive policy shifts and collaboration across
countries and industries (Mackler, Fishman and Broberg, 2021).

News reports saying quoting the ``The European Union's Copernicus
Climate Change Service (C3S)'' 1.5 has already been breached (Anon.,
2024a; Anon., 2024b).

In 1948, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) was
founded, which in

LULUCF ``Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry'' can be a source of
greenhouse gas emissions or a carbon sink (removing CO2 from the
atmosphere)

al.~2015}

\end{figure}%

In addition the enormity of emissions, humanity is facing other massive
problems. The Stockholm Resilience Centre reports we have already
breached 4 out of our 9 planetary boundaries: in addition to climate
change, biodiversity loss (Extinctions per Million Species per Year aka
E/MSY), land-system change (deforestation, land degradation, etc), and
biogeochemical flows (cycles of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, etc); on a
positive side, the challenges of fresh water use, ocean acidification
and stratospheric ozone depletion are still within planetary limits
(Persson et al., 2022).

Atmospheric aerosol loading and the biodiversity intactness index (BII)
were quantified recently (ADD CITATION)

\item
  We also need to consider environmental effects (E in ESG). We haven't
  taken into account the whole cost of production, leading to the wrong
  pricing information. To achieve this, we need expert governance (G).
\end{itemize}

Consumer lifestyle contributes to environmental destruction. According
to Ellen MacArthur Foundation, Material Economics (2019)'s models show
45\% of CO\textsubscript{2} equivalent emissions come from our shopping;
produced by companies to make the products we consume. A large scale
study by Anthony Leiserowitz et al. (2022) on Meta's Facebook (n=108946)
reported people in Spain (65\%), Sweden (61\%), and Taiwan (60\%)
believe \emph{``climate change is mostly caused by human activities''.}
An even larger survey (n=1.2 million) by the United Nations across 50
countries, distributed through mobile game ads, showed the majority of
people agreeing climate change is an ``emergency'' UNDP (2021). While
people express eco-conscious ideas, it's non-trivial to practice
sustainability in daily life. Deyan Georgiev (2023) reports only 30\% of
people in the Gen-Z age group believe technology can solve all problems.

Sustainability can be measured using a variety of
\textbf{\emph{ecological indicators}}.

Some argue sustainability is not enough and we should work on
regeneration of natural habitats.

\subsubsection{The Climate}\label{the-climate}

\paragraph{The Price of Climate
Change}\label{the-price-of-climate-change}

Long term cost is more than short-term gains.

\paragraph{Climate Data Vizualisation}\label{climate-data-vizualisation}

Climate data visualization has a long history, starting with
\textbf{\emph{Alexander von Humboldt,}} the founder of climatology, who
revolutionized cartography by inventing the first \emph{isothermal maps}
around the year 1816; these maps showed areas with similar temperature,
variations in altitude and seasons in different colors (Honton, 2022).
Humboldt's isotherms are now available as 3D computer models in (Anon.,
2023a).

Earth's physical systems are very sensitive to small changes in
temperature, which was not understood until 30 years ago (McKibben,
2006).

\subsubsection{Climatech}\label{climatech}

How are large corporations responding to the climate crisis?

Lack of leadership. Capgemini (2022): ``Many business leaders see
sustainability as costly obligation rather than investment in the
future''. Hoikkala (2019): for example the CEO of the Swedish clothing
producer H\&M, one of the largest fast-fashion in the world, recognizes
the potential impact of conscious consumers as a threat.

Many large businesses have tried to find solutions by launching
climate-focused funding. (Korosec, 2021) reports that Amazon's 2B USD to
a Climate Pledge Fund earmarked to fix climate problems is invested in
energy, logistics, and packaging startups, which will reduce material
waste. ``Good intentions don't work, mechanisms do,'' Amazon's founder
Bezos is quoted as saying in (Clifford, 2022). Walmart is taking a
similar approach, having launched a project in 2017 to set
CO\textsubscript{2} reduction targets in collaboration with its
suppliers Walmart (2023). These examples underlines how money marketed
as climate funding by retail conglomerates means focus on reducing
operational cost of running their business through automation and
material savings.

Large corporations such as Nestle and Coca Cola support the biodiversity
law to have a level playing field for business (Greens EFA, 2023).

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Anon. (2013)
\item
  Guidotti (2015)
\item
  ``Sustainability is important for many reasons including:
  Environmental Quality --~In order to have healthy communities, we need
  clean air, natural resources, and a nontoxic environment.''
\item
  Low, S., Baum and Sovacool (2022) finds considerable uncertainty
  exists among experts which CO2 reduction methods among nature-based
  and technology-based are the most effective.
\item

\subsubsection{Ecosystem Services Enable Life on
Earth}\label{ecosystem-services-enable-life-on-earth}

Gómez-Baggethun et al. (2010) the history of the valuation of nature's
services goes back to the 18th century when David Ricardo and Jean
Baptiste Say discussed nature's \emph{work}, however both considered it
should be free. In 1997 Daily (1997) proposed the idea of ecosystem
services and Costanza et al. (1997) attempted to assess the amount of
ecosystem services provided.

Le Provost et al. (2022) study shows \emph{biodiversity} as one key
factor to maintain delivery of ecosystem services. Noriega et al. (2018)
attempts to quantify the ecosystem services (ES) provided by insects.
While it can be assumed much of the flora and fauna are crucial for
Earth's systems, science is still in the process of understanding and
quantifying its contributions.

\item
  Leverhulme Centre for Nature Recovery (2023) should we put a price on
  nature?
\item

\paragraph{Growing Population and
Overpopulation}\label{growing-population-and-overpopulation}

Earth's population reached 8 Billion people In November 2022 and
population projections by predict 8.5B people by 2030 and 9.7B by 2050
(The Economic Times, 2022; United Nations Department of Economic and
Social Affairs, Population Division, 2022).

(Hassoun et al., 2023) forecasts increase of global food demand by 62\%
including impact of climate change.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  While population growth puts higher pressure on Earth's resources,
  some research proposes the effect is more from wasteful lifestyles
  than the raw number of people (Cardinale et al., 2012).
\item
  Bowler et al. (2020) Anthropogenic Threat Complexes (ATCs):

  ``Overpopulation is a major cause of biodiversity loss and smaller
  human populations are necessary to preserve what is left'' Cafaro,
  Hansson and Götmark (2022).

\paragraph{Marine Heatwaves}\label{marine-heatwaves}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Gelles and Andreoni (2023) describe how marine heatwaves threaten
  global biodiversity.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Slavery Still Exists}\label{slavery-still-exists}

In 2023, an estimated 50 million people are still in slavery around the
world; lack of supply chain visibility hides forced labor and
exploitation of undocumented migrants in agricultural work; 71\% of
enslaved people are estimated to be women. (Borrelli et al., 2023; Kunz
et al., 2023).

The UN SDG target 8.7 targets to eliminate all forms of slavery.

Slavery is connected to environmental degradation and climate change
(Decker Sparks et al., 2021). Enslaved people are used in environmental
crimes such as 40\% of deforestation globally. Cobalt used in
technological products is in risk of being produced under forced labor
in the D.R. Congo (Sovacool, 2021). In India and Pakistan, forced labor
in brick kiln farms is possible to capture remotely from satellite

\paragraph{Overconsumption Drive Climate
Change}\label{overconsumption-drive-climate-change}

Overconsumption is one of the main drivers of climate change.'' Around
2/3 of global GHG emissions are directly and indirectly linked to
household consumption, with a global average of about 6 tonnes
CO\textsubscript{2} equivalent per capita.'' (Ivanova et al., 2020;
Renee Cho, 2020)

Overconsumption is also one of the root causes of plastic pollution.
Ford et al. (2022) and Lavers, Bond and Rolsky (2022) find strong
linkage of climate change and marine plastic pollution ``along with
other stressors that threaten the resilience of species and habitats
sensitive to both climate change and plastic pollution''.

Biodiversity loss is linked to overconsumption, weak legislation and
lack of oversight. (Crenna, Sinkko and Sala, 2019) recounts European
Union consumers' negative impact on biodiversity in countries where it
imports food. WWF (2022) case study highlights how 4 biodiverse regions
Cerrado in Brazil, Chaco in Argentina, Sumatra in Indonesia, and the
Cuvette Centrale in Democratic Republic of Congo are experiencing rapid
destruction due to consumer demand in the European Union. While the
European Union (EU) has recently become a leader in sustainability
legislation, biodiversity protection measures among private companies is
very low Marco-Fondevila and Álvarez-Etxeberría (2023).

Meanwhile, there is some progress in biodiversity conservation. UEBT
(2022) reports ``Biodiversity awareness is now at 72\% or higher in all
countries sampled, compared to only 29\% or higher across countries
sampled in 2009.''

Similarly to climate protection, the UN has taken a leadership role in
biodiversity protection. Unit (2023): The history of the United Nations
Convention on Biodiversity goes back to 1988, when the working group was
founded. UNEP (Tue, 12/20/2022 - 07:44): The Convention on Biodiversity
2022 (COP15) adopted the first global biodiversity framework to
accompany climate goals.

Cutting edge research uses AI for listening to nature, assessing
biodiversity based on species' sounds in the forest. Millions of
detections of different species with machine learning passive acoustic
AI models, can also assess species response to climate change (AI for

\paragraph{Forest and Deforestion}\label{forest-and-deforestion}

Around 27\% of Earth's land area is still covered by forests yet
deforestation is widespread all around the world; highest rates of
deforestation happened in the tropical rainforests of South America and
Africa, mainly caused by agricultural cropland expansion (50\% of all
deforestation) and grazing land for farm animals to produce meat
(38,5\%), totaling close to 90\% of global deforestation (Anon., 2022a).
Forests are a crucial part of Earth's carbon cycle and the main natural
CO\textsubscript{2} capture system; due to deforestation, Europe rapidly
losing its forest carbon sink (Frédéric Simon, 2022).

Afforestation is different from reforestation, which takes into account
biodiversity.

Air pollution is widespread around the planet, with 99\% of Earth's
human population being affected by bad air quality that does not meet
WHO air quality guidelines, leading to health problems linked to 6.7
million premature deaths every year World Health Organization (2022).
Grounbreaking research by Lim et al. (2022) analyzed over 400000
individuals in England, South Korea and Taiwan establishes exposure to
2.5μm PM (PM2.5) air pollution as a cause for lung cancer. Bouscasse et
al. (2022) finds strong health and economic benefits across the board
from air pollution reduction in France. In Hannah Devlin (2022), prof
Tony Mok, of the Chinese University of Hong Kong: ``We have known about
the link between pollution and lung cancer for a long time, and we now
have a possible explanation for it. As consumption of fossil fuels goes
hand in hand with pollution and carbon emissions, we have a strong
mandate for tackling these issues -- for both environmental and health
reasons''.

Health and sustainability are inextricably linked. ``Human health is
central to all sustainability efforts.'', ``All of these (food, housing,
power, and health care), and the~stress~that the lack of them generate,
play a huge role in our health'' (Sarah Ludwig Rausch and Neha Pathak,
2021).

The main way to combat air pollution is through policy interventions.
MARIA LUÍS FERNANDES (2023) EU has legislation in progress to curb
industrial emissions. If legislation is in place, causing bad air
quality can become bad for business. Gu et al. (2023) links air
pollution to credit interest rates for business loans in China;
companies with low environmetal awareness and a history of environmental
penalties pay 12 percent higher interest rates.

Clean air is a requirement.

Global warming increases the risk of disasters and extreme weather
events. As extreme temperatures are increasingly commonplace, there's
increased risk of wildfires (Volkova, Roxburgh and Weston, 2021).
Summers of 2022 and 2023 were the hottest on record so far, with extreme
heat waves recorded in places around the world (Douglas, 2023; Falconer,
2023; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), U.S.
Department of Commerce, 2023; NOAA National Centers for Environmental
Information, 2023; Serrano-Notivoli et al., 2023; Venturelli et al.,
2023). As temperatures rise, certain cities may become uninhabitable for
humans (CBC Radio, 2021). The summer of 2023 saw extensive wildfires in
Spain, Canada, and elsewhere; rapidly moving fires destroyed the whole
city of Lāhainā in Hawaii {[}ADD CITATION{]}. The part of Earth where
the \emph{human climate niche} is becoming smaller (McKibben, 2023).
Some parts of South America have seen summer heat in the winter, with
heatwaves with temperatures as high as 38 degrees (Livingston, 2023).

Voluntary Carbon Markets are \ldots{}

Voluntary Carbon Markets (VCM) lack standardization and transparency
(Ela Khodai, 2023).

\textbf{\emph{Carbon Credits}} are useful for private companies who wish
to claim \emph{carbon neutrality, climate positivity}, or other related
claim, which might be viewed in good light by their clients or allow the
companies to adhere to certain legislative requirements.

There are many companies which facilitate buy carbon credits as well as
a few organizations focused on carbon credit verification.

\paragraph{Fossil Fuels}\label{fossil-fuels}

Fossil fuels are what powers humanity as well as the largest source of
CO\textsubscript{2} emissions. IEA (2022) reports ``Global
CO\textsubscript{2} emissions from energy combustion and industrial
processes rebounded in 2021 to reach their highest ever annual level. A
6\% increase from 2020 pushed emissions to 36.3 gigatonnes''. As on June
2023, fossil fuel based energy makes up 82\% of energy and is still
growing Institute (2023). The 425 largest fossil fuel projects represent
a total of over 1 gigatons in CO\textsubscript{2} emissions, 40\% of
which were new projects Kühne et al. (2022). Tilsted et al. (2023)
expects the fossil fuel industry to continue grow even faster. In July
2023, the U.K. granted hundreds of new oil and gas of project licenses
in the North Sea (Anon., 2023d).

\paragraph{Renewable Energy}\label{renewable-energy}

\begin{itemize}

There's ample evidence from several countries suggesting moving to

\begin{itemize}
\item

  intra-sectoral electricity price distortions coupled with carbon taxes
  provides the highest benefits'' for both the economy and the

\paragraph{Emission Scopes Organize Calculating
CO2e}\label{emission-scopes-organize-calculating-co2e}

The U.S. National Public Utilities Council (NPUC) decarbonization report
provides a useful categorization of \textbf{\emph{emission scopes}}
applicable to companies and for organizing emission reduction schemes
(National Public Utilities Council, 2022). For example, for consumers in
Australian states and territories in 2018, 83\% of the GHG emissions are
Scope 3, meaning indirect emissions in the value chain Goodwin et al.
(2023).

\paragraph{Carbon Capture}\label{carbon-capture}

Many technology startups focused on climate solutions (often referred to
as climatech by the media), have proposed a range of approaches to
CO\textsubscript{2} reduction in the atmosphere.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Vitillo et al. (2022) illustrates how direct air capture of
  CO\textsubscript{2} is difficult because of low concentration and
  CO\textsubscript{2} capture at the source of the emissions is more
  feasible.
\item
  Gaure and Golombek (2022) simulate a CO\textsubscript{2} free
  electricity generation system in the European Union where ``98\% of
  total electricity production is generated by wind power and solar; the
  remainder is covered by a backup technology.''. The authors stipulate
  it's possible to power the EU without producing CO\textsubscript{2}
  emissions.
\item

\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{Social Cost of Carbon Measures Compound

Sustainability is filled with complexities, where CO\textsubscript{2}
emission is compounded by biodiversity loss, child labor, slavery,
poverty, prostitution, dangerous chemicals, and many other issues become
intertwined (TEDx Talks, 2020). One attempt to measure these
complexities, is the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) which is defined as
``additional damage caused by an extra unit of emissions'' (Zhen, Tian
and Ye, 2018; Kornek et al., 2021). For example the cost of damages
caused by ``one extra ton of carbon dioxide emissions'' (Stanford
University, 2021). SCC variations exists between countries (Tol, 2019)
and regions (Wang, Y., Ma and Wang, 2022).

\begin{itemize}

  As shown in the Phillipines by (Cheng and Han, 2022), with increasing
  extreme weather events, ``businesses are more likely to emerge in
  areas where infrastructure is resilient to climate hazards''.
  (Jerrett, Jina and Marlier, 2022) says, In California, ``Wildfires are
  the second most important source of emissions in 2020'' and
  ``Wildfires in 2020 negate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from
  other sectors.''
\item
  (Lin et al., 2022) says, apart from CO\textsubscript{2}, reduction of
  other atmospheric pollutants, such as non-CO\textsubscript{2}
  greenhouse gases (GHGs) and short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) is
  required for climate stability.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In 2019 by the von der Leyen commission adopted the European Union
  (EU) \textbf{Green Deal} strategy.
\item
  In 2021 the Commision proposed a goal of reducing CO2e emissions by
  55\% by 2030 under the \emph{Fit for 55} policy package consisting of
  a wide range of economic measures.
\item
  In November 2022, the proposal was adopted by the EU Council and EU
  Parliament with an updated goal of 57\% of CO2e reductions compared to
  1990. This proposal is set to become a binding law for all EU member
  countries (European Commission (2019a); European Commission (2019b);
  Anon. (2022c); European Council (2022)).
\item
  In March 2022, the EU Circular Economy Action Plan was adopted,
  looking to make sustainable products \emph{the norm} in EU and
  \emph{empowering consumers} as described in European Commission
  (2022b). Each product covered by the policy is required to have a
  \textbf{\emph{Digital Product Passport}} which enables improved
  processing within the supply chain and includes detailed information
  to empower consumers to understand the environmental footprint of
  their purchases. It's safe to say the large majority of products
  available today do not meet these criteria.

Liu, K. et al. (2023) reports, e--waste is growing 3\%--5\% every year,
globally. (Thukral and Singh, 2023) identifies several barriers to
e-waste management among producers including lack of awareness and
infrastructure, attitudinal barriers, existing \emph{informal} e-waste
sector, and the need for an e-waste license.

\subsubsection{Extended Producer Responsibility Enables Compannies to be
Resposible}\label{extended-producer-responsibility-enables-compannies-to-be-resposible}

Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is a policy tool first proposed
by Thomas Lindhqvist in Sweden in 1990 {[}ADD CITATION{]}, aimed to
encourage producers take responsibility for the entire life-cycle of
their products, thus leading to more eco-friendly products. Nonetheless,
EPR schemes do not guarantee circularity and may instead be designed
around fees to finance waste management in linear economy models
(Christiansen, Hasse and Tønder, 2021). The French EPR scheme was
upgraded in 2020 to become more circular (Jacques Vernier, 2021).

In any case, strong consumer legislation (such as EPR) has a direct
influence on producers' actions. For example, in HKTDC Research (2022),
the Hong Kong Trade Development Council notified textile producers in
July 2022 reminding factories to produce to French standards in order to
be able enter the EU market. Peng, Shi and Tong (2023) finds that the
\textbf{\emph{Carbon Disclosure Project}} has been a crucial tool to
empower ERP in Chinese auto-producers.
