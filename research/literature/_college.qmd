# Young Adults and College Students

Taiwan has approximately 2 million young adults (Gen-Z, 18-26), and 73% percent of them are students attending tertiary education as of 2023, with a slow increase of enrollment over the past decade [@ministryofeducationoftaiwanNetEnrollmentRate2024].

```{python}
genz_enrollment_chart()
```

As of 2024, Taiwan has a total of 148 universities, colleges, and junior colleges [@ministryofeducationoftaiwanUniversitiesCollegesJunior2024]. Education funding is 4.26% of Taiwan's GDP in 2023-24 and has been on a decline for a decade [@ministryofeducationoftaiwanMainEducationStatistical2024]. Taiwan has an aging population and declining birth rates have forced several schools to close down [@gohLongrunMacroeconomicConsequences2023; @davidsonEmptyClassroomsSilent2024].

## Designing for College Students: Developing Personas

Students in the Generation-Z age bracket (abbreviated as Gen-Z or Zoomers) are born between 1997 and 2012 [@brankavuletaGenerationStatistics2023]. High levels of technology adoption worldwide [@deyangeorgiev39SmartphoneStatistics2023]. Over 98% of Gen-Z owns a smartphone while only 80% of the general world population does [@globalwebindex98GenOwn2017; @bankmycellHowManyPeople2022].

Designing for College Students: Developing Personas. User research makes extensive use of user *personas* to represent a group of people with similar attributes. Designers use personas to *articulate assumptions,* which, if used well, is useful for *user-centered design*, to create better products. Personas help to reflect on what kind of *biases* might exist in the design. Within the larger cohort of college students several different personas could be defined, for example grouping people by interests, knowledge, habits, levels of anxiety, and other attributes. Humans have a long list of cognitive biases, which a good design should take into account.

Many general observations can be made, however to create meaningful personas, these should be backed up with data. Students ride bicycles and scooters. Many circular economy service such as YouBike and transport sharing platforms like Uber are available in Taiwan. Many students live in dorms and shared housing, meaning their impact per square meter is low.

## Taiwanese Youth in the Global Context: Global and Local Attitudes Towards Sustainability

Addressing the Research Gap When it Comes to Taiwanese College Students. There's lack of scientific research when it comes to Taiwanese college students, not only in English or other foreign languages, but also in Chinese. Much of the research in Taiwan focuses on younger students, particularly those in primary and secondary schools. With regards to issues related to college students and sustainability, even less research is available. My project hopes to shed some light to how Taiwanese college students relate to sustainability.

[@kuo-huachenTransformingEnvironmentalValues2019] compares Taiwan to other countries in terms of Postmaterialist Index Comparison, noting Taiwanese society is materialistic.

```

World Values Survey

```{python}

```

[@franzenDevelopmentGlobalEnvironmental2024] measures *"mean environmental concern"* to look at decade-level changes in societal environmental attitudes across countries. Taiwan's general attitudes have stayed almost the same (slight increase). The UK has had the largest jump in concern. Curiously, South Korea has had a slight decrease in concern. Slovakia and Russia were not very concerned with the environment a decade ago and are even less concerned now.

A large-scale global study by [@anthonyleiserowitzInternationalPublicOpinion2022] administered on Meta's Facebook (n=108946) reported people in Spain (65%), Sweden (61%), and Taiwan (60%) believe *"climate change is mostly caused by human activities".*

```{python}
mean_global_attitudes()
```

The largest study to date, conducted by the United Nations across 50 countries, surveying 1.2 million people, distributed through mobile game ads, showed the majority of people agreeing climate change is an *"emergency"* [@undpPeoplesClimateVote2021].

## Student Protests: In Taiwan vs Around the World

In August 2018, Swedish high-school student Greta Thunberg skipped class to start a climate strike in front of the Swedish parliament Riksdag. Millions of people around the world joined her *Fridays for Future* protests. Time magazine named Thunberg person of the year for *creating a global attitudinal shift.* [@deutschewelleFridaysFutureGlobal2019].

In Taiwan, the Fridays for Future protests were small in scale, with no more than 100-200 people [@hioeFridaysFutureProtest2019]. Meanwhile 2000 Taiwanese students joined the initative by participating in environmental activities without protesting [@daiQuanQiuXueShengQiHouYunDongTaiWanXueShengZouChuZiJiDeLu2019]; Meanwhile Indonesia, Philippines, have had larger protests.

```
This could in part be explained by Taiwanese culture being deeply influenced by Confucianism, valuing academic excellence, effort, and the role of education in achieving social status [@xuDeclinedQualityPoststructural2024]. Both Confucianism and Daoism affect education to be *teacher-centered*, where traditionally the role of students is to listen and absorb knowledge; in today's society, there's space to open opportunities for revisiting *dialogue-based* education, where students would be encouraged to take a more active role and gain ownership of their education [@changExploringDialogicEducation2023].

### Sustainability Attitudes from Eco-Friendly Diet to Climate Action

At the pre-university level, Taiwanese government has been promoting environmental education through a green school network; however surveys at middle school and high school level suggest there is no impact on *sustainability consciousness* among students in comparison with regular schools [@olssonGreenSchoolsTaiwan2019]. Rather, Taiwanese students are influenced towards environmental action by *group consciousness* [@yuUnderstandingTaiwaneseUndergraduate2017]. In contrast,[@GuoZhongXueShengWeiLi2003] reports *good knowledge of sustainable development* topics among *junior high school students* in Da-an District, Taipei City (n=596). [@GaoZhongXueShengWeiLi2009] similarly reports a positive attitude and good knowledge of environmental sustainable development among senior *high school students* towards in Taipei City (n=328). Several Taiwanese studies also focus on the physical environment of school campuses, for example the sustainability of elementary school campuses [@YanJiu2006]. Elementary-school teachers in Taichung (n=536), have positive attitudes towards environmental education are positive, proactive and demonstrate high awareness; they have participated in many sustainability-related workshops [@liaoElementaryTeachersEnvironmental2022].

At the university level, [@chenMarineEnvironmentalAwareness2016] reports a *positive attitude yet moderate knowledge* about *ocean sustainability* among Taiwanese college students (n=825). [@liuDigitalCapabilityDigital2023] studied sustainability behavior of Taiwanese University students, reporting the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to prevalence of health issues, also spurred more attention on environmental topics. In a similar vein, the devastating nuclear disaster in Fukushima, Japan, after 2011 earthquake, had an effect on Taiwanese energy and sustainability education [@TiChuTan2011]. Taiwanese government launched the Sustainable Council in 1997 to promote of environmental and sustainable development; a survey of university-level teachers (n=100) in central Taiwan (Taichung, Changhua, and Yunlin) shows a positive attitude toward environmental sustainability among teachers however implementation of environmental sustainability practices is from low to medium range [@FenXi2015]. Taiwanese government has also launched funding for University Social Responsibility (USR) programs to train college students in social innovation and local revitalization [@chenSocialInnovationTaiwan2023; @liuRolesTaiwaneseUniversities2022].

In general, it could concluded, Taiwanese students and teachers at all levels of education have a positive attitude towards sustainability, which is not a very actionable finding.

Comparing college students' education for sustainable development (ESD) in Taiwan (n=617) and Sweden (n=583) found Sweden has a long history in environmental education while in Taiwan environment became a focus area with the 1998 educational reform [@berglundCrossculturalComparativeStudy2020].

```{python}

An older study in 5 university in Taipei and Taichung (n=255) found 78.04% of respondents consumed beef in the month prior and were concerned with food safety, freshness, and quality [@hsuEffectFamilyBeef2014]. [@thiagarajahPlantbasedDietsWhat2017] reports a general observation in their abstract (I was unable to access the full study) that most college students in all observed countries including Taiwan (n=534) regarded "*plant-based diets to have health benefits"*.

Internationally, there is extensive research on the attitudes of U.S. college students towards climate change. [@americanpressinstituteKnowingNewsHow2022] reports only 37% percent of U.S. Generation-Z and Millenials follow news related to environmental issues. [@schwartzClimateChangeAnxiety2022] reports some adult US students in a small study (18-35, n = 284) express feelings of insignificance of their actions to achieve any meaningful impact. [@thomaesGreenTeensUnderstanding2023] reports U.S. adolescents don't find sustainability relevant to their daily life. [@rossClimateChangeChallenge2016] says most people in the U.S. don't act on climate change. "Action on climate change has been compromised by uncertainty, aspects of human psychology". -

[@creditsuisseYoungConsumersMay2022] suggests young consumers are more eco-friendly and drive the speed of change. Yet the Economist has ran a few anonymous articles calling gen-z green ideals into question [@theeconomistHowSellYoung2023; @HowGenMillennials2023]. - [@woodGenCaresSustainability2022] suggests in the U.S. Gen-Z is willing to pay 10% more for ethically goods, spend 24% more on sustainable products than Generation X and 75% of Gen Z would prioritize sustainability over brand loyalty. Meanwhile Gen-Z in the U.S. are heavy users of online fashion shopping, Chinese cheap online store Shein overtakes Amazon as the most downloaded shopping app, while clothes resale apps such as Depop and ThredUp grow in popularity [@alexreiceMostEcoconsciousGeneration2021].

-   In Portugal, Estonia, and elsewhere young people are suing companies for eco-problems: @florIstoNaoAcaba2024

-   [@manchandaCultivatingSustainabilityConsciousness2023] survey (n=726) administered at shopping malls in New Delhi, India, found similar levels of sustainability consciousness between Millenial (n=206) and Generation-Z (n=360) age groups; people with high level of materialism were found to be less sustainability-conscious; the effect of mindfulness on sustainability was found to be stronger among females than males, supporting the hypothesis of the moderating effect of gender.

## The Experience of Climate Change and Pollution Levels in Taiwan

Taiwan has been affected by drought over 4 decades, rising temperatures and altered rainfall patterns, impacting water security and semiconductor manufacturing​[@voFourdecadeSpringDroughts2024]. Corals surrounding Taiwan are affected by marine heatwaves, ocean acidification and increased sea surface temperature affects coral bleaching level [@hsuInvestigationKuroshiocoastalCurrent2024]. Biomarkers in the sediment core around Taiwan are being used to study variations in climate over past thousands of years [@wangPaleoproductivityClimateEvolution2021]. Taiwan is affected by Kuroshio (黑潮) like Estonia is affected by the Gulf Stream. Both oceanic currents help regulate the climates of their respective regions and marine ecosystems. Kuroshio is a warm current of the Pacific Ocean. Rossby planetary waves driven by the Earth's rotation are crucial to keeping the atmosphere in balance by helping transfer tropical heat towards Earth's poles and cold air toward the tropics; interactions between oceanic currents, Rossby waves and nonlinear *mesoscale eddies,* which form complex undulations, and their effect on the climate are still not well understood [@usdepartmentofcommerceWhatRossbyWave; @belonenkoInteractionRossbyWaves2023; @liuNinoSouthernOscillationEast2024; @linSatelliteObservedNew2022; @yinSeasonalityKuroshioIntensity2019; @mensahEvolutionKuroshioTropical2014; @shenLongtermVariabilityKuroshio2014]. Around 33% of Taiwanese CO2e emissions is captured by the marine carbon sink, while the effect of forests in Taiwan needs further study [@hungAssessingCO2Sources2024].

Taiwanese college students are subjected to high levels of pollution. University campuses are somewhat healthier than other areas. There are several decades of research on pollution levels in Taiwan, most with very scary correlations to health.

-   Taiwan air pollution, the worst (highest PM2.5 concentration) were found in Changhua (24.5 µg/m³), Tainan (20.9 µg/m³), and Pingtong (20.7 µg/m³) [@changhsiung-fengTaiwanAir45th2024].

-   There have been concerns about food safety in Taiwan.

-   When disaster hits we need high levels of *social trust*. being part of community of trust makes it easier to act in unison. Religion is a type of community of trust. conversely, that can also have negative effects, as in Taiwan the expected behaviour of burning joss sticks and paper money, is a cause of air pollution [@tangRitualBurningThreatens2014]

### Climate Anxiety

A growing body of research shows climate anxiety is widespread among young people, which emotionally can both hinder and motivate sustainable action.

A large worldwide study in (n=10000, age 16-25) by [@hickmanClimateAnxietyChildren2021] provides evidence the youth is anxious about climate in 10 countries: Australia, Brazil, Finland, France, India, Nigeria, Philippines, Portugal, the UK, and the USA. Similarly, [@thompsonYoungPeopleClimate2021] finds young people around the world have climate anxiety. [@whitmarshClimateAnxietyWhat2022] shows worry about the climate in the UK is generally widespread (over 40% of the respondents, n=1332), while climate anxiety is highest among young people and is a possible motivator for climate action. Additionally, [@ogunbodeClimateAnxietyWellbeing2022] finds climate anxiety in 32 countries and also supports the idea that climate anxiety leads to climate activism. [@thibodeauThreeCompaniesClosing2022]: "In 2021, the BBC polled 1,000 people in Scotland to understand the barriers to taking climate action. What they found was even though many people were aware of actions needed to take to address climate change, and had intentions to their behaviors didn't change. This is a phenomenon called the intention-action gap."

[@osakaWhyClimateDoomers2023] argues *doomerism* is an excuse for climate in-action. Hope is necessary for people to make changes in their habits [@marlonHowHopeDoubt2019].

A recent special issue of Behavioral Sciences magazine on Behavioral Science for Climate Change (2025) provides further evidence. A review of 50 studies supports the idea that climate activism shifts public opinion towards climate concern [@thomas-waltersImpactsClimateActivism2025]. Climate change negative affect braing health through heat, air pollution, extreme weather; the study finds links to neurological, psychiatric, and cognitive disorders [@todorovaNeuroscienceClimateAction2025].

-   Designing for Health and Sustainability: Health and sustainability are intrinsically connected. [@kjaergardHealthSustainability2014] shows how "understanding health and sustainability as a duality, health both creates conditions and is conditioned by sustainability, understood as economic, social and environmental sustainability, while on the other hand sustainability creates and is conditioned by human health"

-   Design for Human Rights [@unfcccSharmElSheikhImplementation2023] text refers to "human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment".

## The Attitude-Behavior Gap

While people express eco-conscious ideas, it's non-trivial to practice sustainability in daily life. Translating eco-conscious attitudes into concrete sustainable actions remains challenging. Empirical evidence illustrates this gap between intention and behavior. [@parkExploringAttitudeBehavior2020] positive attitude towards sustainable products does not result in purchase decisions, shows research of fashion in South Korea. In one Australian study, green consumers still waste food similarly to the baseline [@mccarthyFoodWasteGreen2017].

However, changing habits is important if techonology alone is not the solution. [@deyangeorgievGenStatisticsWhat2023] reports only 30% of people in the Gen-Z age group believe technology can resolve all environmental problems. Even with good intentions, [@munroSustainableAttitudebehaviorGap2023] finds shoppers who try to shop sustainably often fail to find sustainable product, in a systemic literature review of 64 papers from South Korea, Australia, the UK, the US, and elsewhere.

McKinsey says people want eco-products but aren't willing to pay more.

Willingness to pay research.

## Sustainability Tools in the Taiwanese Context, Digital Sustainability: Taiwan's Digital Receipt System

Musical garbage truck are a success story of the environmental progress in Taiwan [@helendavidsonClassicalTrashHow2022]. Indeed, they are a *user interface innovation* and the main way how people in Taiwan interact with sustainability issues.

The popular narrative about Taiwan recounts the story of the economic and environmental transformation of the country. In the late 1980s during the heights of an economic boom Taiwan became famous as the Taiwanese Miracle (臺灣奇蹟) [@goldStateSocietyTaiwan1986; @tsaiExplainingTaiwanEconomic1999]. By the early 1990s another less flattering nickname appeared: "garbage island", for the piles of trash covering the streets and overflowing landfills [@rapidtransitionsallianceTaiwanTransitionGarbage2019; @ngoHowGettingRid2020]. In the two decades that followed, from 1998 to 2018, Taiwan made progress in municipal waste management, rising to the status of a world-leader in recycling (2nd *effective recycling rate* after Germany); in addition to an effective recycling system, the average waste amount generated per person by 700g (from 1140g to 400g) per day; nonetheless, industrial recycling rates were less stellar, standing at 80% in 2020 and there were unrealized opportunities in using industry 4.0 technologies, such as internet of things (IoT) sensors for better waste tracking [@wuSupportingCircularEconomy2021; @buiMunicipalSolidWaste2023].

Progress in sustainability is possible but achieving results takes time and innovation. [@rapidtransitionsallianceTaiwanTransitionGarbage2019] credits the Taiwanese Homemakers United Foundation (財團法人主婦聯盟環境保護基金會) for initiating the transformation in 1987, suggesting a small group of people can have an outsized impact on the whole country. Their activity didn't stop there and [@CaiTuanFaRenZhuFuLianMengHuanJingBaoHuJiJinHuiBenHuiJianJie2020] recounts a timeline of their achievements on their website until the present day.

@DuJiaGuanChaDianZiFaPiao2025 reports 54.03% of invoices in Taiwan are digital. Since 2021 digital receiptts are mandatory for all businesses. Taiwan's longstanding receipt lottery also hass specific prizes available only for digital receipts. @XingDongZhiFuJieHeYunDuanFaPiao2018

Several other countries, such as Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Sweden, Italy, Portugal, Brazil, Mexico, have comparable systems in use.

## Trends in Taiwanese Companies from Industry to Online Shopping

## Financial Literacy Among Taiwanese Youth and Worldwide

A recent nationwide study titled Youth Financial Health Basics (青少年財務健康基礎大調查) jointly conducted by the Taipei Fubon Bank and the Parent-Child Innovation Center (親子天下教育創新中心) between February 11 and March 9, 2025 found that over 65% of secondary schools incorporated financial-literacy courses into their curricula however 64% of Taiwanese youths (aged 15–18) exhibit low confidence and understanding of financial products and face significant fraud risk, with nearly 1/5 of the respondents encountering a scam in the past year [@LianHeXinWenWangTaiWan2025].

In a much older study, @i-chengyehDefaultCreditCard2009 analyzed usage data from 30,000 credit-card clients at an undisclosed major Taiwanese bank to predict next-month defaults, using 6 data-mining techniques including ANNs (AI Neural Networks) [@yehComparisonsDataMining2009]. Because of the age of the study there's no Gen-Z data. People aged 18-26 at the time would be Millenials or Gen-X by now. the data was donated by [@misc_default_of_credit_card_clients_350] and roughly 1 in 5 credit card clients (22.1%) of the dataset defaulted on their payment in the next month. Among the 9,618 clients aged 18–29 at the time of the study, 2,197 defaulted on their next‐month payment, yielding a default rate of 22.8%, slightly higher than the overall average. Meanwhile, among the 5,127 clients aged 18–26, 1,285 defaulted, yielding a rate of 25.1%, considerable higher than their older counterparts. Finally, among the 1,558 clients aged 18–23, 430 defaulted, a rate of 27.6%, pointing to a trend of younger people having higher default rates.

Internationally, there's evidence young people have money. In the United States, the combined annual consumer spending of Gen-Z and Millennials was over 2.5 Trillion USD in 2020 [@ypulseMillennialsGenTeens2020]. Over the decade from 2020 to 2030, in the U.S., UK, and Australia, Millennials are projected to inherit 30 trillion USD from their parents [@calastoneMillennialsInvestingDetailed2020]. There's also some evidence of investment interest, however there's large geographic variance. According to a [@calastoneMillennialsInvestingDetailed2020] study (n=3000) surveying people in the millennial age group between ages 23 and 35 in Europe (UK, France, Germany), U.S.A., Hong Kong, and Australia, 48% of respondents located in Hong Kong owned financial securities (such as stocks) while the figure was just 10% in France.
