# Design for Sustainability

## What is Sustainability?
_Sustainability_ was first mentioned in 1713 by *Hans Carl von Carlowitz* in the context of forestry in his seminal book (@hannsscarlvoncarlowitzSylviculturaOeconomicaOder1713) discussing sustainable forest management, today known as *sustainable yield* of *natural capital* required to maintain *ecosystem services* (@peterkareivaNaturalCapitalTheory2011). Contemporary studies have shown *biodiversity* as one key factor to maintain delivery of ecosystem services (@leprovostSupplyMultipleEcosystem2022).

**_Designing for Sustainability_** encompasses all human activites, making a **_design for sustainability_** an over-arching challenge across all industries.

"Global CO2 emissions from energy combustion and industrial processes1 rebounded in 2021 to reach their highest ever annual level. A 6% increase from 2020 pushed emissions to 36.3 gigatonnes (Gt" (@ieaGlobalEnergyReview2022)

Growing public understanding of how nature works and intersects with our use of money.

## Population
In November 2022, Planet Earth's population reached 8 Billion people (@theeconomictimesClimateChangeEarth)

Projections show 9 Billion by 2050


## Overconsumption
Overconsumption is one of the root causes of climate change and marine plastic pollution. @FORD2022150392 suggest linkage of climate change and marine plastic pollution "along with other stressors that threaten the resilience of species and habitats sensitive to both climate change and plastic pollution".


## Fossil Fuels and Energy

There's evidence from several countries suggesting moving to renewal energy brings benefits:

- @AMIN2022113224 suggests "removing fossil fuel subsidies and intra-sectoral electricity price distortions coupled with carbon taxes provides the highest benefits" for both the economy and the environment in Bangladesh.

## Carbon Labelling
CO2 label for consumer products have been proposed for a long time (@adamcornerWhyWeNeed2012). While academic literature has looked at minute detail such as color and positioning of the label (@zhouCarbonLabelsHorizontal2019) and there is some indication consumers are willing to pay a small premium for low-CO2 products (@xuLowcarbonEconomyCarbon2022), the idea is yet to find mainstream adoption. Although labeling low CO2 food enables people to choose a _climatarian diet_, their impact on the market share of low-carbon meals is negible  (@lohmannCarbonFootprintLabels2022).

## Sustainable Finance
UNEP has identified that if the world is to meet its climate change, biodiversity, and land degradation targets, it needs to close a $4.1 trillion financing gap in nature by 2050. The stakes are higher than ever, biodiversity and nature must be at the forefront of the COP27 climate agenda. 
https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/unep-and-green-finance-institute-partner-podcast-series-nature-ahead

“We can and must channel private capital into nature-based solutions. This will require policy and regulatory support, catalytic capital and financial innovation. Ahead of COP27 in Egypt, Financing Nature: COP27 Special will showcase examples of where this is already happening, and discuss what we collectively must do to mobilise capital at scale” said Dr Rhian-Mari Thomas, Chief Executive Officer, GFI.
https://www.greenfinanceinstitute.co.uk/

## Carbon Markets
“The Emissions Gap Report (EGR) 2021: The Heat Is On shows that new national climate pledges combined with other mitigation measures put the world on track for a global temperature rise of 2.7°C by the end of the century. That is well above the goals of the Paris climate agreement and would lead to catastrophic changes in the Earth’s climate. To keep global warming below 1.5°C this century, the aspirational goal of the Paris Agreement, the world needs to halve annual greenhouse gas emissions in the next eight years. @

If implemented effectively, net-zero emissions pledges could limit warming to 2.2°C, closer to the well-below 2°C goal of the Paris Agreement. However, many national climate plans delay action until after 2030. The reduction of methane emissions from the fossil fuel, waste and agriculture sectors could help close the emissions gap and reduce warming in the short term, the report finds.

Carbon markets could also help slash emissions. But that would only happen if rules are clearly defined and target actual reductions in emissions, while being supported by arrangements to track progress and provide transparency.

## Supply Chains

Several startups are using distributed ledgers (blockchains) to track source material to the factories ad product movements from factories to markets. While blockchains enable securely tracing data, which is immutablet (no possible to change the same record, only update data in new records), the system still relies on correct data input. As the saying goes, "garbage in, garbage out". Indeed, the blockchain is most useful for auditing, as the time and place of data input can be guaranteed, it will be easier to conduct a search on who inpputted incorrect data.

The blockchain supply chain companies as of October 2022 include:


| №   | Company                                                                       | Link                                     |

Another aspect of supply tracing is the treatment of workers and working conditions. Companies that intend to 2give supply chain a voice" by connecting workers directly to the consumer (even in anonymously, to protect the workers from retribution), include *CTMFile* and *Alexandria*.

“But the real breakthrough is how we can surface that real-time ESG data directly to individuals in the shops and online, linked to the products that they are browsing and potentially buying. This means that ESG change will finally be driven by the ultimate judge of business success – the customer.”

## Social Objects
I'm interested in the concept of a "social object" https://medium.com/we-research-and-expriment-with-how-the-sharing/what-is-a-social-object-8dd52df0f15c and how the design can connect people to sustainable outcomes while shopping and investing. Perhaps even forming a community of sustainable action. What I showed in class looks like an app but it could also be a physical object (a speculative design). From the presentations I saw most students seemed to be interested in form and light (many lamps) and a couple were about medical uses. I don't remember seeing one that could be compatible with the environmental sustainabilty focus unfortunately...

## Interface Studies
Head of Product Design at Webflow (@davidhoangCreatingInterfaceStudies2022) suggests taking cues from art studies to _isolate the core problem_. "An art study is any action done with the intention of learning about the subject you want to draw". As a former art student, Hoang looks at an interface as _"a piece of design is an artwork with function"_.

Neri Oxman's expressions:
“ecology-indifferent”
“naturing”“mother naturing”
“design is a practice of letting go of all that is unneccesary”
“nature should be our single client”

speculative design
use imagination

- Societal movements change things: implication for design: build a community
- Processes sustain things: implication for design: built an app

## Experience Design
“People buy experiences, not technology.”

Loaning terminology from service design, the user journey within an app needs to consider about touchpoint on the way to a state of success. 

Mobile App Design
There's a number of user interface design patterns that have provide successful across a range of social media apps, copied from one to another, to the extent that the largest social media apps share a similar look and feature set.

Mobile-first
Provides a community for pooling money with like-minded investors
Social
Educational
Edutainment
Fun
Stories section like IG / app store
Common UI parts. Feed. Stories.  By using common UI parts from social media users have an easier time to accept the innovative parts. add Viz charts. Avatars are increasingly common and new generations are used to talking to computers. Karina from Korea(aespa, 2020). It makes sense your sustainability assistant would talk to you.

-- @WEE2021100364
-- @GUATH2022101821
-- @BERGER2022134716

## Conclusion

In unison, the technologies and practices reviwed above move us closer to enabling *realtime ESG*: up-do-date transparent information about how our product are produced. Realtime ESG is neccesarly a building block to enable consumers and investors make more accurate, real-world purchase decisions.
