## College Students

-   Targeted and gated to college students

-   FB, etc, Gas all had the same launch strategy - start with students

-   @americanpressinstituteKnowingNewsHow2022 finds that only 37% percent of U.S. Gen-Z and Millenials follow news related to environmental issues.

-   How:

    -   Ask how much time you want to contribute

    -   Match with other people based on time

    -   Create a group chatroom

    -   Use AI to help out with tips

    -   ask university what u study and match with that industry to become expert and sustainability leader in this field

    -   invest time not money, student don't have money

    -   consumer branded carbon credits like angry teenagers

    -   @kuzminskiEcologyMoneyDebt2015 ecology of money

### Climate Anxiety

@whitmarshClimateAnxietyWhat2022 shows climate anxiety is more prevalent among young people and is a possible motivator for climate action. @ogunbodeClimateAnxietyWellbeing2022 finds climate anxiety in 32 countries and also supports the idea that climate anxiety leads to climate activism. @hickmanClimateAnxietyChildren2021 provides evidence even children are anxious.

-   @thompsonYoungPeopleClimate2021 Young people have climate anxiety.

-   Designing for Health and Sustainability: Health and sustainability are intrinsically connected. @kjaergardHealthSustainability2014 shows how *"By understanding health and sustainability as a duality, health both creates conditions and is conditioned by sustainability, understood as economic, social and environmental sustainability, while on the other hand sustainability creates and is conditioned by human health."*

-   Finds that climate anxiety predicts joining climate action movements

-   Design for Human Rights @unfcccconferenceofthepartiesservingasthemeetingofthepartiestotheparisagreementcmaSharmElSheikhImplementation2022 text refers to "human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment".

-   Refi podcast: people need agency

***Design Implications:***

-   How to support the youth?

-   Design to reduce climate anxiety

-   Is getting people to go to nature more a good way to increase ecological awareness?

### Empowerement

Empowered by Design - The design should empower young people.

-   @rossClimateChangeChallenge2016 says most people in the US don't act on climate change. "Action on climate change has been compromised by uncertainty, aspects of human psychology".

-   @RooneyVargaClimateActionSimulation2019 shows the effectiveness of ***The Climate Action Simulation*** in educating users about success scenarios.

***Design Implications:***

-   Younger people show higher motivation (participants in climate protests). How to be relevant for a younger audience?

-   Yet action remains low.

-   The demographics that stand to win the most from the green transformation of business are the youngest generations, with more years of life ahead of them, and more exposure to future environmental and social risks. It would be advisable for Generation Z and their parents (Millennials) to invest their resources in greener assets, however, it's still difficult to pick and choose between 'good' and 'bad' financial vehicles to invest in.

-   This creates an opportunity for a new generation of sustainable investment apps, focusing on the usability and accessibility of ESG for a mainstream audience. Generation Z and Millennials expect a consumer-grade user experience.

-   What would that experience look like? I've chosen these demographics with the assumption that if given the right tools, the emotional demand for sustainability could be transformed into action. The exploration of systems of feedback to enable consumers to apply more direct positive and negative pressure to the businesses and consumers signal consequences for undesirable ecological performance is a major motivation of this study.

### Personas

-   Use personas to articulate assumptions

-   Persona: I care mostly about... fashion, art, ...

-   @dontlookupMethodology Don't look up five user models / roles Consumer, Investor, Activist, ..

### Community

-   People exist in relation to other people.

-   Psychology of 'fundraising clubs' vs individual investing

-   @UkraineDAOBiddingUkrainian Ukraine DAO

-   POAPs:

### Zero Waste Lifestyle and Minimalism

Young people like to follow trends.

The opposite of overconsumption is the zero waste lifestyle. A movement of people living a simple life. This is always going to be a small percentage of people.

-   @tokyosimpleecolifeWhatLearnedMy2021
-   @costaHowFinnishCulture2018: Finnish socialists: minimalism
-   Most college students are not zero waste or minimalist.

**Design Implications:** These social movements are small and require too much effort to be feasible for the app?

### Group Purchases

Zero waste suggests people buy in bulk to save

Food ordering apps are popular.

-   Buying in bulk for more savings.

-   Through group purchases and community investing while also reducing consumption.

-   People want to help and make a difference. Give people things to do.

-   Choose Your Climate Solutions

-   Find Your Composting Community

-   Monoculture -\> regenerative food forests Oil -\> electric cars / bicycles

### Mobile-First

Young people are mobile-first.

There's a number of user interface design patterns that have provide successful across a range of social media apps, copied from one to another, to the extent that the largest social media apps share a similar look and feature set.

-   Mobile-first

-   Provides a community for pooling money with like-minded investors

-   Social

-   Educational

-   Edutainment

-   Fun

-   Stories section like IG / app store

-   Common UI parts. Feed. Stories.Â By using common UI parts from social media users have an easier time to accept the innovative parts. add Viz charts. Avatars are increasingly common and new generations are used to talking to computers.

-   @hoangEnterDynamicIsland2022: "Dynamic interfaces might invoke a new design language for XR"

-   @aespaAespaEseupaMY2020: Karina from Korea. It makes sense your sustainability assistant would talk to you. Studies show gen N is speaking to computers all the time. Interacting with the user is on the rise. For example, Chime makes tipping suggestions on the place of purchase.

## **Intelligent Interfaces**

-   What is the role of an AI Designer? @lindenWhatRoleAI2021

-   @PeopleAIGuidebook

-   @LanguageModelSketchbook

-   @parundekarEssentialGuideCreating2021

#### Interaction Design

-   @kolkoThoughtsInteractionDesign2010 and @ixdfWhatInteractionDesign believe interaction design is still an emerging (and changing) field and there are many definitions. I prefer the simplest version: interaction design is about creating a conversation between the product and the user.

-   @weinschenk100ThingsEvery2011 says "People expect most online interactions to follow the same social rules as person-to-person interactions. It's a shortcut that your brain uses to quickly evaluate trustworthiness."

-   @richardyangInteractionDesignMore2021 and @justinbakerRedRoutesCritical2018 say some of the tools used by interaction designers include

-   Red Route Analysis?

-   AI for design: @AINextChapter2023

-   Interface Studies: @davidhoangCreatingInterfaceStudies2022, the head of product design at Webflow, suggests taking cues from art studies to ***isolate the core problem***. "An art study is any action done with the intention of learning about the subject you want to draw". As a former art student, Hoang looks at an interface as *"a piece of design is an artwork with function"*.

-   Social Objects: People need something to gather around and discuss. @sharing.labWhatSocialObject2015: I'm interested in the concept of a "social object".

-   How the design can connect people to sustainable outcomes while shopping and investing? Perhaps even forming a community of sustainable action. What I showed in class looks like an app but it could also be a physical object (a speculative design). From the presentations I saw most students seemed to be interested in form and light (many lamps) and a couple were about medical uses. I don't remember seeing one that could be compatible with the environmental sustainability focus unfortunately...

***Design Implications***

-   Your shopping products mostly come from Protector and Gamble (3x) and Nestle. These are large conglomerates with a massive CO2 footprint. See the index to find some alternatives.

#### Experience Design

-   In @michaelabrashInventingFuture2017 Meta Oculus AR Incubation GM Laura Fryer: "People buy experiences, not technology."
-   Loaning terminology from service design, the user journey within an app needs to consider each touchpoint on the way to a state of success.

#### Product Design

Young people expect a product.

-   @koningsHowPrepareYour2020
-   "Digital sustainability principles"
-   Eminent journal Design Studies, 1st design journal
-   @ceschinEvolutionDesignSustainability2016 shows how design for sustainability has expanded from a product focus to systems-thinking focus placing the product inside a societal context of use.
-   @CargoBikeFREITAG, Recycled clothing maker FREITAG offers sustainability-focused services such ass cargo bikes so you can transport your purchases and a network for *shopping without payment* = swapping your items with other members, as well as repairs of their products.

#### Design Systems

Create a design system to best to showcase my analytic skills

-   @ComprehensiveGuideDesign
-   @suarezDesignSystemsHandbook
-   @MethodPodcastEpisode
-   @AtomicDesignBrad

#### Data-Driven Design

-   Product marketers focus on the ***stickiness*** of the product, meaning low attrition, meaning people keep coming back.
-   What percent of all design is "sustainable design" ? Promoting sustainable design.
-   "Any community on the internet should be able to come together, with capital, and work towards any shared vision. That starts with empowering creators and artists to create and own the culture they're creating. In the long term this moves to internet communities taking on societal endeavors."
-   @joshluberTradingCardsAre2021 Trading cards are cool again
-   @jesseeinhornNewBalance6502020
-   @connieloizosMarcyVenturePartners2021
-   @natashamascarenhasQueenlyMarketplaceFormalwear2021
-   @jeffjohnrobertsDigitalArtAwaits2020

***Design Implications:***

-   Rebuilt the app as a personalized, narrative lifestyle feed.

#### Narrative Design

Bring together film school **storytelling** experience with design... Does branding also go here?

-   Older research on young adults by @katemoranDesigningYoungAdults2016 (Millenials at the time) highlights how Millenials "use Google as a reference point for ease of use and simplicity".

-   The rising availability of AI assistants however may displace Google search with a more conversational UX. Indeed, Google itself is working on smarter tools to displace their own main product, as exemplified by Google Assistant and large investments into LLMs.

#### Nudge & Gamification

-   The literature on *nudge* is huge, as researches try to find ways to affect human behaviors towards sustainability. Some notable examples:
-   @WEE2021100364 proposes 7 types of nudging technique based on an overview of 37 papers in the field.

| Name              | Technique                                                                                 |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Prompting         | Create cues and reminders to perform a certain behavior                                   |
| Sizing            | Decrease or increase the size of items or portions                                        |
| Proximity         | Change the physical (or temporal) distance of options                                     |
| Presentation      | Change the way items are displayed                                                        |
| Priming           | Expose users to certain stimuli before decision-making                                    |
| Labelling         | Provide labels to influence choice (for example CO2 footprint labels)                     |
| Functional Design | Design the environment and choice architecture so the desired behavior is more convenient |

-   Google and X have offered the "Green Filter" on Maps, Flights, etc. What if there was a "Green Filter" on every product everywhere?

```{=mdx}
<Figure caption="Google's view of flight emissions" src={FlightEmissions} refURL="https://www.google.com/travel/flights" refTitle="Copyright by Google 2023 referenced under fair use" />
```
-   One example of *nudge* are the small UI updates released by Google across its portfolio of products: Google Flights and Google maps. Google's research introduces the concept of *digital decarbonization*, which @implementconsultinggroupHowDigitalSector2022 defines as "Maximising the enabling role of digital technologies by accelerating already available digital solutions".
-   In @katebrandtGoogleClimateAction2022, Google's Chief Sustainability Officer Kate Brandt suggests "Digital solutions play an important enabling role for at least 20-25% of the reductions required to achieve a net-zero economy in Europe".
-   @mohitmoondraNavigateMoreSustainably: Google Maps AI suggests more eco-friendly driving routes
-   Google Flights suggests flights with lower CO2 emissions

| â   | Product        | Nudge                                |
|-----|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1   | Google Maps    | Show routes with lower CO2 emissions |
| 2   | Google Flights | Show CO2 emissions                   |

#### Platform Economy & Superapps

-   Superapps are possible **thanks to Nudge.**

-   @undheimEcoTechInvesting2024 Ecotech

-   The rise of the platform economy has given us marketplace companies like Airbnb and Uber that match idle resources with retail demand and optimize how our cities work. The massive amounts of data generated by these companies are used by smart cities to re-design their physical environments. With this perspective of scale, what would a shopping experience look like if one knew at the point of sale, which products are greener, and which are more environmentally polluting?

-   Young people are stuck inside platforms. You don't own the data you put on TikTok. You can't leave because you'll lose the audience.

-   Network Effects: The more people use a platform, the more valuable it becomes.

-   The most successful businesses today (as measured in terms of the number of users) look at the whole user experience. Popular consumer platforms strive to design solutions that feel personalized at every touchpoint on the user journey (to use the language of service design) but doing so at the scale of hundreds of millions (or even billions) of users - personalization at scale.

-   What would a sustainable investment platform that matches green investments with the consumers look like, if one saw the side-by-side comparison of investment vehicles on their ESG performance?

-   How to design superapps? Lots of options in a single app.

-   @WillEuropeGet2022

-   WeChat

-   Adaptive AI

-   @vecchiTwoTalesInternationalization2022 China is the home of many superapps and this paper discusses the strategies taken to expand to other markets.

-   @shabrinanurqamaraniEFFECTSMOBILESERVICE2020 discusses the system consistency and quality of South--East Asian superapps Gojek and Grab.

-   @zengThreeParadoxesBuilding2015 **(need to pay for article!)**

-   @huangRedomesticatingSocialMedia2021 **(need to pay for article!)**

-   @suarezEnhancingUserIncome2021 suggests using alternative data from super-apps to estimate user income levels, including 4 types of data: Personal Information, Consumption Patterns, Payment Information, and Financial services.

-   @roaSuperappBehavioralPatterns2021 finds super-app alternative data is especially useful for credit-scoring young, low-wealth individuals.

-   @giudice2020wechat MA thesis's argues WeChat has had a profound impact on changing China into a cashless society, underlining how one mobile app can transform social and financial interactions of an entire country.

#### Quantified Self & Wearables

Use technology to be more aware of one's health.

-   Figure 9: Popular Strava sports assistant provides run tracking and feedback. AI Financial Advisors will need to go further to motivate users. because of the nature of the technology, which is based on the quality of the data the systems ingest, they are prone to mistakes.

```{=mdx}
<Figure caption="Figure 9: Popular Strava sports assistant provides run tracking and feedback - AI Financial Advisors will need to go further to motivate users. " src={Strava} />
```
There is a lot of research on quantified self. the Wearable devices like Apple Watch, Oura Ring and apps help users track a variety of health metrics. Can we also track personal sustainability in a similar fashion?

-   There is a parallel in health to sustainability and indeed both are inextricably linked.

-   @appleEmpoweringPeopleLive2022: In a 2022 report Apple outlines its plans to : "Empowering people to live a healthier day"

-   @appleWhatNewHealthKit2022 What's new in HealthKit

-   @delclos-alioWalkingTransportationLarge2022 discusses walking in Latin American cities. Walking is the most sustainable method or transport but requires the availability of city infrastructure, such as sidewalks, which many cities still lack.

## Education

#### Guided Sustainability

Sustainability touches every facet of human existence and is thus an enormous undertaking. Making progress on sustainability is only possible if there's a large-scale coordinated effort by humans around the planet. For this to happen, some technological tools are required.

-   "Guided Sustainability refers to a concept of using technology, such as AI and machine learning, to help individuals and organizations make more sustainable decisions and take actions that promote environmental and social sustainability. This can include things like analyzing data on resource usage and emissions, providing recommendations for reducing the environmental impact of operations, or helping to identify and track progress towards sustainability goals. The goal of guided sustainability is to make it easier for people to understand their impact on the environment and to take steps to reduce that impact."
-   @sanchezGreenBearLoRaWANbased2022 LoRaWAN
-   There are many examples of combination of AI and human, also known as "human-in-the-loop", used for fields as diverse as training computer vision algorithms for self-driving cars @wuHumanintheLoopAIEnhancing2023 and detection of disinformation in social media posts: @bonet-joverSemiautomaticAnnotationMethodology2023. However @krugelAlgorithmsPartnersCrime2023 finds humans don't necessarily correct mistakes made by computers and may instead become "partners in crime".

: Examples of human-in-the-loop apps

***Design Implications:***

-   Guidance could help young people beat climate anxiety by taking meaningful action.

-   The app is just as much about helping people deal with climate anxiety as it's with solving the climate issue.

-   List of metrics that should be tracked to enable useful analytics. Ex: % of beach pollution, air pollution, water pollution (I had this idea while meditating). In essence, "green filter" is a central data repository not unlike "Apple Health for Sustainability".

-   Health and fitness category apps

-   Using "green filter" you can get a personalized sustainability plan and personal coach to become healthy and nature-friendly

### Imagination

It's important to be able to imagine a better future.

#### Speculative Design

-   The term *'speculative design'* was invented by @dunneSpeculativeEverythingDesign2013 in their seminal book as the question on the intersection of user experience design and speculation. Speculative design makes use of future scenarios to envision contexts and interactions in future use.

-   Phil Balagtas, founder of The Design Futures Initiative at McKinsey, discusses the value of building future scenarios at his talk at Google (@googledesignDesignSpeculativeFutures2019). One of his examples, the Apple Knowledge Navigator, from an Apple vision video in 1987, took two decades to materialize in the real world, inspired by a similar device first shown in a 1970s episode of Star Trek as a magic device (a term from participatory design), which then inspired subsequent consumer product development - and then another 2 decades, until the launch of the iPhone in 2007 - a total of 40 years!

-   @BARENDREGT2021374 explores the potential of speculative design to stimulate public engagement through thought experiments that spur public debate on an issue chosen by the designer.

***Design Implications:***

-   "Speculative Design" for a sustainability assistant

-   All green categories --- Green hub --- Ask the user to prioritize

-   In my "green filter" AI advisor app's scenario, the AI is scanning for opportunities matching the user's sustainable investment appetite and risk profile, using different methods of analysis, including alternative data sources. Traditionally, financial analysts only looked at traditional data, such as company reports, government reports, historic performance, etc., for preparing advisory guidance to their clients. With the advent of AI and big data analysis, many other options of research data have become available, for example, accurate weather predictions for agriculture can affect guidance, because of expected future weather disasters in the area. Other examples include policy predictions, pollution metrics, etc.

-   Professional financial advisors use automated tools to analyze data and present it in human form to clients. Today's ubiquitous mobile interfaces, however, provide the opportunity to 'cut out the middleman' and provide similar information to clients directly, at a lower cost and a wider scale, often without human intervention. Additional (more expensive) "human-judgment- as-a-service", a combination of robots + human input, can help provide further personalized advice for the consumer, still at a cheaper price than a dedicated human advisor. Everyone can have a financial advisor.
