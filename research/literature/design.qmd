## Young Adults

-   Targeted and gated to college students

-   FB, etc, Gas all had the same launch strategy - start with students

-   How:

    -   Ask how much time you want to contribute

    -   Match with other people based on time

    -   Create a group chatroom

    -   Use AI to help out with tips

### Climate Anxiety

@whitmarshClimateAnxietyWhat2022 shows climate anxiety is more prevalent among young people and is a possible motivator for climate action. @ogunbodeClimateAnxietyWellbeing2022 finds climate anxiety in 32 countries and also supports the idea that climate anxiety leads to climate activism. @hickmanClimateAnxietyChildren2021 provides evidence even children are anxious.

-   @thompsonYoungPeopleClimate2021 Young people have climate anxiety.

-   Designing for Health and Sustainability: Health and sustainability are intrinsically connected. @kjaergardHealthSustainability2014 shows how *"By understanding health and sustainability as a duality, health both creates conditions and is conditioned by sustainability, understood as economic, social and environmental sustainability, while on the other hand sustainability creates and is conditioned by human health."*

-   Finds that climate anxiety predicts joining climate action movements

-   Design for Human Rights @unfcccconferenceofthepartiesservingasthemeetingofthepartiestotheparisagreementcmaSharmElSheikhImplementation2022 text refers to "human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment".

***Design Implications:***

-   How to support the youth?

-   Design to reduce climate anxiety

-   Is getting people to go to nature more a good way to increase ecological awareness?

### Empowerement

Empowered by Design - The design should empower young people.

-   @rossClimateChangeChallenge2016 says most people in the US don't act on climate change. "Action on climate change has been compromised by uncertainty, aspects of human psychology".

-   @RooneyVargaClimateActionSimulation2019 shows the effectiveness of ***The Climate Action Simulation*** in educating users about success scenarios.

***Design Implications:***

-   Younger people show higher motivation (participants in climate protests). How to be relevant for a younger audience?

-   Yet action remains low.

## Service Design

-   @CargoBikeFREITAG, Recycled clothing maker FREITAG offers sustainability-focused services such ass cargo bikes so you can transport your purchases and a network for *shopping without payment* = swapping your items with other members, as well as repairs of their products.

***Design Implications***

-   Your shopping products mostly come from Protector and Gamble (3x) and Nestle. These are large conglomerates with a massive CO2 footprint. See the index to find some alternatives.

#### Experience Design

-   In @michaelabrashInventingFuture2017 Meta Oculus AR Incubation GM Laura Fryer: "People buy experiences, not technology."
-   Loaning terminology from service design, the user journey within an app needs to consider each touchpoint on the way to a state of success.

#### Interaction Design

-   @kolkoThoughtsInteractionDesign2010 and @ixdfWhatInteractionDesign believe interaction design is still an emerging (and changing) field and there are many definitions. I prefer the simplest version: interaction design is about creating a conversation between the product and the user.

-   @weinschenk100ThingsEvery2011 says "People expect most online interactions to follow the same social rules as person-to-person interactions. It's a shortcut that your brain uses to quickly evaluate trustworthiness."

-   @richardyangInteractionDesignMore2021 and @justinbakerRedRoutesCritical2018 say some of the tools used by interaction designers include

-   Red Route Analysis?

-   AI for design: @AINextChapter2023

-   Interface Studies: @davidhoangCreatingInterfaceStudies2022, the head of product design at Webflow, suggests taking cues from art studies to ***isolate the core problem***. "An art study is any action done with the intention of learning about the subject you want to draw". As a former art student, Hoang looks at an interface as *"a piece of design is an artwork with function"*.

#### Product Design

Young people expect a product.

-   @koningsHowPrepareYour2020
-   "Digital sustainability principles"
-   Eminent journal Design Studies, 1st design journal
-   @ceschinEvolutionDesignSustainability2016 shows how design for sustainability has expanded from a product focus to systems-thinking focus placing the product inside a societal context of use.

#### Design Systems

Create a design system to best to showcase my analytic skills

-   @ComprehensiveGuideDesign
-   @suarezDesignSystemsHandbook
-   @MethodPodcastEpisode
-   @AtomicDesignBrad

#### Data-Driven Design

-   Product marketers focus on the ***stickiness*** of the product, meaning low attrition, meaning people keep coming back.
-   Social Objects: People need something to gather around and discuss. @sharing.labWhatSocialObject2015: I'm interested in the concept of a "social object".
-   How the design can connect people to sustainable outcomes while shopping and investing? Perhaps even forming a community of sustainable action. What I showed in class looks like an app but it could also be a physical object (a speculative design). From the presentations I saw most students seemed to be interested in form and light (many lamps) and a couple were about medical uses. I don't remember seeing one that could be compatible with the environmental sustainability focus unfortunately...
-   What percent of all design is "sustainable design" ? Promoting sustainable design.
-   "Any community on the internet should be able to come together, with capital, and work towards any shared vision. That starts with empowering creators and artists to create and own the culture they're creating. In the long term this moves to internet communities taking on societal endeavors."
-   @joshluberTradingCardsAre2021 Trading cards are cool again
-   @jesseeinhornNewBalance6502020
-   @connieloizosMarcyVenturePartners2021
-   @natashamascarenhasQueenlyMarketplaceFormalwear2021
-   @jeffjohnrobertsDigitalArtAwaits2020

***Design Implications:***

-   Rebuilt the app as a personalized, narrative lifestyle feed.

#### Biodesign

-   Neri Oxman, biomaterials MIT media lab, 15. sept. 2020

-   Neri Oxman's expressions: "ecology-indifferent", "naturing", "mother naturing", "design is a practice of letting go of all that is unnecessary", "nature should be our single client".

-   Use imagination

-   Societal movements change things: implication for design: build a community

-   Processes sustain things: implication for design: built an app

#### Personas

-   Use personas to articulate assumptions

-   Persona: I care mostly about... fashion, art, ...

-   @dontlookupMethodology Don't look up five user models / roles Consumer, Investor, Activist, ..

#### Community

-   People exist in relation to other people.

-   Psychology of 'fundraising clubs' vs individual investing

-   @UkraineDAOBiddingUkrainian Ukraine DAO

-   POAPs:

#### Zero Waste Lifestyle and Minimalism

Young people like to follow trends.

The opposite of overconsumption is the zero waste lifestyle. A movement of people living a simple life. This is always going to be a small percentage of people.

-   @tokyosimpleecolifeWhatLearnedMy2021
-   @costaHowFinnishCulture2018: Finnish socialists: minimalism

**Design Implications:** These social movements are small and require too much effort to be feasible for the app?

#### Group Purchases

Zero waste suggests people buy in bulk to save

Food ordering apps are popular.

-   Buying in bulk for more savings.

-   Through group purchases and community investing while also reducing consumption.

-   People want to help and make a difference. Give people things to do.

-   Choose Your Climate Solutions

-   Find Your Composting Community

-   Monoculture -\> regenerative food forests Oil -\> electric cars / bicycles

#### Mobile

Young people are mobile-first.

There's a number of user interface design patterns that have provide successful across a range of social media apps, copied from one to another, to the extent that the largest social media apps share a similar look and feature set.

-   Mobile-first

-   Provides a community for pooling money with like-minded investors

-   Social

-   Educational

-   Edutainment

-   Fun

-   Stories section like IG / app store

-   Common UI parts. Feed. Stories.Â By using common UI parts from social media users have an easier time to accept the innovative parts. add Viz charts. Avatars are increasingly common and new generations are used to talking to computers.

-   @aespaAespaEseupaMY2020: Karina from Korea. It makes sense your sustainability assistant would talk to you. Studies show gen N is speaking to computers all the time. Interacting with the user is on the rise. For example, Chime makes tipping suggestions on the place of purchase.

#### Narrative Design

Bring together film school **storytelling** experience with design... Does branding also go here?

-   Older research on young adults by @katemoranDesigningYoungAdults2016 (Millenials at the time) highlights how Millenials "use Google as a reference point for ease of use and simplicity".

-   The rising availability of AI assistants however may displace Google search with a more conversational UX. Indeed, Google itself is working on smarter tools to displace their own main product, as exemplified by Google Assistant and large investments into LLMs.

#### Nudge

-   The literature on *nudge* is huge, as researches try to find ways to affect human behaviors towards sustainability. Some notable examples:
-   @WEE2021100364 proposes 7 types of nudging technique based on an overview of 37 papers in the field.

| Name              | Technique                                                                                 |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Prompting         | Create cues and reminders to perform a certain behavior                                   |
| Sizing            | Decrease or increase the size of items or portions                                        |
| Proximity         | Change the physical (or temporal) distance of options                                     |
| Presentation      | Change the way items are displayed                                                        |
| Priming           | Expose users to certain stimuli before decision-making                                    |
| Labelling         | Provide labels to influence choice (for example CO2 footprint labels)                     |
| Functional Design | Design the environment and choice architecture so the desired behavior is more convenient |

-   @BERGER2022134716 **(Need access!)**
-   Google and X have offered the "Green Filter" on Maps, Flights, etc. What if there was a "Green Filter" on every product everywhere?

```{=mdx}
<Figure caption="Google's view of flight emissions" src={FlightEmissions} refURL="https://www.google.com/travel/flights" refTitle="Copyright by Google 2023 referenced under fair use" />
```
-   One example of *nudge* are the small UI updates released by Google across its portfolio of products: Google Flights and Google maps. Google's research introduces the concept of *digital decarbonization*, which @implementconsultinggroupHowDigitalSector2022 defines as "Maximising the enabling role of digital technologies by accelerating already available digital solutions".
-   In @katebrandtGoogleClimateAction2022, Google's Chief Sustainability Officer Kate Brandt suggests "Digital solutions play an important enabling role for at least 20-25% of the reductions required to achieve a net-zero economy in Europe".

| â   | Product        | Nudge                                |
|-----|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1   | Google Maps    | Show routes with lower CO2 emissions |
| 2   | Google Flights | Show CO2 emissions                   |

-   Becoming a Sustainability-Aware App or Game.

-   @jenimilesBecomingSustainabilityAwareApp2022 suggests "GoogleÂ recently shared its goalÂ to help one billion people make more sustainable choices by embedding carbon emissions information into Google Flights and surfacing whether a hotel is Green Key or EarthCheck certified."

#### Platform Economy and Superapps

-   Superapps are possible **thanks to Nudge.**

-   The rise of the platform economy has given us marketplace companies like Airbnb and Uber that match idle resources with retail demand and optimize how our cities work. The massive amounts of data generated by these companies are used by smart cities to re-design their physical environments. With this perspective of scale, what would a shopping experience look like if one knew at the point of sale, which products are greener, and which are more environmentally polluting?

-   Young people are stuck inside platforms. You don't own the data you put on TikTok. You can't leave because you'll lose the audience.

-   Network Effects: The more people use a platform, the more valuable it becomes.

-   The most successful businesses today (as measured in terms of the number of users) look at the whole user experience. Popular consumer platforms strive to design solutions that feel personalized at every touchpoint on the user journey (to use the language of service design) but doing so at the scale of hundreds of millions (or even billions) of users - personalization at scale.

-   What would a sustainable investment platform that matches green investments with the consumers look like, if one saw the side-by-side comparison of investment vehicles on their ESG performance?

-   How to design superapps? Lots of options in a single app.

-   @WillEuropeGet2022

-   WeChat

-   Adaptive AI

-   @vecchiTwoTalesInternationalization2022 China is the home of many superapps and this paper discusses the strategies taken to expand to other markets.

-   @shabrinanurqamaraniEFFECTSMOBILESERVICE2020 discusses the system consistency and quality of South--East Asian superapps Gojek and Grab.

-   @huangRedomesticatingSocialMedia2021 **(need to pay for article!)**

-   @suarezEnhancingUserIncome2021 suggests using alternative data from super-apps to estimate user income levels, including 4 types of data: Personal Information, Consumption Patterns, Payment Information, and Financial services.

-   @roaSuperappBehavioralPatterns2021 finds super-app alternative data is especially useful for credit-scoring young, low-wealth individuals.

-   @giudice2020wechat MA thesis's argues WeChat has had a profound impact on changing China into a cashless society, underlining how one mobile app can transform social and financial interactions of an entire country.

#### Quantified Self and Wearables and Gamification

Use technology to be more aware of one's health.

There is a lot of research on quantified self. the Wearable devices like Apple Watch, Oura Ring and apps help users track a variety of health metrics. Can we also track personal sustainability in a similar fashion?

-   There is a parallel in health to sustainability and indeed both are inextricably linked.

-   @appleEmpoweringPeopleLive2022: In a 2022 report Apple outlines its plans to : "Empowering people to live a healthier day"

-   @appleWhatNewHealthKit2022 What's new in HealthKit

-   @delclos-alioWalkingTransportationLarge2022 discusses walking in Latin American cities. Walking is the most sustainable method or transport but requires the availability of city infrastructure, such as sidewalks, which many cities still lack.

-   @giannakosFitbitLearningCapturing2020 used wearable devices to measured physiological parameters of students at school to determine their learning efficiency.

#### Guided Sustainability

Sustainability touches every facet of human existence and is thus an enormous undertaking. Making progress on sustainability is only possible if there's a large-scale coordinated effort by humans around the planet. For this to happen, some technological tools are required.

-   "Guided Sustainability refers to a concept of using technology, such as AI and machine learning, to help individuals and organizations make more sustainable decisions and take actions that promote environmental and social sustainability. This can include things like analyzing data on resource usage and emissions, providing recommendations for reducing the environmental impact of operations, or helping to identify and track progress towards sustainability goals. The goal of guided sustainability is to make it easier for people to understand their impact on the environment and to take steps to reduce that impact."
-   @sanchezGreenBearLoRaWANbased2022 LoRaWAN
-   There are many examples of combination of AI and human, also known as "human-in-the-loop", used for fields as diverse as training computer vision algorithms for self-driving cars @wuHumanintheLoopAIEnhancing2023 and detection of disinformation in social media posts: @bonet-joverSemiautomaticAnnotationMethodology2023. However @krugelAlgorithmsPartnersCrime2023 finds humans don't necessarily correct mistakes made by computers and may instead become "partners in crime".

: Examples of human-in-the-loop apps

***Design Implications:***

-   Guidance could help young people beat climate anxiety by taking meaningful action.

-   The app is just as much about helping people deal with climate anxiety as it's with solving the climate issue.

-   List of metrics that should be tracked to enable useful analytics. Ex: % of beach pollution, air pollution, water pollution (I had this idea while meditating). In essence, "green filter" is a central data repository not unlike "Apple Health for Sustainability".

-   Health and fitness category apps

-   Using "green filter" you can get a personalized sustainability plan and personal coach to become healthy and nature-friendly

#### Speculative Design

-   The term *'speculative design'* was invented by @dunneSpeculativeEverythingDesign2013 in their seminal book as the question on the intersection of user experience design and speculation. Speculative design makes use of future scenarios to envision contexts and interactions in future use.

-   Phil Balagtas, founder of The Design Futures Initiative at McKinsey, discusses the value of building future scenarios at his talk at Google (@googledesignDesignSpeculativeFutures2019). One of his examples, the Apple Knowledge Navigator, from an Apple vision video in 1987, took two decades to materialize in the real world, inspired by a similar device first shown in a 1970s episode of Star Trek as a magic device (a term from participatory design), which then inspired subsequent consumer product development - and then another 2 decades, until the launch of the iPhone in 2007 - a total of 40 years!

-   @BARENDREGT2021374 explores the potential of speculative design to stimulate public engagement through thought experiments that spur public debate on an issue chosen by the designer.

***Design Implications:***

-   "Speculative Design" for a sustainability assistant

-   All green categories --- Green hub --- Ask the user to prioritize

-   In my "green filter" AI advisor app's scenario, the AI is scanning for opportunities matching the user's sustainable investment appetite and risk profile, using different methods of analysis, including alternative data sources. Traditionally, financial analysts only looked at traditional data, such as company reports, government reports, historic performance, etc., for preparing advisory guidance to their clients. With the advent of AI and big data analysis, many other options of research data have become available, for example, accurate weather predictions for agriculture can affect guidance, because of expected future weather disasters in the area. Other examples include policy predictions, pollution metrics, etc.

-   Professional financial advisors use automated tools to analyze data and present it in human form to clients. Today's ubiquitous mobile interfaces, however, provide the opportunity to 'cut out the middleman' and provide similar information to clients directly, at a lower cost and a wider scale, often without human intervention. Additional (more expensive) "human-judgment- as-a-service", a combination of robots + human input, can help provide further personalized advice for the consumer, still at a cheaper price than a dedicated human advisor. Everyone can have a financial advisor.

## Eco-Design

***Designing for Sustainability aka Circular Design or Eco-Design*** encompasses all human activities, making this pursuit an over-arching challenge across all industries also known as circular economy. Assuming that as individuals we want to act in a sustainable way, how exactly would be go about doing that?

-   "Evolution of design for sustainability: From product design to design for system innovations and transitions"

Circular economy is a tiny part of the world economy. @circleeconomyCircularityGapReport2022 reports only 8.6% of world economy is circular and *100B tonnes of virgin materials* are sourced every year.

-   @mcdonoughCradleCradleRemaking2002 book
-   @mcgintyHowBuildCircular2020: How to Build a Circular Economy
-   @dullCircularSupplyChain2021 book
-   @chapmanDesignEmotionalDurability2009 argues in his seminal paper (and later in his book) for ***"Emotionally Durable Design"***, the simple idea that we hold to things we value and thus they are sustainable. We don't throw away a necklace gifted to us by mom, indeed this object might be passed down for centuries. @roseEnchantedObjectsInnovation2015 has a similar idea, where ***"Enchanted Objects"*** become so interlinked with us, we're unlikely to throw them away.
-   Growing public understanding of how nature works and intersects with our use of money.
-   @hedbergCircularEconomyRole2021 argues digitization and data sharing is a requirement for building a circular economy.
-   @guptaAnalysisArtificialIntelligencebased2023 argues software is key to building more sustainable products, already for decades. More recently, companies like AutoDesk are putting CO2 calculations inside their design software.
-   @SustainabilityStartsDesign: "Sustainability starts in the design process, and AI can help".
-   @igeniusLetTalkSustainable2020
-   Very simple. "Carbon pricing is not there to punish people," says Lion Hirth @lionhirthLionHirthTwitter. "It's there to remind us, when we take travel, heating, consumption decisions that the true cost of fossil fuels comprises not only mining and processing, but also the damage done by the CO2 they release."

***Design Implications:***

-   AI can help us make sense of the vast amounts of sustainability data generated daily.

### Legislation

-   @europeanparliamentEcodesignSustainableProducts2022 proposal "On 30 March 2022, the European Commission put forward a proposal for a regulation establishing a general framework for setting eco-design requirements for sustainable products, repealing rules currently in force which concentrate on energy-related products only."

### Extended Producer Responsibility

One type of legislation that works?

-   @steenmansFosteringCircularEconomy2023 Argues for the need to engage companies through legislation and shift from waste-centered laws to product design regulations.

-   @pengExtendedProducerResponsibility2023 finds that the Carbon Disclosure Project has been a crucial tool to empower ERP in Chinese auto-producers.

-   @liuGlobalPerspectiveEwaste2023 reports, e--waste is growing 3%--5% every year, globally. @thukralExploratoryStudyProducer2023 identifies several barriers to e-waste management among producers including lack of awareness and infrastructure, attitudinal barriers, existing *informal* e-waste sector, and the need for an e-waste license.

-   In Europe, there's large variance between member states when in comes to textile recycling: while Estonia and France are the only EU countries where separate collection of textiles is required by law, in Estonia 100% of the textiles were burned in an incinerator in 2018 while in France textiles are covered by an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme leading to higher recovery rates (Ibid).

-   @christiansenExtendedProducerResponsibility2021: Nonetheless, EPR schemes do not guarantee circularity and may instead be designed around fees to finance waste management in linear economy models.

-   @jacquesvernierExtendedProducerResponsibility2021: French EPR scheme was upgraded in 2020 to become more circular.

-   In any case, strong consumer legislation (such as EPR) has a direct influence on producers' actions. For example, in @hktdcresearchFranceExpandsProducer2022\@, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council notified textile producers in July 2022 reminding factories to produce to French standards in order to be able enter the EU market.

***Design implications:** ERP and CDP data should be part of Green Filter.*

### Return, Repair, Reuse Schemes

-   There's a growing number of companies providing re-use of existing items.
-   @SmartSwap For example, Swap furniture in Estonia

Bring back your bottle and cup after use.

-   @pastorProposingIntegratedIndicator2023 proposes a **product repairability index (PRI)**
-   @formentiniDesignCircularDisassembly2023
-   Recycling [@lenovoFastTechUnsustainable2022] "rethinking product design and inspiring consumers to expect more from their devices"
-   "design is a tool to make complexity comprehensible" like the Helsinki chapel. there's either or a priest or a social worker. it's the perfect public service. "limit the barrier of entry for people to discover". elegant.
-   @zeynepfalayvonflittnerFalayTransitionDesign

### Packaging

Packaging is a rapidly growing industry which generates large amounts of waste @adaChallengesCircularFood2023. @bradleyLiteratureReviewAnalytical2023: "Over 161 million tonnes of plastic packaging is produced annually."

-   @ChallengesOpportunitiesSustainable2022
-   @ProteinBrandsConsumers2022
-   @DetailrichSustainablePackaging2010
-   @lernerHowCocaColaUndermines2019 Coca Cola plastic pollution

### Factories

-   Transparency about the polluting factories where the products come from.. the product journey

-   virtual factories

-   Tracing emissions from factory pipes... what's the app?

-   Factories should be local and make products that can be repaired.

-   Carbon-neutral factories "made in carbon-neutral factory" list of products

### Supply Chains

Circular design is possible if supply chains become circular.

-   @GreenDiceReinventingIdea2021

-   @arilehtKestlikkuseSuunanaitajadSaadavad2022 Recycle your phone, FoxWay and Circular economy for PCs

```
-   Several startups are using distributed ledgers (blockchains) to track source material to the factories ad product movements from factories to markets. While blockchains enable securely tracing data, which is immutable (no possible to change the same record, only update data in new records), the system still relies on correct data input. As the saying goes, "garbage in, garbage out". Indeed, the blockchain is most useful for auditing, as the time and place of data input can be guaranteed, it will be easier to conduct a search on who inputted incorrect data.

-   @vanwassenaerTokenizingCircularityAgrifood2023 Compares use cases for blockchains in enhancing traceability, transparency and cleaning up the supply chain. There are several technologies for tracking goods across the supply chain, from shipping to client delivery.

-   The blockchain supply chain companies as of summer 2023 include:

***Design Implications*****:** app shows traceability.

-   Ethereum blockchain and animal rights. "Blockchain can provide a transparent, immutable record of the provenance of products. This can be especially useful for verifying claims made about animal welfare. For example, products claiming to be"free-range," "organic," or "sustainably sourced" could have their entire lifecycle recorded on the blockchain, from birth to shelf, allowing consumers to verify these claims."

#### Oracles for Sustainability Data

Intersection with finance and Real World Data.

A data oracle is the concept of a source of real-world data which can be ingested through an application programming interface (API) by, for example, a blockchain system. There are many databases of sustainability information which could serve as an oracle for "green filter", including carbon labeling, packaging, transportation, consumption, and waste.

-   @ethereumOracles2023

-   @caldarelliOvercomingBlockchainOracle2020 notes it's a challenge to ensure the accuracy and trustworthiness of real-world data from Oracles.

-   @bradydaleChainlinkFounderSays2021 and @chainlinkNewReportBlockchains2022: The largest Oracle provider ChainLink founder Sergey Nazarov believes the collaboration of oracles and blockchains can make carbon credits more trustworthy.

***Design Implications*****:**

-   Make open data easy to use in everyday life.

-   The key idea is making CO2 Visible.

#### Carbon Labels

-   Adding CO2 labels for consumer products have been discussed for decades (@adamcornerWhyWeNeed2012). While academic literature has looked at even minute detail such as color and positioning of the label (@zhouCarbonLabelsHorizontal2019) and there is some indication consumers are willing to pay a small premium for low-CO2 products (@xuLowcarbonEconomyCarbon2022) as well as all else being equal, choose the option with a lower CO2 number (@carlssonSustainableFoodCan2022), the idea of *Carbon Labelling* is yet to find mainstream adoption. Although there's some evidence to suggest labeling low CO2 food enables people to choose a *climatarian diet* in a large-scale study @lohmannCarbonFootprintLabels2022 of UK university students, their impact on the market share of low-carbon meals is negligible.

-   @cohenPotentialRoleCarbon2012 argues carbon labels do influence consumer choice towards sustainability.

<!-- -->

-   @asioliConsumersValuationCultured2022 found differences between countries, where Spanish and British consumers chose meat products with *'No antibiotics ever'* over a *Carbon Trust* label, whereas French consumers chose CO2 labeled meat products.
-   Labels alone are not enough, as underlined by @edenbrandtConsumerPerceptionsAttitudes2022 in Sweden in a study which found a negative correlation between worrying about climate impact and interest in climate information on products, suggesting a need for wider environmental education programs.
-   @briankatemanCarbonLabelsAre2020: Carbon labeling is voluntary and practiced by only a handful of companies. The U.S. restaurant chain *Just Salad* , U.K.-based vegan meat-alternative *Quorn* and plant milk *Oatly* provide carbon labeling on their products. @climatepartnerLabellingCarbonFootprint2020: Companies like ClimatePartner and Carbon Calories offers labeling consumer goods with emission data as a service. @thecarbontrustHowReduceYour: The Carbon Trust reports it's certified 27 thousand product footprints.

-   @europeancommission.jointresearchcentre.CO2EmissionsAll2022 provides CO2 emissions for all the countries around the world, per total emissions the top 10 are China, U.S.A. the European Union, India, Russia, Japan, Iran, South Korea, Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia as of 2021.

#### Digital Product Passports

It's a further development of the idea of carbon labels.

-   @nissinenMakeCarbonFootprints2022 reports The European Commision has proposed a *Digital Product Passports* to help companies transfer environmental data. Carbon labels are needed for green transformation.

### Cases

-   There are many domain-specific research showing how varied industries can develop eco-designed products. For example, @DURIEZ2022454 shows how simply by reducing material weight it's possible to design more sustainable transportation.

**Design:** Conversations about sustainability are too general and one needs to look at the specific sustainability metrics at specific industries to be able to design for meaningful interaction.

#### Fashion

Sustainable Fashion, Textile Design

@YoungConsumersComplicated: Young people are the largest consumers of fast fashion.

Across industries, reports are saying there isn't enough transparency.

-   **Problem**: @emilychanWeStillDon2022 report says there's not enough transparency in fashion:

#### Food

-   [@santosCurrentTrendsTraceability2023]: complex supply chains make seafood (marine Bivalvia, mollusks) logistics prone to fraud, leading to financial losses and threats to consumer health. The same is true for cocoa beans, which are at risk from food fraud [@fanningLinkingCocoaQuality2023].
-   @nabipourafrouziComprehensiveReviewCarbon2023: "The agricultural sector contributes to approximately 13.5% of the total global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and accounts for 25% of the total CO2 emission."

There are several initiatives to reduce food waste by helping people consume food that would otherwise be throw away.
