## Human Patterns Enable Computers to Become AIs

There world is filled with structures. Nature, cultures, languages, human interactions, all form intricate patterns. Computer systems are becoming increasingly powerful in their ability to learn and copy these patterns into computer models. As of 2023, 97 zettabytes (and growing) of data was created in the world per year [@soundaryajayaramanHowBigBig2023]. Big data is a basic requirement for AI which enables accurately learning the structures of the world and reducing bias in its responses. Representations of the real world in digital models enable humans to ask questions about the real-world structures and to manipulate them to create synthetic experiments that may match the real world (if the model is accurate enough). This can be used for generating human-sounding language and realistic images, finding mechanisms for novel medicines as well as understanding the fundamental functioning of life on its deep physical and chemical level [@nopriorsInceptiveCEOJakob2023].

Ninety years ago @mccullochLogicalCalculusIdeas1943 proposed the first mathematical model of a neural network inspired by the human brain. Alan Turing's Test for Machine Intelligence followed in 1950. Turing's initial idea was to design a game of imitation to test human-computer interaction using text messages between a human and 2 other participants, one of which was a human, and the other - a computer. The question was, if the human was simultaneously speaking to another human and a machine, could the messages from the machine be clearly distinguished or would they resemble a human being so much, that the person asking questions would be deceived, unable to realize which one is the human and which one is the machine? [@turingCOMPUTINGMACHINERYINTELLIGENCE1950].

> Alan Turing: *"I believe that in about fifty years' time it will be possible to program computers, with a storage capacity of about 10^9^, to make them play the imitation game so well that an average interrogator will not have more than 70 percent chance of making the right identification after five minutes of questioning. ... I believe that at the end of the century the use of words and general educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted."* - from [@stanfordencyclopediaofphilosophyTuringTest2021]

By the 2010s AI models became capable enough to beat humans in games of Go and Chess, yet they did not yet pass the Turing test. AI use was limited to specific tasks. While over the years, the field of AI had seen a long process of incremental improvements, developing increasingly advanced models of decision-making, it took an ***increase in computing power*** and an approach called ***deep learning***, a variation of ***machine learning (1980s),*** largely modeled after the ***neural networks*** of the biological (human) brain, returning to the idea of ***biomimicry***, inspired by nature, building a machine to resemble the connections between neurons, but digitally, on layers much deeper than attempted before.

The nature-inspired approach was successful, and together with many other innovations, such as ***back-propagation***, ***transformers***, which allow tracking relationships in sequential data (for example sentences) [@vaswaniAttentionAllYou2017; @merrittWhatTransformerModel2022], Generative Adversarial Networks\*\*\* (GAN), (**ADD CITATION, 2016**), and ***Large Language Models (*****ADD CITATION*, 2018)***, led to increasingly generalized models, capable of more complex tasks, such as language generation. One of the leading scientists in this field of research, Geoffrey Hinton, had attempted back-propagation already in the 1980s and reminiscents how "the only reason neural networks didn't work in the 1980s was because we didn't have have enough data and we didn't have enough computing power" [@cbsmorningsFullInterviewGodfather2023].

By the 2020s, AI-based models became a mainstay in medical research, drug development, patient care [@LEITE20212515; @holzingerAILifeTrends2023], quickly finding potential vaccine candidates during the COVID19 pandemic [@ZAFAR2022249], self-driving vehicles, including cars, delivery robots, drones in the sea and air, as well as AI-based assistants. The existence of AI models has wide implications for all human activities from personal to professional. The founder of the largest chimp-maker NVIDIA calls upon all countries do develop their own AI-models which would encode their local knowledge, culture, and language to make sure these are accurately captured @worldgovernmentssummitConversationFounderNVIDIA2024.

OpenAI has researched a wide range of approaches towards artificial general intelligence (AGI), work which has led to advances in large language models[@ilyasutskeverIlyaSutskeverAI2018; @aifrontiersIlyaSutskeverAI2018]. In 2020 OpenAI released a LLM called GPT-3 trained on 570 GB of text @alextamkinHowLargeLanguage2021 which was adept in text-generation. @Singer2022MakeAVideoTG describes how collecting billions of images with descriptive data (for example the descriptive *alt* text which accompanies images on websites) enabled researchers to train AI models such as ***stable diffusion*** for image-generation based on human-language. These training make use of ***Deep Learning***, a layered approach to AI training, where increasing depth of the computer model captures minute details of the world. Much is still to be understood about how deep learning works; the fractal structure of deep learning can only be called mysterious [@sohl-dicksteinBoundaryNeuralNetwork2024].

Hinton likes to call AI an *idiot savant*: someone with exceptional aptitude yet serious mental disorder [@cbsmorningsFullInterviewGodfather2023]. Large AI models don't understand the world like humans do. Their responses are predictions based on their training data and complex statistics. Indeed, the comparison may be apt, as the AI field now offers jobs for *AI psychologists (ADD CITATION)*, whose role is to figure out what exactly is happening inside the 'AI brain'. Understading the insides of AI models trained of massive amounts of data is important because they are ***foundational***, enabling a holistic approach to learning, combining many disciplines using languages, instead of the reductionist way we as human think because of our limitations @capinstituteGettingRealArtificial2023.

Foundational AI models enable ***Generative AIs***, a class of AI models which are able to generate many types of ***tokens,*** such as text, speech, audio [@sanroman2023fromdi; @kreukAudioGenTextuallyGuided2022], music [@copetSimpleControllableMusic2023; @metaaiAudioCraftSimpleOnestop2023] and video, in any language it's trained on. Even complex structures such 3D models and even genomes are possible to generate. Generative AI is a revolution in human-AI interaction as AI models became increasingly capable of producing human-like content which is hard to separate from actual human creations. This power comes with ***increased need for responsibility***, drawing growing interest in fields like ***AI ethics*** and ***AI explainability.*** Generative has a potential for misuse, as humans are increasingly confused by what is computer-generated and what is human-created, unable to distinguish one from the other with certainty.

@nobleFifthIndustrialRevolution2022 proposes AI has reached a stage of development marking beginning of the ***5th industrial revolution***, a time of collaboration between humans and AI. Widespread **Internet of Things (IoT)** sensor networks that gather data analyzed by AI algorithms, integrates computing even deeper into the fabric of daily human existence. Several terms of different origin but considerable overlap describe this phenomenon, including ***Pervasive Computing (PC)*** (@rogersFourPhasesPervasive2022) and ***Ubiquitous Computing***. Similar concepts are ***Ambient Computing***, which focuses more on the invisibility of technology, fading into the background, without us, humans, even noticing it, and ***Calm Technology***, which highlights how technology respects humans and our limited attention spans, and doesn't call attention to itself. In all cases, AI is integral part of our everyday life, inside everything and everywhere. Today AI is not an academic concept but a mainstream reality, affecting our daily lives everywhere, even when we don't notice it.

## Responsible AI Seeks to Solve Generative AIs' Known Issues

Given the widespread use of AI and its increasing power of foundational models, it's important these systems are created in a safe and responsible manner. While there have been calls to pause the development of large AI experiments [@futureoflifeinstitutePauseGiantAI2023] so the world could catch up, this is unlikely to happen. There are several problems with the current generation of LLMs from OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Nvidia, and others.

| Problem                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Monolithicity              | LLMs are massive monolithic models requiring large amounts of computing power for training to offer ***multi-modal*** ***capabilities*** across diverse domains of knowledge, making training such models possible for very few companies. @liuPrismerVisionLanguageModel2023 proposes future AI models may instead consist of a number networked domain-specific models to increase efficiency and thus become more scalable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Opaqueness                 | LLMs are opaque, making it difficult to explain why a certain prediction was made by the AI model. One visible expression of this problem are ***hallucinations**,* the language models are able to generate text that is confident and eloquent yet entirely wrong. Jack Krawczyk, the product lead for Google's Bard (now renamed to Gemini): "Bard and ChatGPT are large language models, not knowledge models. They are great at generating human-sounding text, they are not good at ensuring their text is fact-based. Why do we think the big first application should be Search, which at its heart is about finding true information?" |
| Biases and Prejudices      | AI bias is well-documented and a hard problem to solve [@liangGPTDetectorsAre2023]. **Humans don't necessarily correct mistakes made by computers and may instead become "partners in crime"** [@krugelAlgorithmsPartnersCrime2023]. People are prone to bias and prejudice. It's a part of the human psyche. Human brains are limited and actively avoid learning to save energy. These same biases are likely to appear in LLM outputs as they are trained on human-produced content. Unless there is active work to try to counter and eliminate these biases from LLM output, they will appear frequently.                                  |
| Not Comprehensive          | LLMs have been pre-trained on massive amounts of public data, which gives them the ability for for reasoning and generating in a human-like way, yet they are missing specific private data, which needs to be ingested to augment LLMs ability to respond to questions on niche topics [@Liu_LlamaIndex_2022].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Lack of Proper Legislation | @anderljungFrontierAIRegulation2023 OpenAI proposes we need to proactively work on common standards and legislation to ensure AI safety. It's difficult to come up with clear legislation; the U.K. government organized the first AI safety summit in 2023 @browneBritainHostWorld2023.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Competition with Humans    | AIs outperform humans on creativity assessment tests [@mollickAutomatingCreativity2023; @haaseArtificialMusesGenerative2023]. Bots are even better than humans in solving CAPTCHA tests designed to distinguish humans from robots [@matthewsparkesBotsAreBetter2023]. AI AlphaGO 2 outperforms even the 85% of programmers in one competitive coding competition @googleUsingAISolve2023. Open AI founder Sam Altman is also a co-founder of WorldCoin, and blockchain-based startup which aims to give a unique identity to each human by scanning human eye retinas (something which computer don't have).                                   |

| Additional Issues          | @huyenOpenChallengesLLM2023 provides a long list of open problems in AI development; AI is still in very early stages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

: Some problems with contemporary AIs

### Moderating AIs

Currently algorithms are being moderated by humans. There are studies which show how low-paid workers used to moderate harmful content; terrible for mental health (ADD CITATION). Ironically, AIs could also be part of the solution to reduce such human–abusing work. @lilianwengUsingGPT4Content2023 shows how it's possible to use well-aligned AI moderate to harmful content.

### Human-in-The-Loop

-   Because AI responses are unreliable some percentage of the time, they require constant oversight (human-in-the-loop) @baileyAIEducation2023.

One approach to reduce the issues with AI is to introduce some function for human feedback and oversight to automated systems. Human involvement can take the form of interventions from the AI-developer themselves as well as from the end-users of the AI system.

There are many examples of combination of AI and human, also known as "human-in-the-loop", used for fields as diverse as training computer vision algorithms for self-driving cars and detection of disinformation in social media posts [@wuHumanintheLoopAIEnhancing2023; @bonet-joverSemiautomaticAnnotationMethodology2023].

: AI usage across fields

-   @cromptonDecisionpointdilemmaAnotherProblem2021 highlights AI as decision-support for humans while differentiating between ***intended*** and ***unintended*** influence on human decisions.
-   @chengInvestigationTrustAIenabled2022 describes AI-based support systems for collaboration and team-work.

### What Role Should The AI Take?

Literature delves into human-AI interactions on almost human-like level discussing what kind of roles can the AIs take. @seeberMachinesTeammatesResearch2020 proposes a future research agenda for regarding ***AI assistants as teammates*** rather than just tools and the implications of such mindset shift.

From Assistance to Collaboration

It's not only what role the AI takes but how that affects the human. As humans have ample experience relating to other humans and as such the approach towards an assistants vs a teammate will vary. One researcher in this field @karpusAlgorithmExploitationHumans2021 is concerned with humans treating AI badly and coins the term **"*algorithm exploitation"****.*

-   From assistant -\> teammate -\> companion -\> friend The best help for anxiety is a friend. AIs are able to assume different roles based on user requirements and usage context. This makes AI-generated content flexible and malleable.

Just as humans, AIs are continuously learning. @ramchurnTrustworthyHumanAIPartnerships2021 discusses positive feedback loops in continually learning AI systems which adapt to human needs.

### Conversational AI

-   People are used to search engines and it will take a little bit time to get familiar with talking to a computer in natural language @baileyAIEducation2023. NVIDIA founder Jensen Huang makes the idea exceedingly clear, saying "Everyone is a programmer. Now, you just have to say something to the computer." @leswingNvidiaRevealsNew2023

There are noticeable differences in the quality of the LLM output, which increases with model size. @levesqueWinograd2012 developed the *Winograd Schema Challenge*, looking to improve on the Turing test, by requiring the AI to display an understanding of language and context. The test consists of a story and a question, which has a different meaning as the context changes: "The trophy would not fit in the brown suitcase because it was too big" - what does the *it* refer to? Humans are able to understand this from context while a computer models would fail. Even GPT-3 still failed the test, but later LLMs have been able to solve this test correctly (90% accuracy) @kocijanDefeatWinogradSchema2022. This is to say AI is in constant development and improving it's ability to make sense of language.

***ChatGPT*** is the first ***user interface (UI)*** built on top of GPT-4 by OpenAI and is able to communicate in a human-like way - using first-person, making coherent sentences that sound plausible, and even - confident and convincing. @wangEconomicCaseGenerative2023 ChatGPT reached 1 million users in 5 days and 6 months after launch has 230 million monthly active users. While it was the first, competing offers from Google (Gemini), Anthrophic (Claude), Meta (Llama) and others quickly followed starting a race for best performance across specific tasks including standardised tests from math to science to general knowledge and reasoning abilities.

OpenAI provides AI-as-a-service through its ***application programming interfaces (APIs),*** allowing 3rd party developers to build custom UIs to serve the specific needs of their customer. For example Snapchat has created a ***virtual friend*** called "My AI" who lives inside the chat section of the Snapchat app and helps people write faster with predictive text completion and answering questions. The APIs make state-of-the-art AI models easy to use without needing much technical knowledge. Teams at AI-hackathons have produced interfaces for problems as diverse as humanitarian crises communication, briefing generation, code-completion, and many others. For instance, [@unleashSebastianAi2017] used BJ Fogg's ***tiny habits model*** to develop a sustainability-focused AI assistant at the Danish hackathon series Unleash, to encourage behavioral changes towards maintaining an aspirational lifestyle, nudged by a chatbot buddy.

ChatGPT makes it possible to ***evaluate AI models*** just by talking, i.e. having conversations with the machine and judging the output with some sort of structured content analysis tools. @oconnorOpenArtificialIntelligence2023 and @cahanConversationChatGPTRole2023 have conversations about science with AI. @pavlikCollaboratingChatGPTConsidering2023 and @brenta.andersWhyChatGPTSuch2022 report on AI in education. @kechtQuantifyingChatbotsAbility2023 suggests AI is even capable of learning business processes.

### Affective Computing and AI UX

Because of the conversational nature of LLMs, they are very useful for ***affective computing***, an approach to recognizing human emotions with machines and providing users experiences that take human emotion into account @picardAffectiveComputing1997.

-   @lvCutenessIrresistibleImpact2022 studies the effect of ***cuteness*** of AI apps on users and found high perceived cuteness correlated with higher willingness to use the apps, especially for emotional tasks.
-   @liuMachineGazeOnline2021 meanwhile suggests higher ***algorithmic transparency may inhibit anthropomorphism.*** People are less likely to attribute humanness to the AI if they understand how the system works.

Since the first mainframe computers with rudimentary computers able to respond with text messages, humans have been drawn to discussing their private lives with a machine that doesn't judge you like a human could. A famous anecdote is about the lab assistant of the Joseph Weizenbaum MIT ELIZA project in the mid-1960s, who would dedicate time to talking to the machine in private. The machine was called DOCTOR and emulated a Rogerian psychotherapist, developed by Carl Rogers, from the core idea that positive psychological functioning is a inherently human motivation [@bassettComputationalTherapeuticExploring2019].

Today's machines are much more capable so it's not a surprise humans would like to talk to them. One example is ***AI Friend*** is Replika, a computer model trained to be your companion in daily life. @jiangChatbotEmergencyExist2022 describes how Replika users in China using in 5 main ways, all of which rely on empathy.

| How humans express empathy towards an AI companion |

### Algorithmic Experience

As a user of social media, one may be accustomed to interacting with the feed algorithms that provide a personalized ***algorithmic experience***. Algorithms are more deterministic than AI, meaning they produce predictable output than AI models. Nonetheless, there are many reports about effects these algorithms have on human psychology **(CITE)**. Design is increasingly relevant to algorithms, and more specifically to algorithms that affect user experience and user interfaces. ***When the design is concerned with the ethical, environmental, socioeconomic, resource-saving, and participatory aspects of human-machine interactions and aims to affect technology in a more human direction, it can hope to create an experience designed for sustainability.***

@lorenzoDaisyGinsbergImagines2015 underlines the role of design beyond *designing* as a tool for envisioning; in her words, *"design can set agendas and not necessarily be in service, but be used to find ways to explore our world and how we want it to be"*. Practitioners of Participatory Design (PD) have for decades advocated for designers to become more activist through ***action research***. This means to influencing outcomes, not only being a passive observer of phenomena as a researcher, or only focusing on usability as a designer, without taking into account the wider context.

@shenoiParticipatoryDesignFuture2018 argues inviting domain expertise into the discussion while having a sustainable design process enables designers to design for experiences where they are not a domain expert; this applies to highly technical fields, such as medicine, education, governance, and in our case here - finance and sustainability -, while building respectful dialogue through participatory design. After many years of political outcry (CITE), social media platforms such Facebook and Twitter have begun to shed more light on how these algorithms work, in some cases releasing the source code (@nickcleggHowAIInfluences2023; @twitterTwitterRecommendationAlgorithm2023).

AI systems may make use of several algorithms within one larger model. It follows that AI Explainability requires ***Algorithmic Transparency**.*

The content on the platform can be more important than the interface. Applications with a similar UI depend on the community as well as the content and how the content is shown to the user.

### Guidelines

A Microsoft Co-Founder predicted in 1982 *"personal agents that help us get a variety of tasks"* [@billgatesBillGatesNext1982] and it was Microsoft that introduced the first widely available personal assistant in 1996, called Clippy. Found inside the Microsoft Word software. Clippy was among the first assistants to reach mainstream adoption, helping users not yet accustomed to working on a computer, to get their bearings [@tashkeunemanWeLoveHate2022]. Nonetheless, it was in many ways useless and intrusive, suggesting there was still little knowledge about UX and human-centered design. Might we try again?

With the advent of ChatGPT, the story of Clippy has new relevance as part of the history of AI Assistants. @benjamincassidyTwistedLifeClippy2022 and @abigailcainLifeDeathMicrosoft2017 illustrate beautifully the story of Clippy and @tashkeunemanWeLoveHate2022 ask poignantly: "We love to hate Clippy --- but what if Clippy was right?"

Many researchers have discussed the user experience (UX) of AI to provide ***usability guidelines***.

Microsoft provides guidelines for Human-AI interaction (@li2022assessing; @amershiGuidelinesHumanAIInteraction2019) which provides useful heuristics categorized by context and time.

| Context            | Time |
|--------------------|------|
| Initially          |      |
| During interaction |      |
| When wrong         |      |
| Over time          |      |

-   @baileyAIEducation2023 believes people will increasingly use AI capabilities through UIs that are specific to a task rather than generalist interfaces like ChatGPT.

How do the tenets of user experience (UX) apply to AI?

| UX         |
|------------|
| Useful     |
| Valuable   |
| Ussable    |
| Acceesible |
| Findable   |
| Desirable  |
| Credible   |

@guptaDesigningAIChatbot2023 proposes 3 simple goals for AI:

| 1                       | 2                    | 3                                            |
|--------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|
| Reduce the time to task | Make the task easier | Personalize the experience for an individual |

### Explainable AI

The problems of opaqueness creates the field of explainable AI.

"As humans we tend to fear what we don't understand" is a common sentiment which has been confirmed psychology [@allportNaturePrejudice1979]. Current AI-models are opaque '*black boxes'*, where it's difficult to pin-point exactly why a certain decision was made or how a certain expression was reached, not unlike inside the human brain. This line of thought leads me to the idea of ***AI psychologists,*** who might figure out the ***thought patterns*** inside the model. Research in AI-explainability (XAI in literature) is on the lookout for ways to create more ***transparency and credibility*** in AI systems, which could lead to building trust in AI systems and would form the foundations for ***AI acceptance***.

-   @tristangreeneConfusedReplikaAI2022: when the quality of AI responses becomes good enough, people begin to get confused.

@bowmanEightThingsKnow2023 says steering Large Language Models is unreliable; even experts don't fully understand the inner workings of the models. Work towards improving both ***AI steerability*** and ***AI alignment*** (doing what humans expect) is ongoing. @liangHolisticEvaluationLanguage2022 believes there's early evidence it's possible to assess the quality of LLM output transparently. @CABITZA2023118888 proposes a framework for quality criteria and explainability of AI-expressions. @khosraviExplainableArtificialIntelligence2022 proposes a framework for AI explainability, focused squarely on education. @holzingerMultimodalCausabilityGraph2021 highlights possible approaches to implementing transparency and explainability in AI models. While AI outperforms humans on many tasks, humans are experts in multi-modal thinking, bridging diverse fields.

-   The user experience (UX) of AI is a topic under active development by all the largest online platforms. The general public is familiar with the most famous AI helpers, ChatGPT, Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, Microsoft's Cortana, Google's Assistant, Alibaba's Genie, Xiaomi's Xiao Ai, and many others. For general, everyday tasks, such as asking factual questions, controlling home devices, playing media, making orders, and navigating the smart city.

-   @holbrookHumanCenteredMachineLearning2018: To reduce errors which only humans can detect, and provide a way to stop automation from going in the wrong direction, it's important to focus on making users feel in control of the technology.

-   @ZHANG2023107536 found humans are more likely to trust an AI teammate if they are not deceived by it's identity. It's better for collaboration to make it clear, one is talking to a machine. One step towards trust is the explainability of AI-systems.

### AI Acceptance

AI acceptance is incumbent on traits that are increasingly human-like and would make a human be acceptable: credibility, trustworthiness, reliability, dependability, integrity, character, etc.

RQ: Does AI acceptance increase with Affective Computing?

**AI is being use in high--Stakes Situations (Medical, Cars, Etc).**

AI-based systems are being implemented in medicine, where stakes are high raising the need for ethical considerations. Since CADUCEUS in the 1970s (in @kanzaAIScientificDiscovery2021), the first automated medical decision making system, medical AI now provides Health Diagnosic Symptoms and AI-assistants in medical imaging. @calistoBreastScreeningAIEvaluatingMedical2022 focuses on AI-human interactions in medical workflows and underscores the importance of output explainability. Medical professionals who were given AI results with an explanation trusted the results more. @leeAIRevolutionMedicine2023 imagines an AI revolution in medicine using GPT models, providing improved tools for decreasing the time and money spent on administrative paperwork while providing a support system for analyzing medical data.

### How Does AI Affect Human-Computer Interactions?

-   Intelligence may be besides the point as long as AI is becoming very good ad reasoning - AI is a ***reasoning engine*** [@shipperGPT4ReasoningEngine2023; @bubeckSparksArtificialGeneral2023; see @baileyAIEducation2023 for a summary].
-   @theinternationalergonomicsassociationHumanFactorsErgonomics2019: To provide a user experience (UX) that best fits human needs, designers think through every interaction of the user with a system, considering a set of metrics at each point. For example, the user's emotional needs, and their context of use. While software designers are not able to change the ergonomics of the device in use in a physical sense, which as a starting point, should be "optimized for human well-being".
-   @sarahperezCharacterAIA16zbacked2023 character AI, AI wife @MyWifeDead2023; mourning 'dead' AI @phoebearslanagic-wakefieldReplikaUsersMourn; AI for therapy @broderickPeopleAreUsing2023; bullying @sungParentsWorryTeens2023;
-   Software interaction design goes beyond the form-factor and accounts for human needs by using responsive design on the screen, aural feedback cues in sound design, and even more crucially, by showing the relevant content and the right time, making a profound difference to the experience, keeping the user engaged and returning for more.
-   @babichInteractionDesignVs2019 argues "\[T\]he moment of interaction is just a part of the journey that a user goes through when they interact with a product. User experience design accounts for all user-facing aspects of a product or system".
-   In narrative studies terminology, it's a heroic journey of the user to achieve their goals, by navigating through the interface until a success state. Storytelling has its part in interface design however designing for transparency is just as important, when we're dealing with the user's finances and sustainability data, which need to be communicated clearly and accurately, to build long-term trust in the service. For a sustainable investment service, getting to a state of success - or failure - may take years, and even longer. Given such long timeframes, how can the app provide support to the user's emotional and practical needs throughout the journey?
-   @tubikstudioUXDesignGlossary2018 argues affordance measures the clarity of the interface to take action in user experience design, rooted in human visual perception (), however, affected by knowledge of the world around us. A famous example is the door handle - by way of acculturation, most of us would immediately know how to use it - however, would that be the case for someone who saw a door handle for the first time? A similar situation is happening to the people born today.
-   Think of all the technologies they have not seen before - what will be the interface they feel the most comfortable with? For the vast majority of this study's target audience, social media is the primary interface through which they experience daily life. The widespread availability of mobile devices, cheap internet access, and AI-based optimizations for user retention, implemented by social media companies, means this is the baseline for young adult users' expectations in 2020 - and even more so for Generation Z teenagers, reaching adulthood in the next few years.
-   @shinUserExperienceWhat2020 argues interaction design is increasingly becoming dependent on AI. The user interface might remain the same in terms of architecture, but the content is improved, based on personalization and understanding the user at a deeper level. Shin proposes the model (fig. 10) of Algorithmic Experience (AX) "investigating the nature and processes through which users perceive and actualize the potential for algorithmic affordance".
-   That general observation applies to voice recognition, voice generation, natural language parsing, etc. Large consumer companies like McDonald's are in the process of replacing human staff with AI assistants in the drive-through, which can do a better job in providing a personal service than human clerks, for whom it would be impossible to remember the information of thousands of clients.
-   In @barrettMcDonaldAcquiresMachineLearning2019, in the words of Easterbrook, a previous CEO of McDonald's "How do you transition from mass marketing to mass personalization?". During the writing of this proposal, Google launched an improved natural language engine to better understand search queries (Google, 2020), which is the next step towards understanding human language semantics. The trend is clear, and different types of algorithms are already involved in many types of interaction design, however, we're still in the early stages. Where do we go from here?

### AI-Assisted Design - Tool vs Assistant?

Generative AI has enabled developers to create AI tools for several industries, including AI-driven website builders (@constandseHowAIdrivenWebsite2018), AI tools for web designers (@patrizia-slongoAIpoweredToolsWeb2020), Microsoft Designer allows generating UIs just based on a text prompt (@microsoftMicrosoftDesignerStunning2023), personalized bed-time stories for kids generated by AI (@bedtimestory.aiAIPoweredStory2023).

Tools do not call attention to themselves. They don't necessarily rely on human-like representations that call attention to themselves but rather are available in-context to help streamline specific tasks.

### AI Assistants in Media Portrayals

How AIs are represented in popular media shapes the way we think about AIs. Some stories have AIs both in positive and negative roles, such as Star Trek and Knight Rider. In some cases like Her and Ex Machina, the characters may be complex and ambivalent rather than fitting into a simple positive or negative box. In Isaac Asimov's books, the AIs (mostly in robot form) struggle with the 3 laws of robotics, raising thought-provoking questions.

There have been dozens of AI-characters in the movies, TV-series, games, and (comic) books. In most cases, they have a physical presence or a voice, so they could be visible for the viewers. Some include KITT (Knight Industries Two Thousand).

: AIs in different forms of media.

### Voice Assistants

**Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa** are well-known examples of AI technology in the world. Amazon's Rohit Prasad thinks it can do so much more, "Alexa is not just an AI assistant -- it's a trusted advisor and a companion."

-   LLMs combined with voice provide a unnerving user experience @ethanmollick2023
-   Ethical issues: Voice assistants need to continuously record human speech and process it in data centers in the cloud.
-   Siri, Cortana, Google Assistant, Alexa, Tencent Dingdang, Baidu Xiaodu, Alibaba AliGenie all rely on voice only.
-   @szczukaHowChildrenAcquire2022 provides guidelines for Voice AI and kids
-   @casperkesselsGuidelinesDesigningInCar2022: "Guidelines for Designing an In-Car Voice Assistant"
-   @casperkesselsVoiceInteractionSolution2022: "Is Voice Interaction a Solution to Driver Distraction?"
-   Companies like NeuralLink are building devices to build meaningful interactions from brain waves (EEG).
-   @tangSemanticReconstructionContinuous2022 reports new findings enable computers to reconstruct language from fMRI readings.
-   Focus on voice education?
-   @CELINO2020102410: There's research suggesting that voice UI accompanied by a *physical embodied system* is preffered by users in comparison with voice-only UI. This suggests adding an avatar to the AI design may be worthwhile.

There's evidence across disciplines about the usefulness of AI assistants:

-   @SERBAN20202849 suggests using the Alexa AI assistant in *education* during the pandemic, supported students and teachers 'human-like' presence. Standford research: "humans expect computers to be like humans or places"
-   @CELINO2020102410 found in testing chatbots for survey interfaces that "\[c\]onversational survey lead to an improved response data quality."

### AI Friends and Roleplay

Calling a machine a friend is a proposal bound to turn heads. But if we take a step back and think about how children have been playing with toys since before we have records of history. It's very common for children to imagine stories and characters in play - it's a way to develop one's imagination ***learn through roleplay***. A child might have toys with human names and an imaginary friend and it all seems very normal. Indeed, if a child doesn't like to play with toys, we might think something is wrong.

Likewise, inanimate objects with human form have had a role to play for adults too. Anthropomorphic paddle dolls have been found from Egyptian tombs dated 2000 years B.C. @PaddleDollMiddle2023: We don't know if these dolls were for religious purposes, for play, or for something else, yet their burial with the body underlines their importance.

Coming back closer to our own time, Barbie dolls are popular since their release in 1959 till today. Throughout the years, the doll would follow changing social norms, but retain in human figure. In the 1990s, a Tamagotchi is perhaps not a human-like friend but an animal-like friend, who can interact in limited ways.

How are conversational AIs different from dolls? They can respond coherently and perhaps that's the issue - they are too much like humans in their communication. We have crossed the ***Uncanny Valley*** (where the computer-generated is nearly human and thus unsettling) to a place where is really hard to tell a difference. And if that's the case, are we still playing?

Should the AI play a human, animal, or robot? Anthropomorphism can have its drawbacks. @pilacinskiRobotEyesDon2023 reports humans were less likely to collaborate with red-eyed robots.

The AI startups like Inworld and Character.AI have raised large rounds of funding to create characters, which can be plugged in into online worlds, and more importantly, remember key facts about the player, such as their likes and dislikes, to generate more natural-sounding dialogues @wiggersInworldGenerativeAI2023

-   @lenharoChatGPTGivesExtra2023 experimental study reports AI productivity gains, DALL-E and ChatGPT are qualitatively better than former automation systems.

**Human-like**

As AIs became more expressive and able to to **roleplay**, we can begin discussing some human-centric concepts and how people relate to other people. AI companions, AI partners, AI assistants, AI trainers - there's are many **roles** for the automated systems that help humans in many activities, powered by artificial intelligence models and algorithms.

-   RQ: Do college students prefer to talk to an Assistant, Friend, Companion, Coach, Trainer, or some other Role?

-   RQ: Are animal-like, human-like or machine-like AI companions more palatable to college students?

Humans (want to) see machines as human \[CITE\]

If we see the AI as being in human service. @davidjohnstonSmartAgentProtocol2023 proposes ***Smart Agents***, "general purpose AI that acts according to the goals of an individual human". AI agents can enable ***Intention Economy*** where one simply describes one's needs and a complex orchestration of services ensues, managed by the the AI, in order to fulfill human needs @searlsIntentionEconomyWhen2012. AI assistants provide help at scale with little to no human intervention in a variety of fields from finance to healthcare to logistics to customer support.

There is also the question of who takes responsibility for the actions take by the AI agent. "Organization research suggests that acting through human agents (i.e., the problem of indirect agency) can undermine ethical forecasting such that actors believe they are acting ethically, yet a) show less benevolence for the recipients of their power, b) receive less blame for ethical lapses, and c) anticipate less retribution for unethical behavior." @gratchPowerHarmAI2022

-   Anthropomorphism literature @liAnthropomorphismBringsUs2021 "high-anthropomorphism (vs. low-anthropomorphism) condition, participants had more positive attitudes toward the AI assistant, and the effect was mediated by psychological distance. Though several studies have demonstrated the effect of anthropomorphism, few have probed the underlying mechanism of anthropomorphism thoroughly"

**Animal-like: Some have an avatar, some not. I've created a framework for categorization. Human-like or not... etc**

**Machine-like**

The Oxford Internet Institute defines AI simply as ***"computer programming that learns and adapts"*** @googleAZAI2022. Google started using AI in 2001, when a simple machine learning model improved spelling mistakes while searching; now in 2023 most of Google's products are are based on AI @googleGooglePresentsAI2022. Throughout Google's services, AI is hidden and calls no attention itself. It's simply the complex system working behind the scenes to delivery a result in a barebones interface.

|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Voice Assistants | There are many distinct ways how an algorithm can communicate with a human. From a simple search box such as Google's to chatbots, voices, avatars, videos, to full physical manifestation, there are interfaces to make it easier for the human communicate with a machine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Sustainability   | While I'm supportive of the idea of using AI assistants to highlight more sustainable choices, I'm critical of the tendency of the above examples to shift full environmental responsibility to the consumer. Sustainability is a complex interaction, where the producers' conduct can be measured and businesses can bear responsibility for their processes, even if there's market demand for polluting products.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Sustainability   | Personal sustainability projects haven't so far achieved widespread adoption, making the endeavor to influence human behaviors towards sustainability with just an app - like its commonplace for health and sports activity trackers such as Strava (fig. 9) -, seem unlikely. Personal notifications and chat messages are not enough unless they provide the right motivation. Could visualizing a connection to a larger system, showing the impact of the eco-friendly actions taken by the user, provide a meaningful motivation to the user, and a strong signal to the businesses? |
| Machine Learning | All of the interfaces mentioned above make use of machine learning (ML), a tool in the AI programming paradigm for finding patterns in large sets of data, which enables making predictions useful in various contexts, including financial decisions. These software innovations enable new user experiences, providing an interactive experience through chat (chatbots), using voice generation (voice assistants), virtual avatars (adds a visual face to the robot).                                                                                                                  |
| Character Design | I'm a digital companion, a partner, an assistant. I'm a Replika." said Replika, a digital companion app via Github CO Pilot, another digital assistant for writing code, is also an example of how AI can be used to help us in our daily lives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Open Source      | For public discussion to be possible on how content is displayed, sorted, and hidden, algorithms need to be open source.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| User Experience  | User experience design (AI UX) plays a crucial role in improving the consumer to investing journey.
