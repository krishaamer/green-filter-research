## Definition

"AI is computer programming that learns and adapts" (@AZAI)

### From Concept to Reality
Since 1950 when Alan Turing published the Turing Test for Machine intelligence (@turingCOMPUTINGMACHINERYINTELLIGENCE1950) and Isaac Asimov proposed the 3 laws of Robotics, AI has come far, turning from a science-fiction concept into an everyday, mainstream reality. Especially in the last decade, AI-based solutions have become a mainstay in medical research, novel drug development, and patient care (@LEITE20212515), notably used for quickly finding potential COVID19 vaccines (@ZAFAR2022249), self-driving vehicles (passenger cars, delivery robots, drones in the sea and air, etc), and in many other industries, including AI-based assistants, which will be the focus here. This chapter will look at AI in general and then focus on AI assistants in particular.

Turing's test proposed a game of imitation: can the AI imitate a human so well that the person asking it questions would be deceived, when simultaneousely speaking to a real human and a computer AI, without realizing which is a machine.

> Alan Turing: _"I believe that in about fifty years’ time it will be possible to programme computers, with a storage capacity of about 10^9^, to make them play the imitation game so well that an average interrogator will not have more than 70 percent chance of making the right identification after five minutes of questioning. … I believe that at the end of the century the use of words and general educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted."_ -@stanfordencyclopediaofphilosophyTuringTest2021

Initially presented in a science fiction story, the 3 basic rules became an inspiration for AI ethics until today.

| №  | Asimov's Laws of Robotics  | 
| ----- | ------------------- | 
| 1st   | "A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm." | 
| 2nd   | "A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law." | 
| 3rd   | "A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law." | 

Google started using AI in 2001, when a simple machine learning model improved spelling mistakes when searching; now in 2022 most of Google's products are are based on AI (@googleGooglePresentsAI2022)

While by the 2010's AI became powerful enough to beat humans in games of Go and Chess, it did not yet pass the Turing test. Its use was limited to specific tasks and generalized models did not exist yet. This changed with increase in computing power and a new approach called _deep learning_, largerly modeled after the _neural networks_ of the biological (human) brain.

How to responsibly deploy AI for people around the world?

### The Advent of Large-Language Models (LLMs)
Since 2020, when OpenAI released the GPT-3 large-language model (LLM), trained on 570 GB of text (@alextamkinHowLargeLanguage2021), it's become possible to make AI-generated content that's difficult to distinguish from human expression, however it's still not passing the Turing test. @ZHANG2023107536 found humans are more likely to trust an AI teammate if they are not deceived by it's identity. It's better for collaboration to make it clear, one is talking to a machine. One step towards trust is the explainability of AI-systems. While current AIs are largely _'black boxes'_, which do not explain how they reach a certain expression @CABITZA2023118888 proposes a framework for quality criteria and explainability of AI-expressions.

| 8   | GLaM        |   2022    | Google        | 

The advances in the capabilities of large AI model mean we've reached a point, where it's possible to achieve UI and UX which previously was science fiction.

There's early evidence it's possible to assess the quality of LLM output in a transparent way (@liangHolisticEvaluationLanguage2022)

### Guidelines for Human-AI interaction
Microsoft's (MS) Co-Founder Bill Gates predicted in 1982 _“personal agents that help us get a variety of tasks"_ (@billgatesBillGatesNext1982) and it was MS that introduced the first widely available personal assistant inside Word software, called Clippy. Microsoft's Clippy was among the first assistants to reach mainstream adoption, helping users not yet accustomed to working on a computer (@tashkeunemanWeLoveHate2022). "We love to hate Clippy — but what if Clippy was right?" @tashkeunemanWeLoveHate2022. @abigailcainLifeDeathMicrosoft2017

Microsoft provides guidelines for Human-AI interaction (@li2022assessing; @amershi2019guidelines) which provides useful heuristics categorized by context and time

| №   | Context             |       |               |          
| --- | --------------------|-------|---------------| 
| 1   | Initially           |       |               | 
| 2   | During interaction  |       |               | 
| 3   | When wrong          |       |               | 
| 4   | Over time           |       |               | 

Likewise, Google's 7 AI Principles (@googleOurPrinciplesGoogle)

**Amazon Alexa** is the most well-known example of AI technology in the world. But Amazon’s Rohit Prasad thinks it can do so much more, “Alexa is not just an AI assistant – it’s a trusted advisor and a companion.”

### Voice Assistant Guidelines (Voice UI)
- Voice AI and kids @szczukaHowChildrenAcquire2022 

https://www.theturnsignalblog.com/blog/voice-design-guidelines/?ref=sidebar
https://www.theturnsignalblog.com/blog/voice-interaction/

Companies like NeuralLink are building devices to build meaningful interactions from braing waves (EEG). New findings enable computers to reconstruct language from fMRI readings (@tangSemanticReconstructionContinuous2022)

- Focus on voicend education?

Example Suggestions of the AI companion: 
- _"Don’t buy a car, use a car sharing service instead to save XYZ CO2. Service available near you: *Bolt*, *Uber*."_
- _"Use a refillable shampoo bottle to save XYZ plastic pollution"_
- _"Call your local politician to nudge them to improve bicycle paths and reduce cars in your neighborhood. Over the past 2 years, you city has experienced an increase of cars from 290 cars per capita to 350 cars per capita."_

Personal AI Assistants to date have we created by large tech companies. Siri, Cortana, Google Assistant, Alexa, Tencent Dingdang, Baidu Xiaodu, Alibaba AliGenie all relay on voice only. There's research suggesting that voice UI accompanied by a _physical embodied system_ is preffered by users in comparison with voice-only UI (@CELINO2020102410). This suggests adding an avatar to the AI design may be worthwhile.

There are many distinct ways how an algorithm can communicate with a human. From a simple search box such as Google's to chatbots, voices, avatars, videos, to full physical manifestation, there are interfaces to make it easier for the human communicate with a machine.

There's evidence across disciplines about the usefulness of AI assistants:

- @SERBAN20202849 suggests using the Alex AI assistant in _education_ during the pandemic, supported students and teachers ‘human-like’ presence. Standford research: “humans expect computers to be like humans or places”
- @CELINO2020102410 found in testing chatbots for survey interfaces that "[c]onversational survey lead to an improved response data quality."

## Personalized Artificial Intelligence (AI) Interaction Design (IxD)
User experience design plays a crucial role in improving the investing journey for Generation Z and identify the issue of out-of-date interaction design for Robo-Advisors in Europe. The missed opportunity to provide an even more interactive experience in line with expectations in the most successful AI advisory apps on the US market.

### Design for Sustainability and Participation
Designer Alexandra Daisy Ginsberg underlines the role of design beyond _designing_ as a tool for envisioning, in her words "design can set agendas and not necessarily be in service, but be used to find ways to explore our world and how we want it to be" (@lorenzoDaisyGinsbergImagines2015). Practitioners of Participatory Design (PD) have for decades advocated for designers to become more activist through action research, which means aiming to influence outcomes, not only be a passive observer of phenomena as a researcher or only focusing on usability as a designer without taking into account the wider context. Design is increasingly relevant to algorithms, and more specifically to algorithms that affect user experience and user interfaces. 

When the design is concerned with the ethical, environmental, socio-economic, resource-saving, and participatory aspects of human-machine interactions and aims to affect technology in a more human direction, it can hope to create an experience designed for sustainability. Inviting domain expertise into the discussion while having a sustainable design process enables designers to design for experiences where they are not a domain expert; this applies to highly technical fields, such as medicine, education, governance, and in our case here - finance and sustainability -, while building respectful dialogue through participatory design (@shenoiParticipatoryDesignFuture2018).

How do the 7 tenets of user experience (UX) apply to AI?

| №   | Company             | 
| --- | ------------------- | 
| 1   | Useful        | 
| 2   | Valubale        | 
| 3   | Ussable        | 
| 4   | Acceesible        | 
| 5   | Findable        | 
| 6   | Desirable        | 
| 7   | Credible        | 

### Interaction and Algorithmic Experience Design
To provide a user experience (UX) that best fits human needs, designers think through every interaction of the user with a system, considering a set of metrics at each point. For example, the user's emotional needs, and their context of use. While software designers are not able to change the ergonomics of the device in use in a physical sense, which as a starting point, should be "optimized for human well-being" (@theinternationalergonomicsassociationHumanFactorsErgonomics2019), software interaction design goes beyond the form-factor and accounts for human needs by using responsive design on the screen, aural feedback cues in sound design, and even more crucially, by showing the relevant content and the right time, making a profound difference to the experience, keeping the user engaged and returning for more. "[T]he moment of interaction is just a part of the journey that a user goes through when they interact with a product. User experience design accounts for all user-facing aspects of a product or system" (@babichInteractionDesignVs2019).

In narrative studies terminology, it's a heroic journey of the user to achieve their goals, by navigating through the interface until a success state. Storytelling has its part in interface design however designing for transparency is just as important, when we're dealing with the user's finances and sustainability data, which need to be communicated clearly and accurately, to build long-term trust in the service. For a sustainable investment service, getting to a state of success - or failure - may take years, and even longer. Given such long timeframes, how can the app provide support to the user's emotional and practical needs throughout the journey?

Affordance measures the clarity of the interface to take action in user experience design, rooted in human visual perception (@tubikstudioUXDesignGlossary2018), however, affected by knowledge of the world around us. A famous example is the door handle - by way of acculturation, most of us would immediately know how to use it - however, would that be the case for someone who saw a door handle for the first time? A similar situation is happening to the people born today. Think of all the technologies they have not seen before - what will be the interface they feel the most comfortable with? For the vast majority of this study's target audience (18-35, Sweden and Taiwan), social media is the primary interface through which they experience daily life. The widespread availability of mobile devices, cheap internet access, and AI-based optimizations for user retention, implemented by social media companies, means this is the baseline for young adult users' expectations in 2020 - and even more so for Generation Z teenagers, reaching adulthood in the next few years.

```{=mdx}
<Figure caption="Figure 10: Heuristic-Systematic Model of AI Credibility" src={AI} />
```

Interaction design is increasingly becoming dependent on AI. The user interface might remain the same in terms of architecture, but the content is improved, based on personalization and understanding the user at a deeper level. Shin proposes the model (fig. 10) of Algorithmic Experience (AX) "investigating the nature and processes through which users perceive and actualize the potential for algorithmic affordance" (@shinUserExperienceWhat2020). That general observation applies to voice recognition, voice generation, natural language parsing, etc. Large consumer companies like McDonald’s are in the process of replacing human staff with AI assistants in the drive-throughs, which can do a better job in providing a personal service than human clerks, for whom it would be impossible to remember the information of thousands of clients. 

In the words of Easterbrook, a previous CEO of McDonald's “How do you transition from mass marketing to mass personalization?" (@barrettMcDonaldAcquiresMachineLearning2019). During the writing of this proposal, Google launched an improved natural language engine to better understand search queries (Google, 2020), which is the next step towards understanding human language semantics. The trend is clear, and different types of algorithms are already involved in many types of interaction design, however, we're still in the early stages. Where do we go from here?

Lovejoy, lead UX designer at Google's people-centric AI systems department (PAIR), reminds us that while AI offers need tools, user experience design needs to remain human-centered - while AI can find patterns and offer suggestions, humans should always have the final say (@designportlandHumansHaveFinal2018).

### Platform Economy
The most successful businesses today (as measured in terms of the number of users) look at the whole user experience. Popular consumer platforms strive to design solutions that feel personalized at every touchpoint on the user journey (to use the language of service design) but doing so at the scale of hundreds of millions (or even billions) of users - persoalization at scale. The rise of the platform economy has given us marketplace companies like Airbnb and Uber that match idle resources with retail demand and optimize how our cities work. The massive amounts of data generated by these companies are used by smart cities to re-design their physical environments. With this perspective of scale, what would a shopping experience look like if one knew at the point of sale, which products are greener, and which are more environmentally polluting? What would a sustainable investment platform that matches green investments with the consumers look like, if one saw the side-by-side comparison of investment vehicles on their ESG performance?

## AI Credibility Heuristic: A Systematic Model

## What is Interaction Design?
Interaction design is still an emerging (and changing) field and there are many definitions. I prefer the simplest version: interaction design is about creating a conversation between the product and the user (@kolkoThoughtsInteractionDesign2010; @ixdfWhatInteractionDesign).

- “People expect most online interactions to follow the same social rules as person-to-person interactions. It's a shortcut that your brain uses to quickly evaluate trustworthiness.“ (@weinschenk100ThingsEvery2011)

Some of the tools used by interaction designers include (@richardyangInteractionDesignMore2021; @justinbakerRedRoutesCritical2018)
- Red Route Analysis

## What is Personalized AI?
AI IXD is about human-centered seamless design

- Storytelling
- Human-computer interaction (HCI) has a long storied history since the early days of computing when getting a copy machine to work required specialised skill. Xerox Sparc lab focused on early human factors work and inspired a the field of HCI to make computer more human-friendly.

Discuss what is UX for AI (per prof Liou’s comment), so it’s clear this is about UX for AI 

# Companions, Partners, Assistants
AI companions, AI partners, AI assistants, AI trainers - there's are many names for the automated systems that help humans in many activities, powered by artificial intelligence models and algorithms. AI assistants provide help at scale with little to no human intervention in a variety of fields from finance to healthcare to logistics to customer support. There's a saying in Estonian: "A good child has many names" "and it's true. I have many names, but I'm not a child. I'm a digital companion, a partner, an assistant. I'm a Replika." said Replika, a digital companion app via Github CO Pilot, another digital assistant for writing code, is also an example of how AI can be used to help us in our daily lives. The number of AI-powered assistants is too large to list here. I've chosen a few select examples in the table below.

## AI Acceptance
- "AI assistant advantages are important factors affecting the *utilitarian/hedonic* value perceived by users, which further influence user willingness to accept AI assistants. The relationships between AI assistant advantages and utilitarian and hedonic value are affected differently by social anxiety." @yuanSocialAnxietyModerator2022
- "Organization research suggests that acting through human agents (i.e., the problem of indirect agency) can undermine ethical forecasting such that actors believe they are acting ethically, yet a) show less benevolence for the recipients of their power, b) receive less blame for ethical lapses, and c) anticipate less retribution for unethical behavior." @gratchPowerHarmAI2022
- Anthropomorphism literature @liAnthropomorphismBringsUs2021 "high-anthropomorphism (vs. low-anthropomorphism) condition, participants had more positive attitudes toward the AI assistant, and the effect was mediated by psychological distance. Though several studies have demonstrated the effect of anthropomorphism, few have probed the underlying mechanism of anthropomorphism thoroughly"

## Young Adults
Most people in the US don't act on climate change (@rossClimateChangeChallenge2016a).

@RooneyVargaClimateActionSimulation2019 shows the effectiveness of **_The Climate Action Simulation_** in educating users about success scenarios.

Younger people show higher motivation (participants in climate protests). How to be relevant for a younger audience?

Yet action remains low.

*for young people, investing mostly means buying cryptocurrencies*

"Action on climate change has been compromised by uncertainty, aspects of human psychology" (@rossClimateChangeChallenge2016a)

### Storytelling and Narrative Design
Bring together film school experience with design...
Does branding also go here?

Older research on young adults (Millenials at the time) highlights how Millenials "use Google as a reference point for ease of use and simplicity" (@katemoranDesigningYoungAdults2016). The rising availability of AI assistants however may displace Google search with a more conversational UX. Indeed, Google itself is working on smarter tools to displace their own main product, as exemplified by Google Assistant and large investments into LLMs.
 
### Stickyness

### Community
- “Any community on the internet should be able to come together, with capital, and work towards any shared vision. That starts with empowering creators and artists to create and own the culture they’re creating. In the long term this moves to internet communities taking on societal endeavors.”

## Summary
The demographics that stand to win the most from the green transformation of business are the youngest generations, with more years of life ahead of them, and more exposure to future environmental and social risks. It would be advisable for Generation Z and their parents (Millennials) to invest their resources in greener assets, however, it’s still difficult to pick and choose between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ vehicles to invest in. This creates an opportunity for a new generation of sustainable investment apps, focusing on the usability and accessibility of ESG for a mainstream audience. Generation Z and Millennials expect a consumer-grade user experience. What would that experience look like? I’ve chosen these demographics with the assumption that if given the right tools, the emotional demand for sustainability could be transformed into action. The exploration of systems of feedback to enable consumers to apply more direct positive and negative pressure to the businesses and consumers signal consequences for undesirable ecological performance is a major motivation of this study.
