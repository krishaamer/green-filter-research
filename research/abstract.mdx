# Abstract

## The Journey from Consumer to Investor: Designing a Financial AI Companion for Young Adults to Help With Sustainable Shopping, Saving, and Investing

As of 2024, Earthâ€™s natural environment is being heavily degraded by the
companies that make the products and services we buy every day. The way
we use our money to interact with companies - through shopping as
consumers and saving / investing as investors - has an effect on the
life-supporting biosphere we rely on to make our planet inhabitable. In
essence, from an ecological perspective, every financial action is
either an investment decision to support more environmentally-friendly
companies - or to divest from sustainability. These profound
interconnections between our economic behaviors, ecosystem services such
as clean water, air, and soil, the climate crisis, and human health are
recognized by the emerging field of ***Planetary Health***.

College students in particular are concerned with climate change, yet
they are also busy with school and hindered by unavailability of simple
tools to make sustainable financial action convenient. Stronger
environmental policies from the European Union include the concept of
***digital product passports***, which hold the promise to help
distinguish ***eco-designed*** products made by ***circular economy***
companies which are truly trying to be zero-waste from companies that
simply say they are. Tracking product data from the source materials
until the consumer combined with ***data-driven interaction design***
enables us to build transparency into opaque systems. Likewise, advances
in the development of ***large-language models*** enable ***artificial
intelligence assistants*** to become a translation layer between complex
environmental data and human-comprehensible language.

Thisresearch is focused on leveraging ***design research*** to find
concepts for ***simpler*** ***AI user interfaces*** to help college
students begin the journey of participating in ***sustainable financial
activism***. A survey of 700 students across 10 universities in Taiwan
was conducted, enhanced by 5 expert interviews providing industry
insights. The major contribution of the study is an interactive
artefact: a prototype AI-assistant.
