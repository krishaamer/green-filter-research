## The Journey from Consumer to Investor: Designing a Financial AI Companion for Young Adults to Help With Sustainable Shopping, Saving, and Investing

The emerging field of *Planetary Health* recognizes profound
interconnections between our economic behaviors, ecosystem services
(water, air, soil), the climate crisis, and human health. In essence,
how we use money to interact with companies - through shopping, or
saving and investing - impacts the life-supporting biosphere we depend
on. From an ecological perspective, every financial action is either an
investment to support more environmentally-friendly companies - or to
support polluters.

In Taiwan, college students are concerned with environmental issues, yet
lack simple tools to influence systemic change towards sustainable
outcomes. Concurrently, in the European Union, new environmental
policies include the concept of *digital product passports (DPPs)*,
which aim to facilitate tracking data across the entire product
lifecycle, from source materials, until the consumer purchase decision,
and finally post-purchase recycling, building *transparency* into opaque
global supply chains. These new digital tools hold the potential to
benefit from *data-driven interaction design*, *large-language models*,
and *AI agents* to translate complex environmental data into
human-comprehensible language. If successful, DPPs may help to solve the
*attitude-behavior gap* by making it easy to distinguish *eco-designed
products* made by circular economy companies, striving to be *zero
waste*, from those merely engaged in *greenwashing*.

I leverage *design research* to find design concepts for *simple
AI-based generative user interfaces* to help young adults participate in
*sustainable financial actions*. Throughout the process, I conducted a
survey of over 900 students from 20 universities across Taiwan,
in-person user testing with 30 participants, and 7 expert interviews.
The major contribution of the study is an interactive AI-companion
prototype.
