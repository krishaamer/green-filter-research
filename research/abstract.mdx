## The Journey from Consumer to Investor: Designing a Financial AI Companion for Young Adults to Help With Sustainable Shopping, Saving, and Investing

As of 2025, Earthâ€™s natural environment is being heavily degraded by the
extractive business practices of companies that make many of the
products and services we buy every day. The emerging field of *planetary
health* recognizes profound interconnections between our economic
behaviors, ecosystem services such as clean water, air, soil, the
climate crisis, and human health. The way we use money to interact with
companies - through shopping, or saving and investing - impacts the
life-supporting biosphere we depend on. In essence, from an ecological
perspective, every financial action is either an investment decision to
support more environmentally-friendly companies - or to support
polluters.

In Taiwan, college students are concerned with environmental issues, yet
lack simple tools to effectively influence systemic change towards
sustainable outcomes. Concurrently, in the European Union, new
environmental policies include the concept of *digital product passports
(DPPs)*, which aim to facilitate tracking data across the entire product
lifecycle, from source materials, until the consumer purchase decision,
and finally post-purchase recycling, building *transparency* into opaque
global supply chains. These new digital tools hold the potential to
benefit from *data-driven interaction design*, *large-language models*,
and *AI agents* to translate complex environmental data into
human-comprehensible language. If successful, DPPs may help to solve the
*attitude-behavior gap* by making it easy to distinguish *eco-designed
products* made by circular economy companies, striving to be *zero
waste*, from those merely engaged in *greenwashing*.

My research focuses on college students and addresses the need for tools
to make sustainable financial action more convenient. I leverage *design
research* to find design concepts for *simple AI-based generative user
interfaces* to help young adults participate in *sustainable financial
activism*. Throughout the process, I conducted a survey of over 900
students from 20 universities across Taiwan, face-to-face user testing
with 30 participants, and 6 expert interviews providing industry
insights. The major contribution of the study is an interactive
AI-assistant prototype.
