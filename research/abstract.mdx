## The Journey from Consumer to Investor: Designing a Financial AI Companion for Young Adults to Help With Sustainable Shopping, Saving, and Investing

The emerging field of *Planetary Health* recognizes profound
interconnections between our economic behaviors, ecosystem services
(water, air, soil), the climate crisis, and human health. In essence,
how we use money to interact with companies - through shopping, or
saving and investing - impacts the life-supporting biosphere we depend
on. From an ecological perspective, every financial action is either an
investment to support more environmentally-friendly companies - or to
support polluters.

In Taiwan, college students genuinely care about environmental issues,
yet seen through the lens of the *Theory of Planned Behaviour* (TPB)
their attitudes alone are not enough: they also need reinforcing social
norms and a sense of behavioural control. European Union initiatives
such as digital product passports (DPPs) have the potential to supply
those missing pieces, giving students a common data-driven benchmark
(norms) and arming each person with sustainability facts at the moment
of choice (control).

In my inquiry, I leveraged *design research* to find design concepts for
*simple AI-based generative user interfaces* to help young adults
participate in *sustainable financial actions*. Throughout the process,
I conducted a survey of over 900 students from 20 universities across
Taiwan, in-person user testing with 30 participants, and 7 expert
interviews. The major contribution of the study is an interactive
AI-companion prototype.
