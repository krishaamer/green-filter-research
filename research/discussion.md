## Results {#results}

The research helps me (and others) to avoid reinventing the wheel and duplicating existing approaches. It aims to help app developers maximise impact by aiding complementary additionality.

#### How might AI assistants empower regenerative shopping, saving, and investing? {#how-might-ai-assistants-empower-regenerative-shopping-saving-and-investing}

Display the ESG, EPR, B-Corp, etc, etc credentials for each product and investment.

EPR and B-Corp are success stories which shoul be highlighted while ESG is largely discredited.

There are many existing and ongoing approaches to sustainability. The best approach might be to plug into excisting system and communities and legislation to support and empower them.

## Research Limitations {#research-limitations}

-   This work is focused on user experience design and does attempt to make a contribution to economics. Sacred Economics is use as-is as a framework and visualization tool.

-   First, finance is a highly regulated industry and the proposed user experience designs may be limited by legal requirements. This study does not take such limitations into account, rather focusing only on the user experience.

-   Finally, ESG needs data to give us an accurate understanding of the realities inside companies and the user experience design does not address the underlying data quality problem further than by providing a link to the data source.

-   Research Reason: While many people are working on AI models, there’s a lack of people working on “Human-AI interaction”. Sustainability is the context. How can we better team up to solve the challenges we face this century? The huge externalities.
