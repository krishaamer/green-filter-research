## Research Limitations {#research-limitations}

-   This work is focused on user experience design and does attempt to
    make a contribution to economics. Sacred Economics is use as-is as a
    framework and visualization tool.

-   First, finance is a highly regulated industry and the proposed user
    experience designs may be limited by legal requirements. This study
    does not take such limitations into account, rather focusing only on
    the user experience.

-   Finally, ESG needs data to give us an accurate understanding of the
    realities inside companies and the user experience design does not
    address the underlying data quality problem further than by
    providing a link to the data source.

-   Research Reason: While many people are working on AI models, there’s
    a lack of people working on “Human-AI interaction”. Sustainability
    is the context. How can we better team up to solve the challenges we
    face this century? The huge externalities.
