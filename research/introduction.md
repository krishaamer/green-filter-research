# Introduction {#introduction}

In 1896, the Nobel Prize winner Svante Arrhenius first calculated how an increase in CO2 levels would have a warming effect on our global climate. 120 years later, in 2016, the Paris Agreement came into effect, with countries agreeing on non-binding climate targets, which most countries are failing to meet. In August 2018, Greta Thunberg skipped school to start a climate strike in front of the Swedish parliament Riksdag. Millions of people joined her Fridays for Future protests around the world and Time magazine named Thunberg person of the year in 2019 for *creating a global attitudinal shift* (Deutsche Welle, 2019; Time, 2019).

While awareness of Earth’s operating systems is growing, the CO2 emissions keep rising too. The hockey-stick growth of CO2 concentration since the industrial revolution is clear in the data from 1958 onward in Keeling and Keeling (2017) and includes estimations going back 2000 years from Rubino et al. (2019). In 2022, the world population of 8 Billion people emitted 37.5 gigatonnes of CO2, the highest emissions in world history, following a steady annual increase (Statista, 2023a). Removal of 5-20 gigatonnes of CO2 per year would be needed to limit global warming to 1.5 °C according to the reduction pathways calculated by the IPCC (Wade et al., 2023). Yet, we’re missing the mark. Given this model, the G7 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, United States) to take one example, were heading for 2.7 °C of warming by 2050 (CDP, 2022). The monumental task of removing several gigatonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere requires massive policy shifts and collaboration across countries and industries (Mackler, Fishman and Broberg, 2021).

Yet CO2 emissions is not the only problem facing humanity. In January 2022, the Stockholm Resilience Centre reported that humanity had breached 4 out of our 9 planetary boundaries; in addition to climate change, biodiversity loss, land-system change, and biogeochemical flows (Persson et al., 2022).

Consumer lifestyle contributes to environmental destruction. According to Ellen MacArthur Foundation, Material Economics (2019)’s models show 45% of CO2 equivalent emissions come from our daily shopping, produced by companies that make the products we consume. A large scale study by Anthony Leiserowitz et al. (2022) on Meta’s Facebook (n=108946) reported people in Spain (65%), Sweden (61%), and Taiwan (60%) believe “climate change is mostly caused by human activities”. An even larger survey (n=1.2 million) by the United Nations across 50 countries, distributed through mobile game ads, showed the majority of people agreeing climate change is an “emergency” UNDP (2021). While people express eco-conscious ideas, it’s non-trivial to practice sustainability in daily life. Deyan Georgiev (2023a) reports only 30% of people in the Gen-Z age group believe technology can solve all problems.

| Age Group | Agree | Neutral or Disagree |
|-----------|-------|---------------------|
| 18-35     | 65%   | 35%                 |
| 36-59     | 66%   | 34%                 |
| Over 69   | 58%   | 42%                 |

“Climate change is an emergency” UNDP (2021).

The theme for this year’s Earth Day was *“Invest In Our Planet”* Earth Day (2023) and it’s very apt as Anon. (2016) estimates the global financing gap for low-carbon energy production in 2016 was 5.2 Trillion USD. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) calculates the world needs an additional 4.1 Trillion USD of financing in nature by 2050 to meet climate change, biodiversity, and land degradation targets (UNEP, 2022). And according to The Rockefeller Foundation (2022) a slightly lower 2.5-3.2 Trillion USD would be sufficient. In any case, even with massive financing going into sustainability, there’s still a lack of investing, and it’s not happening fast enough. The lack of funding in green energy especially affects emerging economies, reminds us Anon. (2022). “We can and must channel private capital into nature-based solutions. This will require policy and regulatory support, catalytic capital and financial innovation” said the CEO Green Finance Institute, Dr Rhian-Mari Thomas, ahead of COP27 in Egypt (Anon., 2023).

Comparative data on needed climate investment and other valuable assets; all figures in trillions of USD Stephanie Aaronson and Aaron Tilley (2023)

However, the needed investment doesn’t seem so large, coming in at 2.5-5.2 % of the global GDP, if we compare it to the *per year* Global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) estimated at around 100 Trillion USD in 2022 and growing to 105 Trillion USD in 2023 (Aaron O’Neill, 2023; International Monetary Fund, 2023). In essence, the estimated total investment gap in climate fits into the economic growth of 1 year of the global economy.

### Defining the Problem Space {#defining-the-problem-space}

Does individual climate action help?

-   “Like climate change, the focus on individual actions as a solution is often misplaced, though it remains a focus of media and industry. For decades, the petrochemical industry has offloaded responsibility onto individuals through promoting concepts such as the”carbon footprint”, championed in a 2004 advertising campaign by British Petroleum” Lavers, Bond and Rolsky (2022).
-   Individual efforts are too small to matter unless they’re inspired by Community a effort

## Research Relevance {#research-relevance}

This research is timely in 2023 because of the convergence of five trends:

| Trend                                                                    |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Growing environmental degradation                                        |
| Young people demand for sustainability                                   |
| Young people have money; intergenerational money transfer to the youth   |
| Improved sustainability metrics and instruments such as ESG, B Corp, etc |
| Technology adoption and AI-based user interface availability             |

Current trends backing the relevance of this research project.

-   The current environmental upheaval, led by Gen-Z and Millennials, and the business adaptation (or lack thereof) to sustainable economic models, taking into account the hidden social and environmental costs we didn’t calculate in our pricing before.
-   We also need to consider environmental effects (E in ESG). We haven’t taken into account the whole cost of production, leading to the wrong pricing information. To achieve this, we need expert governance (G).
-   and protecting biodiversity

**There’s evidence young people have money.** In the U.S. alone, the combined annual consumer spending of Gen-Z and Millennials was over 2.5T USD in 2020 (YPulse, 2020). Over the coming decade, in the U.S., UK, and Australia, Millennials are inheriting 30T USD from their parents (Calastone, 2020). There’s also some evidence of investment interest, however there’s large geographic variance. According to a Calastone (2020) study (n=3000) surveying people in the Millennial age group between ages 23 and 35 in Europe (UK, France, Germany), U.S.A., Hong Kong, and Australia, 48% of respondents located in Hong Kong owned financial securities (such as stocks) while the figure was just 10% in France.

| Place     | Percentage |
|-----------|------------|
| Hong Kong | 48%        |
| France    | 10%        |

## Research Background {#research-background}

I grew up reading science fiction books and their influence on my outlook towards future possibilities continues until present day. Star Trek has a portable device called a ***tricorder*** (fig. 1), which enables imaginary future humans fix all kinds of problems from scanning for minerals inside a cave to scanning human bodies for medical information. I would love to have such a device for consumer choices and financial decisions - to know what to buy and which businesses to do business with. Robots are already integral part of our lives; this thesis proposal was partially written using Google’s and Apple’s Voice recognition software, allowing me to transcribe notes with the help of an AI assistant.

As a foreigner living in Taiwan, I’ve relied extensively on Google Maps’ AI assistant to move around efficiently, including to find food and services, when writing in Chinese, Apple’s text prediction algorithms translate pinyin to 漢字. Even when we don’t realize it, AI assistants are already helping us with many of our mundane tasks. While it takes incredibly complex computational algorithms to achieve this in the background, it’s become so commonplace, we don’t even think about it. From this point of view, another AI assistant to help us with greener shopping decisions, saving CO2, and investing in more eco-friendly businesses doesn’t sound so much of a stretch.

## Research Motivation {#research-motivation}

-   Given these facts, what can people who want to preserve Earth’s human-friendly environment, exactly do? How can networks of people come together solve climate change, curb deforestation, support mobility and green buildings, etc?

-   Oboarding more people for sustainable practices is a complex interaction design issue hindered by ambiguous data (what is sustainable?) and messy human motivations (we love buying things).

    Health tracking apps paired with connected devices such as Apple Watch filled with sensors provide one model of simple interactions to build a **quantified self** in a dynamically track health data. This data allows apps to provide tips how to improve health outcomes through small daily actions such as climbing more stair or drinking more water. Small interactions allow users to align their value with their actions.

    What would be a good interface to track sustainability?

-   One way to influence societal outcomes is to decide where to put our money. What is the user interface at scale, useful for billions of diverse users to make a meaningful impact? While our financial decisions are a vote towards the type of businesses we want to support, it’s not enough to ***switch to green***.

For the average person, our experience is limited with buying things at the supermarket. Food, clothes, furniture, soap, mobile phone.

-   Green Supermarket
-   Green Savings
-   Green Investing
-   First, while young people are demanding sustainability, and progressive governments and companies are increasingly announcing green investment opportunities, how can consumers discover the most suitable investment options for their situation? How can potential sustainability-focused retail investors access and differentiate between eco-friendly investable assets? The level of knowledge of and exposure to investing varies widely between countries.
-   Secondly, could linking green consumption patterns with sustainable investing provide another pathway to speed up achieving climate justice as well as personal financial goals? For example, in this simplified scenario, I’m in a physical offline store, doing some shopping. When putting a bottle of Coca Cola in my basket, my ***financial AI advisor Susan*** (fig. 2, above) will ask me a personalized question (fig. 3):

## Research Objective {#research-objective}

Where does our money go and what are some greener alternatives?

This is largely due to the production and manufacturing processes of the companies that make the products we consume on a daily basis.

-   An AI companion app that seeks to help people build relationships with sustainability-focused companies and enables people to be more transparent and responsible in their consumption behavior.

-   How can people shop, save & invest sustainably? The study presents an AI companion design which seeks to help people build relationships with sustainability-focused companies. The major contribution of this study is an interactive artefact (a prototype) informed by design research.

-   Q: “it seems impossible to know which company is more sustainable than the other” we don’t really know what’s green?

-   in their sustainability report every company looks perfect

-   My interest lies in understanding how AI assistants can help conscious consumers become sustainable investors.

-   The purpose of this study is to explore how to provide the best user experience to potential sustainable financial AI companion users.
