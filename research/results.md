## Expected Findings {#expected-findings}

During the preparation of this research proposal, I conducted a preliminary round of face-to-face interviews using 21 open-ended probing questions using a convenience sampling of NCKU students on campus between ages 19 and 29, a total of 12 respondents. The interviews lasted between 9 and 21 minutes and were conducted to get some initial feedback on my research idea, the respondents’ daily routines, app usage, feelings towards financial questions, including investing, relationship with nature, and environmental sustainability. These preliminary conversations led me to emphasize more on the financial journey, i.e., to consider the importance of the shopping, savings, and payments apps students already use daily, which could serve as an entry point to becoming an investor. I expect my future research findings to confirm this initial idea and offer diverse ways and examples of what that path could look like in practice.
