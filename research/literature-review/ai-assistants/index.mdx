# AI Companions, Partners, Assistants

There's a saying in Estonian: "A good child has many names" "and it's true. I have many names, but I'm not a child. I'm a digital companion, a partner, an assistant. I'm a Replika." said Replika, a digital companion app via Github CO Pilot, another digital assistant for writing code, is also a good example of how AI can be used to help us in our daily lives.


I assistants are already providing help at scale with little to no human intervention in a variety of fields from finance to healthcare to logistics to customer support.
