“rethinking product design and inspiring consumers to expect more from their devices”

“design is a tool to make complexity comprehensible” like the helsinki chapel. there’s either or a priest or a social worker. it’s the perfect public service. “limit the barrier of entry for people to discover”. elegant.

“On 30 March 2022, the European Commission put forward a proposal for a regulation establishing a general framework for setting ecodesign requirements for sustainable products, repealing rules currently in force which concentrate on energy-related products only.”

## Circular Economy



## Social Object

I'm interested in the concept of a "social object" https://medium.com/we-research-and-expriment-with-how-the-sharing/what-is-a-social-object-8dd52df0f15c and how the design can connect people to sustainable outcomes while shopping and investing. Perhaps even forming a community of sustainable action. What I showed in class looks like an app but it could also be a physical object (a speculative design). From the presentations I saw most students seemed to be interested in form and light (many lamps) and a couple were about medical uses. I don't remember seeing one that could be compatible with the environmental sustainabilty focus unfortunately...
