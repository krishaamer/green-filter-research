# Literature Review

## 2.1. Sustainable Investing
My research aims to find ways to enable a wider audience to access sustainable investment opportunities. This chapter gives an overview of the current (as of late 2020) sustainable investing landscape as well as future trends related to interaction design and user experience innovations (fig. 4).

### 2.1.1. What is Sustainable Investing?
There's a growing literature suggesting it's possible to make investments that both make an attractive financial return and adhere to sustainability goals. In housing development, there's evidence of ‘green’ buildings achieving a ‘higher financial return than conventional buildings, both in terms of rent and sale price’ (Oyedokun, 2017). There's also a trend of investors looking for sustainability in addition to profits in a few countries. For example
In Sweden “Preferences for sustainable and responsible equity funds - A choice experiment with Swedish private investors” (Lagerkvist et al., 2020)
74% of Chinese youth are looking for "positive impact" (Smith, 2019)
Philanthropy is on the rise in Asia (Lingeswaran, 2019) however investors are not sure how to separate sustainable assets from less sustainable ones (Ho, 2019)

### 2.1.2. Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG)
Recently, international bodies, governments, and private corporations have developed sustainability measurement metrics, the prominent one being ESG (Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance). This rating system has already been implemented or is in the process of being adopted on stock markets all over the world and has implications beyond the stock markets, allowing analysts to measure companies’ performance on the triple bottom line: the financial, social, and environmental metrics. The Taipei stock market in Taiwan has listed ESG stocks since 2017 and was hailed by Bloomberg as a regional leader in ESG reporting (Grauer, 2017), while Nasdaq Nordic introduced an ESG index in 2018, and Euronext, the largest stock market in Europe, introduced an ESG index and a series of derivative instruments in the summer of 2020 (Euronext, 2020).

Many ecologically focused funds with different approaches have been launched in recent years, with variations in asset mix and style of management. Thematic asset management is expected to grow, with investors packaging opportunities based on consumer trends (Doorn, 2020), for example, digital payments and circular bioeconomy (Kirakosian, 2020), even using tactics such as co-branding with famous individuals. A recent example is one of the largest private banks in Switzerland, Lombard Odier & Co, when they launched a thematic bioeconomy fund inspired by the words of The Prince of Wales, ‘Building a sustainable future is, in fact, the growth story of our time' (Jersey Evening Post, 2020).

ESG gives banks a new tool to market and sell environmentally conscious opportunities to institutional investors, for example, universities - a case in point being the recent partnership between HSBC and the University of Edinburgh (Reid, 2020). PWC suggests “asset managers educate their staff and client base. ‘It will be critical to build stronger ESG expertise among their employees by upskilling existing staff on ESG principles and strategically scout for and integrate more diverse and ESG-trained talent’” (PWC, 2020). The advice consultancies are providing to banks establishes a common language and helps banks to sell strategical alignment for long-term institutional sustainability in terms of finance, social, and governance.

For AI-powered assistants to be able to provide guidance, metrics are needed to evaluate sustainable assets, and ESG provides the current state-of-the-art for this. The largest obstacle to eco-friendly investing is greenwashing where companies and governments try to portray an asset as green when in reality it's not. A personal investing assistant can provide an interface to focus on transparency, highlighting data sources and limitations, to help users feel in control of their investment decisions, and potentially even provide large-scale consumer feedback on negative practices back to the business through infringement discovery.

### 2.1.3. Governments and Legislation
Changes to laws and regulations aimed at achieving climate change mitigation is a key driver behind the wave of ESG adoption (PWC, 2020). The goal of these laws, first adopted in the European Union, a self-proclaimed leader in eco-friendliness, is to pressure unsustainable companies to change towards greener practices, in fear of losing their access to future capital, and to create a mechanism forcing entire environmentally non-compliant business sectors to innovate towards sustainability unless they want to suffer from financial penalties. On the flip side of this stick and carrot fiscal strategy, ESG-compliant companies should feel incentivized by access to cheaper capital and larger investor demand from ESG-friendly investors.

Already in 2001, the UK government was discussing ways to promote sustainable investment "fundamental changes in VAT or corporation taxes could be used to promote greener consumption and investment" (House of Commons, 2002), however systemic change is slow. The European Union fully recognizes the changing financial landscape trending towards the democratization of investments: "more investors have become active in the financial markets and are offered an even more complex wide-ranging set of services and instruments." (Directive 14 2014/65/EU, 2014). Some key legislation for investors has been put in place recently, for example, "MiFID II is a legislative framework instituted by the European Union (EU) to regulate financial markets in the bloc and improve protections for investors." (Kenton, 2020) "MiFID II and MiFIR will ensure fairer, safer and more efficient markets and facilitate greater transparency for all participants" (European Securities and Markets Authority, 2017).

While the larger trend is for governments to adapt to and work towards their environmental climate commitments and public demand, the sovereign risk remains an issue. For example, the policies supported by U.S. President Trump during his presidency ran counter to many sustainability recommendations, including those directed at the financial markets (Quinson, 2020), helping legacy industries stay competitive for longer through subsidies, and lack of regulation, or even regulation supporting legacy technologies.

### 2.1.4. Banks, Fintech, and Payments
While the financial industry is highly digitized, plenty of banks are still paper-oriented, running digital and offline processes simultaneously, making them slower and less competitive, than startups. Indeed, the new baseline for customer-facing finance is set by fintech, taking cues from the successful mobile apps in a variety of sectors, foregoing physical offices, and focusing on offering the best possible online experience for a specific financial service, such as payments. The European Central Bank describes fintech as improving the user experience across the board, making interactions more convenient, user-friendly, cheaper, and faster. "Fintech has had a more pronounced impact in the payments market [...] where the incumbents have accumulated the most glaring shortcomings, often resulting in inefficient and overpriced products," Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB (Bank, 2019).
Using digital payments instead of cash enables a new class of experiences, in terms of personalization, and potentially, for sustainability. According to McKinsey, Asia has shown the fastest growth in payments in the world (McKinsey, 2020). Meanwhile, in Europe, point of sales (PoS) lending is a common practice in Sweden, and one of the reasons for the success of Klarna, the Swedish banking startup, which has managed to lend money to more consumers than ever, through this improved user experience. Taking out loans for consumption is a questionable personal financial strategy at best. If people can loan money at the point of sales, why couldn't there be 180 degrees opposite service - pointof sales investing?

A Dutch fintech company Bunq (fig. 5) offers payment cards for sustainability, provided by MasterCard, which connects everyday payments to green projects, such as planting trees and donations to charities within the same user interface (Bunq, 2020). Sharing a similar goal to Alibaba's Ant Forest, Bunq's approach creates a new interaction dynamic in a familiar context (card payments), enabling customers to effortlessly contribute to sustainability. However, it lacks the level of gamification which makes Alibaba's offering so addictive, while also not differentiating between the types of purchases the consumer makes, in terms of the level of eco-friendliness.

If corporate social responsibility (CSR) loyalty programs, driven by points systems are useful, can we go a step further, and create a pathway to enable the consumer to become an investor in the company they like to buy from? Could this strategy provide more meaning for the consumer, leading to higher customer retention, as well as financial returns? The following popular (totaling millions of users) robo-advisory apps combine sustainability, personalization, ethics, and investing (fig. 6) - however, they are mostly only available on the US market:

Financial AI companion apps have not yet grown to mainstream scale in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Europe, being for the moment a largely US-based retail investor trend. The apps outside of the US are niche products in a nascent stage, however, they still provide relevant design directions or stories of what to avoid. For example, in India, research is being conducted on how AI advisors could assist with investors' erratic behavior in stock market volatility situations, albeit without much success (Bhatia et al., 2020).

In Europe, Germany and the United Kingdom show the way with the most robo-advisory usage (Cowan, 2018), with ETFmatic (fig. 7) gaining the largest number of downloads by 2017 (AltFi, 2017), focusing exclusively on exchange-traded funds (ETFs), tracking stock-market indexes automatically, with much less sophistication, than their US counterparts. However, while Germany has 30+ robot-advisors on the market, with a total of 3.9 billion EUR under robotic management, it's far less than individual apps like Betterment manage in the US (Bankinghub, 2019). In the UK, several robo-advisors have shut down recently (AltFi Insights, 2019).

While, as I've shown, the financial AI companion apps in the US market are ahead globally, they are not yet using many of the user experience innovations that are prevalent on social media platforms targeted at Generation Z and/or Millennials, possibly presenting an opportunity for cross-industry knowledge transfer, from businesses that are traditionally closer to the consumer - such as retailers.

### 2.1.5. Conscious Consumerism, Loyalty, and Savings
Building customer loyalty is a key part of repeat business and financial predictability, which any company is aiming for. Large consumer brands like Starbucks have for long ran successful rewards programs that encourage customers to come back. Meanwhile, business consultancies have begun to recognize the importance of design to business (McKeough, 2018) and advise their corporate clients to bring user experience design to the core of their business operations. The same applies to interacting with sustainable finance; for the 'green-minded' demographics, providing a reliable green product is a way to build customer loyalty. The 2020 Green Fintech Trends report predicts the rise of personalizing sustainable finance, because of its potential to grow customer loyalty, through improving the user experience (Green Finance Platform, 2020). While the CEO of the Swedish clothing producer H&M, one of the largest fast- fashion in the world, recognizes the potential impact of conscious consumers (Hoikkala, 2019), he sees it as a threat, not as an opportunity. Meanwhile, success stories integrating previously distinct experiences with sustainability have shown positive results, for example, Alibaba's Ant Forest simultaneously raising money for planting forests and building loyalty, leading the company to consider further avenues for gamification and eco-friendliness.
From building loyalty to building ownership, the first step is to start saving money to invest. How to encourage savings in daily life and make it a part of the everyday payments experience? Even starting with a small step, gathering a small target amount per month for savings, has the potential to shift the user's way of thinking about money. The second step, choosing where to invest these savings, will help us begin thinking like an investor. To start noticing trends and looking into how finance shapes the world. In the words of a Canadian investment blogger, “every dollar you spend or invest is a vote for the companies and their ethical and sustainability practices" (Fotheringham, 2017).

Could investing as a pathway from a loyalty scheme strengthen the feeling of connection with the business even further? After all, I'm now a minority owner! What are the standard conversations about money and savings that I would traditionally have with a financial advisor, that could be converted into a portable, mobile form, in my pocket every day?

### 2.1.6. Chatbots, AI Assistants and Robo-Advisors
The user experience (UX) of artificial intelligence (AI) is a topic under active development by all the largest online platforms. The general public is familiar with the most famous virtual helpers, Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, Microsoft's Cortana, Google's Assistant, Alibaba's Genie, Xiaomi’s Xiao Ai, and many others for general, every-day tasks, such as asking factual questions, controlling home devices, playing media, making orders, and navigating the smart city. Smaller startups have created digital companions such as Replika (fig. 8), which aims to become your friend, by asking probing questions, telling jokes, and learning about your personality and preferences - to generate more natural-sounding conversations. Already on the market are several financial robo-advisors, built by fintech companies, aiming to provide personalized suggestions for making investments (Betterment, Wealthfront).
There have also been plenty of attempts to create different types of sustainability assistants. For instance, to encourage behavioral changes, the AI assistant Sebastian developed at the Danish hackathon series Unleash, used BJ Fogg’s 'tiny habits' model, nudged by a chatbot buddy to help the human maintain an aspirational lifestyle (Unleash, 2017). Also, personal carbon footprint calculators have been released online, ranging from those made by governments and companies to student projects, for example, Zhang's Personal Carbon Economy conceptualizing the idea of carbon as a currency used for buying and selling goods and services, as well as an individual carbon exchange to trade one's carbon permits (Zhang, 2018).

While I'm supportive of the idea of using AI assistants to highlight more sustainable choices, I'm critical of the tendency of the aboveexamples to shift full environmental responsibilityto the consumer, when sustainability is a complex interaction, where the producers' conduct can bemeasured and businesses can bear responsibility fortheir processes, even if there's market demand forpolluting products. Moreover, such personalsustainability projects haven't so far achievedmainstream success or widespread adoption,making the endeavor to influence human behaviorstowards sustainability with just an app - like itscommonplace for health and sports activity trackerssuch as Strava (fig. 9) -, seem unlikely. Personalnotifications and chat messages are not enoughunless they provide the right motivation. Could visualizing a connection to a larger system, showing the impact of the eco-friendly actions taken by the user, provide a meaningful motivation to the user, and a strong signal to the businesses?

All of the interfaces mentioned above make use of machine learning (ML), a tool in the AI programming paradigm for finding patterns in large sets of data, which enables making predictions useful in various contexts, including financial decisions. These software innovations enable new user experiences, providing an interactive experience through chat (chatbots), using voice generation (voice assistants), virtual avatars (adds a visual face to the robot), however
Figure 9: Popular Strava sports assistant provides run tracking and feedback - AI Financial Advisors will need to go further to motivate users. 
because of the nature of the technology, which is based on the quality of the data the systems ingest, they are prone to mistakes. Therefore, to reduce errors which only humans can detect, and provide a way to stop automation from going in the wrong direction, it's important to focus on making users feel in control of the technology (Holbrook, 2018).

### 2.1.7. Summary
"Investors want to know where their money is going", says Heike Reichelt, Head of Investor Relations at World Bank. (10 Years of Green Bonds, 2019) and this applies to both institutional and increasingly retail investors. Sustainable investing is possible due to consumer demand for greener products and services, and new tools such as ESG for measuring sustainable businesses and assets, as well as advancements in large-scale computational technologies to analyze large amounts of tracking data, comparing performance between different assets.
Given these developments, might it be possible to create a practical sustainable investing AI advisor for consumers?
