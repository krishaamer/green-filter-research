Realtime ESG
https://ctmfile.com/story/real-time-esg-data-on-supply-chains-a-breakthrough
“supply chain is a significant source of ESG content”
“Real-time ESG data is more difficult to greenwash”

“factory social score”.

People working at the factories can report conditions

“But the real breakthrough is how we can surface that real-time ESG data directly to individuals in the shops and online, linked to the products that they are browsing and potentially buying. This means that ESG change will finally be driven by the ultimate judge of business success – the customer.”
