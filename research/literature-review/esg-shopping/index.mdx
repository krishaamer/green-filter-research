“Around two-thirds of global GHG emissions are directly and indirectly linked to household consumption, with a global average of about 6 tCO2eq/cap. The average per capita carbon footprint of North America and Europe amount to 13.4 and 7.5 tCO2eq/cap, respectively, while that of Africa and the Middle East—to 1.7 tCO2eq/cap on average.”

“ establish consumption options with a high mitigation potential measured in tons of CO2eq/capita/yr.”

“Like climate change, the focus on individual actions as a solution is
often misplaced, though it remains a focus of media and industry. For
decades, the petrochemical industry has offloaded responsibility onto
individuals through promoting concepts such as the “carbon footprint”,
championed in a 2004 advertising campaign by British Petroleum
(Cherry and Sneirson, 2011). “
