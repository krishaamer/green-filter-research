# AI Interaction Design
This chapter gives an overview of the role I believe user experience design can play in improving the investing journey for both Generation Z and Millennials and identify the issue of out-of-date interaction design for Robo-Advisors in Europe, and the missed opportunity to provide an even more interactive experience in line with young adults' expectations in the most successful AI advisory apps on the US market.

### Design for Sustainability and Participation
Designer Alexandra Daisy Ginsberg says "Design can set agendas and not necessarily be in service, but be used to find ways to explore our world and how we want it to be" (Lorenzo et al., 2015). Practitioners of Participatory Design (PD) have for decades advocated for designers to become more activist through action research, which means aiming to influence outcomes, not only be a passive observer of phenomena as a researcher or only focusing on usability as a designer without taking into account the wider context. Design is increasingly relevant to algorithms, and more specifically to algorithms that affect user experience and user interfaces. When the design is concerned with the ethical, environmental, socio-economic, resource-saving, and participatory aspects of human-machine interactions and aims to affect technology in a more human direction, it can hope to create an experience designed for sustainability. Inviting domain expertise into the discussion while having a sustainable design process enables designers to design for experiences where they are not a domain expert; this applies to highly technical fields, such as medicine, education, governance, and in our case here - finance and sustainability -, while building respectful dialogue through participatory design (Shenoi, 2018).


### Data Visualisation

Long history, starting with Alexander von Humboldt.

### Interaction and Algorithmic Experience Design
To provide a user experience (UX) that best fits human needs, designers think through every interaction of the user with a system, considering a set of metrics at each point, for example, the user's emotional needs, and their context of use. While software designers are not able to change the ergonomics of the device in use in a physical sense, which as a starting point, should be "optimized for human well-being" (The International Ergonomics Association, 2019), software interaction design goes beyond the form-factor and accounts for human needs by using responsive design on the screen, aural feedback cues in sound design, and even more crucially, by showing the relevant content and the right time, making a profound difference to the experience, keeping the user engaged and returning for more. "[T]he moment of interaction is just a part of the journey that a user goes through when they interact with a product. User experience design accounts for all user-facing aspects of a product or system" (Babich, 2019).

In narrative studies terminology, it's a heroic journey of the user to achieve their goals, by navigating through the interface until a success-state. Storytelling has its part in interface design however designing for transparency is just as important, when we're dealing with the user's finances and sustainability data, which need to be communicated clearly and accurately, to build long-term trust in the service. For a sustainable investment service, getting to a state of success - or failure - may take years, and even longer. Given such long timeframes, how can the app provide support to the user's emotional and practical needs throughout the journey?

Affordance measures the clarity of the interface to take action in user experience design, rooted in human visual perception (Studio, 2018), however, affected by knowledge of the world around us. A famous example is the door handle - by way of acculturation, most of us would immediately know how to use it - however, would that be the case for someone who saw a door handle for the first time? A similar situation is happening to the people born today. Think of all the technologies they have not seen before - what will be the interface they feel the most comfortable with? For the vast majority of this study's target audience (18-35, Sweden and Taiwan), social media is their primary interface through which they experience daily life. The widespread availability of mobile devices, cheap internet access, and AI-based optimizations for user retention, implemented by social media companies, means this is the baseline for young adult users' expectations in 2020 - and even more so for the Generation Z teenagers, reaching adulthood in the next few years.

Interaction design is increasingly becoming dependent on AI. The user interface might remain the same in terms of architecture, but the content is improved, based on personalization and understanding the user at a deeper level. Shin proposes the model (fig. 10) of Algorithmic Experience (AX) "investigating the nature and processes through which users perceive and actualize the potential for algorithmic affordance" (Shin et al., 2020). That general observation applies to voice recognition, voice generation, natural language parsing, etc. Large consumer companies like McDonald’s are in the process of replacing human staff with AI assistants in the drive-throughs, which can do a better job in providing a personal service than human clerks, for whom it would be impossible to remember the information of thousands of clients. In the words of Easterbrook, a previous CEO of McDonald's “How do you transition from mass marketing to mass personalization?" (Barrett, 2019). During the writing of this proposal, Google launched an improved natural language engine to better understand search queries (Google, 2020), which is the next step towards understanding human language semantics. The trend is clear, and different types of algorithms are already involved in many types of interaction design, however, we're still in the early stages. Where do we go from here?

Lovejoy, lead UX designer at Google's people-centric AI systems department (PAIR), reminds us that while AI offers need tools, user experience design needs to remain human- centered - while AI can find patterns and offer suggestions, humans should always have the final say (Design Portland, 2018).

### Platform Economy and Speculative Design
The most successful businesses today (meaning largest in terms of numbers of users) look at the whole user experience, striving to design solutions that feel human and personalized for every touchpoint on the user journey (to use the language of service design) but doing so at the scale of hundreds of millions (or even billions) of users. The rise of the platform economy has given us marketplace companies like Airbnb and Uber that match idle resources with retail demand and optimize how our cities work. The massive amounts of data generated by these companies are used by smart cities to re-design their physical environments. With this perspective of scale, what would a shopping experience look like if one knew at the point of sale, which products are greener, and which are more environmentally polluting? What would a sustainable investment platform that matches green investments with the consumers look like, if one saw the side-by-side comparison of investment vehicles on their ESG performance?
These are both questions on the intersection of user experience design and speculation, which has been termed speculative design - making use of future scenarios to envision contexts and interactions in future use. Phil Balagtas, founder of The Design Futures Initiative at McKinsey, discusses the value of building future scenarios at his talk at Google (Google Design, 2019). One of his examples, the Apple Knowledge Navigator, from an Apple vision video in 1987, took two decades to materialize in the real world, inspired by a similar device first shown in a 1970s episode of Star Trek as a magic device (a term from participatory design), which then inspired subsequent consumer product development - and then another 2 decades, until the launch of the iPhone in 2007 - a total of 40 years!

In our investment AI advisor app's scenario, the AI is scanning for opportunities matching the user's sustainable investment appetite and risk profile, using different methods of analysis, including alternative data sources. Traditionally, financial analysts only looked at traditional data, such as company reports, government reports, historic performance, etc., for preparing advisory guidance to their clients. With the advent of AI and big data analysis, many other options of researchable data have become available, for example, accurate weather predictions for agriculture can affect guidance, because of expected future weather disasters in the area. Other examples include policy predictions, pollution metrics, etc.

Professional financial advisors use automated tools to analyze data and present it in human form to clients. Today's ubiquitous mobile interfaces, however, provide the opportunity to 'cut out the middleman' and provide similar information to clients directly, at a lower cost and a wider scale, often without human intervention. Additional (more expensive) "human-judgment- as-a-service", a combination of robots + human input, can help provide further personalized advice for the consumer, still at a cheaper price than a dedicated human advisor. Everyone can have a financial advisor. 

### Summary
The demographics that stand to win the most from the green transformation of business are the youngest generations, with more years of life ahead of them, and more exposure to future environmental and social risks. It would be advisable for Generation Z and their parents (Millennials) to invest their resources in greener assets, however, it’s still difficult to pick and choose between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ vehicles to invest in. This creates an opportunity for a new generation of sustainable investment apps, focusing on the usability and accessibility of ESG for a mainstream audience. Generation Z and Millennials expect a consumer-grade user experience. What would that experience look like? I’ve chosen these demographics with the assumption that if given the right tools, the emotional demand for sustainability could be transformed into action. The exploration of systems of feedback to enable consumers to apply more direct positive and negative pressure to the businesses and consumers signal consequences for undesirable ecological performance is a major motivation of this study.
